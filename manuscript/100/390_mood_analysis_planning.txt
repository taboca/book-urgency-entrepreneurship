Some activities naturally pose a challenge to initiate. Consider if you had to redesign your sales process, consider a new strategy, or to reflect about culture in the early stage of your start-up. These tasks often carry expectations and elicit strong emotions, as our minds prepare for a process of thoughtful analysis.

In truth, we naturally gravitate towards tasks where we feel we have a firm grip on the steering wheel. These are the activities where we're in control, where we can clearly see the road ahead and navigate the journey at our own pace.

Yet, when it comes to the more challenging tasks, we might feel anxiety or fear of losing this sense of progress. And we have good reasons, such as the desire to feel safe and adequately prepared for these types of activities. The notion of progressing through planning and analysis isn't as straightforward as following a recipe or even executing a labor-intensive task that, while energy-consuming, still lies within our known capabilities.

The repercussion of this is that we often feel we need to be in the right mood for certain tasks - to be prepared, ready, and have everything sorted out. This predicament was highlighted by Cameron (Cameron, 1998) in her book, 'The Right to Write', where she recognizes a phenomenon that plagues potential writers. Writing is a prime example of a task that may trigger the belief that we need to be ready, or in the right mood, before we can start.

Research: Look for the specific part in "Maslow on Management" where Abraham Maslow compares and contrasts the mindsets of a controller and a creative individual. Understand the context and implications of this comparison.

Analysis: Analyze the tension between trying to control the outcome of potentially risky unknown tasks and the subsequent pull towards this mindset. Consider how this tension might lead to the anxiety, expectation, and need to "be in the mood" before initiating certain tasks.

Connection: Investigate how Maslow's work supports the concept of needing to be in a certain mindset or mood to tackle challenging tasks. Draw connections between his theories and the ideas presented in your writing.
