## SCqA 

* Subject - Trying to do right, not embracing moving with errors, can lead to lower grade, poor results. 
* Situation - When want to do right, it's normal. For all, as we see an audience, strong. For a book, for a prototype, for a small store. 
* Complication - As we move, trying to do the right, we can be blocked, or comform, and end up with something of bad results. 
* QA - We can create supporting systems, for advancing with connection with ourselves, and less with what is right, permission to err. Can lead to opportuninies.

* Goal: Within the realm of the first section, we are reflecting about the "world as we know it" that pushes us towards a sort of pressured system of thought. We are not allowed to err, we are only allowed to do the right things. 

Consider an aspiring writer, that believes in her journey. We've learned a style of prose that, as Julia Cameron points out in The Right to Write, sometimes deters us from writing. We've been groomed with the mindset, "If you can't say anything nice - or nicely - don't say anything at all". In entrepreneurship, this same mindset pushes us towards a predefined "right way", but it's the errors, the path not taken, that holds a wealth of innovation.

Startup founders, in their quest for success, are often drawn to the bright, colorful stones of milestones - acquiring customers, getting investors, and getting results. But a closer look at the real stories of entrepreneurs will tell us that the path to success is strewn with stumbling stones and often, unexpected discoveries. So, what to do when the stones we thought were right aren't so right after all?

### The Big Question

The real issue here is the illusion of control over success, which isn't the creative mindset. We often fear the uncertain, the "bad", because it seems too painful, too risky. But what if the path we're afraid to tread is the one that leads to the good? This question leads us to a three-pronged solution.

### Answer: Three Supporting Pillars

Pillar One: Embrace the Opportunity Path
Inspired by Cameron, the first step is giving ourselves permission to step into the supposed "impossible path". This is the path that challenges us to write "badly," to err as an entrepreneur, and yet, it's a path that might lead to the very success we're striving for.

### Pillar Two: The Creative Balance

Our second pillar comes from Abraham Maslow's Maslow on Management. The goal here isn't to swing from one extreme to the other - it's about striking a balance. It's about stepping outside the pressure system of over-control, while not giving into a chaotic free fall.

### Pillar Three: Discovering Joy in Work

Lastly, work doesn't always have to be a struggle towards success. It can be about the simple joy that arises from doing, from engaging in the process itself. For Cameron, it's not about bad writing leading to good writing - it's about releasing the need to be perfect, to find a relaxed state of creativity. The same applies to entrepreneurship. When we let go of the need to control success, we might just find that work itself becomes liberating, joyful even.

### Conclusion: Goals are Important, but so is the Journey

So, while we need to set and track our goals, it's equally important to embrace the journey. Remember, real success stories aren't made from rigidly following the right stones, but from embracing the 'side B', the unexpected and uncontrolled. It's about managing the balance between the creative and the controlled, and finding joy in the process. This is the real entrepreneurial journey - the "bad entrepreneurship of good entrepreneurship".
