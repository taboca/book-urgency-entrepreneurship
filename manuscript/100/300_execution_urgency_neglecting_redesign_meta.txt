* ( ) Anedoctal of Marcio - when Marcio had insight and told Michael that the major problem was of a party, for what was nice, like flow. And not the denial to do the boring. So the doing the so good things led to use of energy in excess.  Insigh of Marcio - Thank you Michael. Your reply resonated so much with things in my head, concerns, sometimes not clear; it adds so much clarity. A few months ago, I had, virtually speaking, screamed — ah! It's that freaking party the problem. The party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course). The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow. Insight of Michael, not a public quote, "Categorization --> clusters --> patterns --> priorities -- that's it exactly. Natural multi-taskers with a strong work ethic (that's what I hear in your opening above) can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them. That's a problem if you compound the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time. Thank you for the note. It's very helpful to see through your goggles."

* Irony - When we search for impact, we impact the possibility of searches 

* Subject - For all actions we decide, there is a price to pay. 
* Situation - We want to be helpful, to feel that we are somebody, We might go for effort, amazing. 
* Complication - When an effort sets a complication ahead, we might seek other duties, duties that could be simpler for us, or fun, or exciting, or where we don't have to fail as a result of judgement.

## Part 

* 1. Note, individual move is self measured by effort too. 

* Answer - Key 1 - How we do it and works - no controler, and creative, or efficient, although not effective for goals. The sky is the limit for a mind that wants to not do the homework. Some escaping is natural, and good. Notice the nature of release of control, such as a work towards aspiring goals. We now it works and may explain that we can and should do that. But by noticing the value, we also can notice the risks, that we will dead certain to get results. BUt also results in arbitrary might not reflect in goal-driven, plus, it may create other distractins too, after excitement. Plus, success is not garanteed too in the arbitrary. 

* Answer - key 2 - Reasons for blocking - We might be judging ourselves, not enabling room within the project for aspirational aspects, or setting it as commitment for something that demands research or learning. All sorts of difficult places can create a blocking space. The design of any goal that is difficult needs to account the capacity for delivery plus allow room for learning, and not punish by results. The complication is that we are running arbitrary and not getting comfortable with stating what is going to happen, and being okay with learning and failure. 

## Todo consider 

* ( ) In the book of Johann Hari, Stolen Focus, p.23, he Brings the situation that our limited "focus window" he didn't write window but he refers to limited ability to focus, conveys or supports our inclination to not be a me to fully engage with solving the challenges ahead of us. He refers to lack of attention causing too a social impact, lots of problems e everywhere. He asks why and suggests that "Em parte, penso eu, porque, quando a atenção se rompe, a solução de problemas também fica comprometida. " P.23

## Meta prior 

* Abstract - The abstract discusses the true cost of corruption of time/goals and its implications for entrepreneurs. It draws parallels between the time and energy spent managing corruption (the upper part of the iceberg) and the neglect of focusing on important issues that could prevent such problems in the first place (the lower part of the iceberg). The abstract suggests that entrepreneurs should avoid falling into a reactive mode of execution, solely focused on putting out fires, and neglecting strategic, which is pre-planning. It emphasizes the importance of balancing tactical execution with strategic thinking to address deeper problems and foster innovative solutions. The abstract also explores the dilemma of artists and entrepreneurs who juggle creation and management, emphasizing the need for better production management. The potential dangers of reacting to external pressures and feedback without considering the bigger picture are highlighted. Ultimately, the abstract emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and adaptability for entrepreneurs in order to prevent falling into the trap of reactive execution.
