## Part 

* 1. Note, individual move is self measured by effort too. 

* Answer - Key 1 - How we do it and works - no controler, and creative, or efficient, although not effective for goals. The sky is the limit for a mind that wants to not do the homework. Some escaping is natural, and good. Notice the nature of release of control, such as a work towards aspiring goals. We now it works and may explain that we can and should do that. But by noticing the value, we also can notice the risks, that we will dead certain to get results. BUt also results in arbitrary might not reflect in goal-driven, plus, it may create other distractins too, after excitement. Plus, success is not garanteed too in the arbitrary. 

* Answer - key 2 - Reasons for blocking - We might be judging ourselves, not enabling room within the project for aspirational aspects, or setting it as commitment for something that demands research or learning. All sorts of difficult places can create a blocking space. The design of any goal that is difficult needs to account the capacity for delivery plus allow room for learning, and not punish by results. The complication is that we are running arbitrary and not getting comfortable with stating what is going to happen, and being okay with learning and failure. 

## Todo consider 

* ( ) In the book of Johann Hari, Stolen Focus, p.23, he Brings the situation that our limited "focus window" he didn't write window but he refers to limited ability to focus, conveys or supports our inclination to not be a me to fully engage with solving the challenges ahead of us. He refers to lack of attention causing too a social impact, lots of problems e everywhere. He asks why and suggests that "Em parte, penso eu, porque, quando a atenção se rompe, a solução de problemas também fica comprometida. " P.23

## Meta prior 

* Abstract - The abstract discusses the true cost of corruption of time/goals and its implications for entrepreneurs. It draws parallels between the time and energy spent managing corruption (the upper part of the iceberg) and the neglect of focusing on important issues that could prevent such problems in the first place (the lower part of the iceberg). The abstract suggests that entrepreneurs should avoid falling into a reactive mode of execution, solely focused on putting out fires, and neglecting strategic, which is pre-planning. It emphasizes the importance of balancing tactical execution with strategic thinking to address deeper problems and foster innovative solutions. The abstract also explores the dilemma of artists and entrepreneurs who juggle creation and management, emphasizing the need for better production management. The potential dangers of reacting to external pressures and feedback without considering the bigger picture are highlighted. Ultimately, the abstract emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and adaptability for entrepreneurs in order to prevent falling into the trap of reactive execution.
