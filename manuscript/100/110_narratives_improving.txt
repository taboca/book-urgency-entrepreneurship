* Objection - 100% - Not sure how understanding of the narrative mechanisms can enable entrepreneurs to be aware of what they do how they do better. Are we talknig about our propensenty to doubt the importance of a narrative? Is this a concern for the entrepreneur as an end-user? Was the point of Marcio about distraction? 

* Motivation - 100% - narratives are improving, a lot has hero-based storytelling, guides/mentors, ways to progress with engagement mechanisms, with feedback mechanisms, with goal-orientation. Some of these narratives might also affect entrepreneurs to be oriented to the dynamics of narratives, to be captivated. Narrative potential might appear in platform systems, like collaborative spaces, where people interact. It may appear as by design or by some of the characteristics of user interactions. The "traits" of a system can guide people into continuing to be protagonists, to live within the contraints of the system.

* Subject - Narratives of systems can captivate us, we can get involved. It is difficult for us to be aware, and for entrepreneurs, it is important to notice. 
* Situation - A good narrative is engaging, life has a platform for narratives. 
* Complication - We can't review the story from an outside perspective, we can get involved as users, as human beings. But entrepreneurs can be trapped too, as users, into any platform that has a space for narratives, as founders or entrepreneurs, as we can fall into narratives that take us closer to our goals, or overwhelmed too. Multiple narratives in multiple systems too, multiple identities can get into our way.

* Asbtract - In today's digital age, where narratives are skillfully woven to captivate and consume our attention, it is essential for entrepreneurs to reclaim autonomy over their time and decisions. We know that a good narrative is good, can engage us, to pay attention if not to act. But now the digital narratives happen to be everywhere as platforms have matured as generators of narratives. This has modernized in ways that can trap us to focusing on the narratives within platforms. We will see how we experience this and reflect about the dynamics with the intention of improving our awareness, and discernment, so that we can resist being pulled by the narrative potential of digital systems. The focus shifts towards fostering a balanced entrepreneurial life, where goals are not dictated by external narratives but driven by authentic aspirations and consciousness.

Like the book of amigos da mente points, that lacks of gut microbiota might be inducing your habit and style, and also what Johann writes in the page 23. This perhaps suggest to us that network of data, what is injest, might be confusing founders. This may also be a good case, check p 23, for the narrative dilemma.

Similarly as pointed by Johan Hari, page.25, he wrote that he was blaming himself, that he wasn't disciplined enough. We happen to be judging ourselves all the time.

In today's digital age, where narratives are skillfully woven to captivate our attention, it is essential for entrepreneurs to reclaim autonomy over their time and decisions. We know that a good narrative is good, can engage us, to pay attention if not to act. But now the digital narratives happen to be everywhere as platforms have matured as generators of narratives. This has modernized in ways that can trap us to focusing on the narratives within platforms. We will see how we experience this and reflect about the dynamics with the intention of improving our awareness, and discernment, so that we can resist being pulled by the narrative potential of digital systems. The focus shifts towards fostering a balanced entrepreneurial life, where goals are not dictated by external narratives but driven by authentic aspirations and consciousness. 

In the pre-digital era, life was simpler. Travel back to 1885 in the heart of the Old West. Picture a farm where the day begins with the first light of dawn and the crowing of a rooster. Coffee steams on a wood-burning stove, and as the curtains of night unveil a sunny stage, a calf takes its first steps. However, that day's joy was soon eclipsed for a blacksmith by an unsatisfied outlaw customer. He returned, quick to blame the blacksmith for his horse's fall, attributing it to the new horseshoes, even though he had been riding drunk. Life, ever the grand stage, presents its ebb and flow, the miracle of nature, and the unpredictable shades of human nature. Both the uplifting and challenging moments sets us to be protagonists in front of the job to be done, as we fight for what matters.

Contrast this life with the life of Jane, back to the future. In the setting of 2025, the alertness of her day starts with a "rooster's crow" although coming from her "smart watch", which repeats multiple times a day according to various simultaneous schedules. The unveiling of her day runs of incessant events that welcomes her listen and act in ways of the digital that have no boundaries. 

### Jane's reality 

Jane had always been dreaming of living healthier lifestyle, although it was always difficult to get on track. Her journey began when she stumbled upon "Her-o-matic," a digital platform and service that promotes itself as "a seamsless experience for your health development plans, but having fun." As Jane has entered into the user experience, she was indeed seamlessly prompted with questions about her diet, exercise habits, and goals. Quite instantly, the system has created a custom tailored plan with daily workouts, meal suggestions, and mindfulness exercises. But nothing like a complex, or boring, two-year plan. Instead, she had experienced something fun, engaging, and suitable for starting now. In other words, the system has onboarded her in a friendly way using a digital character - coach Rooster. As weeks turned into months, Jane noticed the app's knack for introducing new product suggestions — everything from protein powders to advanced workout gear. But these didn't seem like arbitrary products - no. Coach Rooster has listened to her goals and all the integrated products seemed to really work in favor of her goals, her health plan. Some of these purchases served what coach Rooster calls "unlocking a new health status" which is basically about a feedback mechanism that shows her achievements, her progress. In other words, it seemed that coach Rooster became smarter, not only to keep track of her goals but to remind her of her achievements, and to engage her into purchasing products that would count in favor of her goal profile. The app introduced a social board where users started to share their achievements and top performers using sponsored products where about to get extra points that would be turned as prizes such as cupons. What Jane really loved from Her-o-matic is what they call "the leaderboard room," a place where she can see her rank position against others. According to coach Rooster, members are not competitors, even if they are better than you for a given week, you can still follow their steps, such as to see which practices they did, such as to buy the same products they use - actions that works to support your ranking status, so you can beat them, or better, teach them. According to coach Rooster, the experience is more like a sports team, as opposed to a war fight. One evening though, Jane had the opportunity for a pause, after securing the top spot for the 3rd week in a row. She was also feeling a bit overwhelmed about the checks every day and recharging her mobile phone, although coach rooster would never appear tired, never older, never stressed. 

## Narrative landscape builders 

The story of Jane logically prompt us to consider the interesting aspects of how technology can create a setting for a real life narrative to take place. In the story, it can be assumed that Jane has entered the system, and advanced, as she noticed the potential for improvements. Even if she was caught up in the whirlwind of purchasing products, she kept around as she saw value and the means to advance her plans. The story is, however, deserves an attention because of the evolution of narratives, or the narrative potential, in digital systems. Modern digital systems have reached a maturity level where their narratives is orchestrated by the protagonists, the users, because of many elements (such as coach Rooster) that are in fact coadjuvants so that the storied context can be developed. For the narrative to take place, the relationship has to be symbiotic - needs a mutual beneficial relationship between the different species - between the humans and the system. The narrative potential, for becoming real, comes after the fact that the user is in, the user buys in. Thus, what the system does is to recognize the nature of the job that the user is into (in the case of Jane is being healthier) and provide a guided narrative that helps her to close the gap. The elements presented by the system are not unlike the elements that one would live if she had a real coach, altough in real life is it not easy to stumble on good coaches all the time.    

In other words, the industry is continuously getting better in understanding the operating system of humans. As an example, consider the lessons from the game industry that are available to help entrepreneurs in other fields.   One example is from Jane McGonigal, Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World, that harnesses the power of games and their design principles - having a sense of purpose, achievement, and community - such as in order to address real-world challenges, improve our lives, and drive social change. 

Another practitioner has bundled a system, also highly influenced by game design. Game Thinking, of Amy Jo Kim, supports the process of development of new products, services, or experiences, so that they ar emore engaging and meaningful to users. Kim delves into the convergence of game design, lean/agile development, and design thinking to create products that resonate deeply with users. The system underscores the importance of the "mastery path," taking individuals from novices to experts through engaging experiences. By embracing game thinking, innovators can design products that not only capture attention but also evolve with users, fostering sustained engagement and loyalty. 

But not unlike life, the storied context in the narratives of real time can be also overwhelming, or can trick us. When we reflect about the potential of a narrative that is being done with an application, my hope is that we lift our awareness that the world of today has a lot more doors for all the sorts of interactions. And that all of these systems (more or less symbiotic) are getting greater and greater in creating narrative spaces for their users - both using optimizations and systems, such as AI algoritms, to optmize. 

## Narrative induced potential 

Now, moving towards another line of concern. Consider inducement of behavior. If you consider the story of the real nature, old west terms, the blacksmith case dealing with a outlaw, life has its ways, not exactly fate, although a degree of probability depending on the context. 

But when it is the time to look at narratives of a multisided marketplace, would it be the case that the narrative has a force towards possible outcomes? Would it be the case that all in front of us, also the life of entreprteneurs, might be creating narratives of a superb experience, narratives that have a bias for certain dynamics?

Perhaps our "tour" to check the human ability to control the narrative landscape, to decorate, to add guides, to set goals, and to be able to automate, sets us in the right spot to consider the inevitability where humans, especially when they are equipped with modern tools and systems ability to automate, will tend to pave a landscape so that narratives can be developed. It's not too different from paving roads in a city so that economic development and civil movment takes place. Thus, the landscape for the narratives, the coadjuvant elements that help protagonists, can and are likely inserted by hands of whoever wants to control what happens. 

Conversely, it is inevitable that humans, as they organize themselves with goals, will come up with narratives that explain, provide feedback, adds cohesion for support and collaboration, fosters the team towards a goal. Likewise to the systems-created narrative landscape of a game, or a social network, there is a social network of employees, or the team, and everybody's lives are happening with a symbiotic relationship with this team system. The narrative landscape takes place nevertheless. People, and the interactions that they do, will shape aspects of how the narrative unfolds.
