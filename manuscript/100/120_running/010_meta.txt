* Subject - Productivity will be considered, as we set goals. And we may not account what keeps us intact and what it takes to grow and into the ready to execute state. We need to transcend towards the enlighted worker. 

* Situation - We set we will work, he have aspirations and a starting path. We advance with effort and overfocus on specifics and fail to grow us, which take us to fail growing our startup. 

* Complication - Not looking at core of what makes productivity real, which is recognition of the readiness has prior design and investment. As startup requires growth, and the growth of being, the entrepreneur needs to open room, space, time, to transcend towards enlighted, passing the survival and passing the work ability, key results delivery. Has to break towards the next, seeing from above, connecting with what matters, reflecting, reasoning, listening to the song.
