Now if all or some of this makes a bit of sense we need to check using a modern case, a journey that started small and created impact to the world. For that I am using the iconic case of Airbnb, which is recognized [^footnote_blitzscaling_airbnb] by the Blitzscaling crew as a case that started with an idea and passed through the stages of growth. Like we did with the historical context of Harriet, we may first lock the world's forces, to consider that a world's potential 10x force were in the air, that the world wanted to push forward the sharing economy, which to the context of Airbnb had to do with enabling ways for people to stay in other people's houses; which weren't not invented but the modern world - of fears - may have created barriers for a while. With that, then the question goes back to the founder - to wonder if they are up to it? And like we did with Harriet, we may too help ourselves and, temporarily, assume that Airbnb's future was written, that Airbnb was to be the actual materialization of the modern experience about to happen to solve the problem of people staying at each other's homes. And like we did, we will go back to deconstruct that premise later. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_airbnb]: Airbnb and Brian's interview within the context of Blitzscaling is key, likely Airbnb and Brian's story had big impact in the construction of the Blitzscaling, likely through values. 

[^footnote_brian_earlyteam]: I am using the notion of Brian but just like we won't know what are the key elements inside one person, in the self, we won't know how much their characterization as a leader depends on others. With that, it is implied the role of his cofounder and friend, Joe Gebbia, and if we dig into that, we will certain find Brian's parents. The point here is that the word Brian is a good representation for the early stage exactly because of the strong and weak representation and the potential - a leader in the beginning can well just stop doing it and go back to do something else at any time. 

Now and focusing on the characterizations of Brian, or Brian's team [^footnote_brian_earlyteam] but let us use Brian for now, one is of the said *Infinite Learner*, and with that we can wonder how one learner learns in a way where they can scale and grow, from small wins and developing ties with the right networks of support. A quick reading from their situation, from far, brings me to wonder about luck. Brian was lucky. When questioned about learning, through the Blitzscaling interview, he said that to solve the problems ahead one needs to find the right source of knowledge, such as the right person in the network, but if accessing the right person is not possible, then there is the right book. He and Reid celebrated that *High Output Management* is one of these materials, and then they recognized too the moment, and the special person who had recommended the book to them.

Which brings us to honor an objection - to minimally notice that Brian were already next to Reid Hoffman, that Greylock had already invested in Airbnb, and that before all of that Brian's team had been accepted by YCombinator, and that YCombinator were already a top-tier accelerator in Silicon Valley, and that they were already recognized as a network of knowlege and a network for accessing top-tier investors. These are just a few observation that sets me to, again, not to be mad with the idea that all attempt of mapping lessons is pointless but to think that too many variables were in the air preventing a solid lesson to settle. 

But there are things to be taken from subtle givens, like the case of Harriet, that may well explain how Brian were able to go along with a) that world's 10x force and b) that destiny of Airbnb in the growth situation. In other worlds, Brian was not let go, through the stages of Blitzscaling. Which set us to wonder about characterizations, or the thing, which they had which enabled them to kept on building alliances with their support network, throughout the stages of growth. Two different moments of Airbnb, given by Brian, shows how his learning were both a learning and a movement of follow through that went along in syncronicity not only with what his grown up advisor roles were telling but actually enabling those advisors to learn with him. 

The first is a situation which Brian considered as one of the best advices, one which he got from Paul Graham that is also know as *Do Things that Don't Scale*: 

> *"Probably the most important single piece of advice I got, which is probably advice that is probably the most important advice I can give you, or one of the most important advice. He basically drew out this chart and he basically said, it's better to have 100 people that love you, 100 customers that love you, than a million customers that just sort of like you. In other words, if you have 100 people that absolutely love your product, they'll tell 100 people, and then they'll tell 100 people, or even 10 people, and this thing will grow. We call it growing virally. In fact, almost all movements in history have grown this way as well. There's like deeply passionate followers and they grow it. And they're customer advocates. And the problem is, in Silicon Valley, the general wisdom is, I need to build some app, this thing it needs to have this viral coefficient. I need to get millions of people to use it. And they gotta like it enough to share it. That's totally the wrong way to think about it, especially if you're in a service business like ours. So Paul Graham said, 'All you have to do is get 100 people to like you. Don't worry about millions of people.' That was totally freeing. 'Cause until then I was like, 'How the hell am I gonna get a million people to do this if I can't even get my mom or my sister to do it?' But I can find 100 people. And so we literally decided, do things that don't scale."* (Chesky, Brian., 2015, 22:13)


Now, if we listen to how he says that, if we hear his voice, we will feel how they were connected with the idea, how they felt as being set free, in other words, they had listened and gave permission themselves to do what they thought were right, as they felt a great alignment with their own values. A point should be made here is that they were both designers, now designer founders. This brought them to focus on what they thought were the right thing, which we may get a better picture by the recounting of the days when they, as founders, were flying to New York to help their hosts to improve their photos and their listings and their experience. They were not going there to take quick professional photos and come back. They were really listening to their hosts, living through, understanding the situation, through values. In other words they were celebrating life values in order to improve the whole experience. I'll tell you what this means from a different perspective. I was once visiting a profile of an apartment in the city of Sao Carlos in Brazil, which is a city where a couple major public universities. And I was scared to see a photo of the dirtiest kitchen sink ever as the cover photo. But then it took me only a couple seconds to understand that there's something very honest about that. When that early Airbnb team took that message, to do things that don't scale, they took it in a way that perhaps even scared, as in impressed, their advisors, like Paul Graham. In other words, I would think that Paul Graham, as a sort of master of scale (or a big general,) improved his views and strength of a message that were, at the time, yet so not strongly developed.

By reflecting about this kind of interactions, it becomes clear a synergistic interaction from these masters of scale, that they were actually learning with Brian's team, which explains when Reid Hoffman tells us that he has learned [^footnote_blitzscaling_reid_learning_with_brian] with Brian. This is about building strong alliance because of a listening that happens in both directions. This is about the understanding that throughout actions and through actions expressing values, they were actually forming strong alliances and growing through value by putting their playbook into practice. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_reid_learning_with_brian]: Marcio, pick the moment from the Blitzscalingn lecture where Reid honestly revels that he learned with Brian. 


Now, just like in Harriet's story, there is here also a moment that can be a climax, if we were too fast to consider, through Airbnb history, but one that in fact shows how these founders and their startup and their supporters, the stakeholders, were all together being creative and supporting themselves to go through and pass and to solve the major problem. This specific moment throughout the history of Airbnb is known as a specific battle which consisted of the incident where two brothers, the Samwer brothers, came their way. They were professionals in terms of materializing a startup in the growth situation. When Brian's team called their alliances to understand situation they understood that if these brothers target your startup, you are death, or may, if you could, buy them. Needless to say then that these kids were lost, in the face of what seemed to be an evil planet approaching earth. This is when, again, it appears the figure - like of a dungeon master - of Paul Graham, which again gave them again, one in particular which came again to be considered as the best advice, that "you are missionaries, they are mercenaries. You should basically just pretend like they had this baby, but they don't wanna raise the baby." And Brian's team had listened to that, and through that he again had understood values: 

> *"And so I thought, well we're founders. We wanna grow this company. So I'm like a parent and I want this child to grow into this wonderful company. And so I said... Well, I didn't say this to Oliver Samwer, but my view was, my biggest punishment, my biggest revenge on you is, I'm gonna make you run this company long term. So you had the baby, now you gotta raise the child. And you're stuck with it for 18 years. 'Cause I knew he wanted to sell the company, I'm like, "No, no. You're running this company." And I knew he maybe could move faster than me for a year, but he wasn't gonna keep doing it. And so that was our strategy. And we built company long term. And the ultimate way we won is, we had a better community. He couldn't understand community."* Brian (Greylock, 2015, 1:6:00)

So through values they kept on building their strongest value. And through their product they were able to let their community do that as well. In other words, the community were too growing with them. For me, a major lesson to be taken from the story of Harriet and the story of Brian has to do with the lessons being taken from the generals of the past and the advisors of Brian's day. And this, again, take us to deconstruct that premisse, of destiny: Is it that they were essentially following through or were these soldiers or the community charging themselves with creativity being unblocked by fears and launching themselves? Who shall we blame? With this, I shall propose this kind of equation for impact, so far, where energy for impact equals to the mass of value times the enlightenment of the network. If the network sees value, the network enlightens itself, therefore the network supports the movement and therefore, energy is dispensed in favor of the movement.

Now, take aside the battles from the outside, it remains as a final reflection the battles with the inside; exactly because of the situation that a real listening comes from an alliance that has to start from the inside, exactly because of the premisse that the small unit listens first to their own voices. And exaclty because, as we have considred, the heroic movemnt, like the ethical movement, can be too loud, too strong; and even if we know, in theory, that a critic must chime in, that one critic from within can be seen in many situations as a villain. In other words, it are generally led to feel not comfortable with pulling out a critic out of the sudden, ourselves. And we might not know to activate one that is critic that does it in a inspiring way, a way that does not kill our own artists, our creative being. The final puzzle is then set for the map of impact. 

I will give you an idea of how I felt good and bad one day when I figured I had a dreamer inside myself. It was an interesting day which I had a major insight and wrote a letter to an investor. I were saying thanks to something he wrote before. I told him that in a given day I screamed — ah! it's that freaking party, the problem. That party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course.) The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow."

The response from investor recognized my heroic deviation in the face of the need for that broader perspective. He wrote asking me to keep doing the work of categorizing activities in clusters, and identifying these patterns, and considering the priorities. He added saying that "natural multi-taskers, with a strong work ethic, can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them." He added that this way of doing would cause a problem because of "the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time." 

I think that his message, and my own message were part of the key to solve the equation. We were talking about it, minimally, and I were starting to feel good and bad altogether about that uncomfortable place, sad or happy but better than to deny and be happy producting. This goes back to a key into solving the state that leaders must find to access the dimensions which Michael were concerned, the different pursuits. As we dig into, open the door, we shall then face a view of compassion in the first place, and then we map how that view may appear in the small situation and in the big situation.

Reid Hoffman recognizes a style of management, and for that he refers to the work of Fred Kofman [^footnote_conscious_business], of a compassionated view that transcends the individual needs and wants. The example he points uses the organization of an hospital to illustrate the point from the book of Fred, Conscious Business:  

[^footnote_conscious_business]: 

> *"Take for example doctors working on patients. And you say, 'this doctor is not doing the job well'. Well, when you get them out of the building, you are actually being hugely compassionate to patients."* (Hoffman, 2017, 50:14)

-->

Although this principle of management is illustrated as operational in an organization, for the startup that is not only a reminder for situations in the past but has a significance in terms of principles applicable at all times, especially going through stages of successes. One which essentially set us into the exercise, that asks us to transcend from the present views, and into allowing the view from the group, or the higher-order larger viewpoint. 



In other words, this principle may help us to keep ourselves open and to listen and to certain extent minimize the pain of releasing from our ties and assumptions in the face, in other words, facing a potential grief by considering the compassionate level to the other stakeholders or the audiences, you can call it customers, investors or the networks of support that you need to bring with your cause. In other words, the exercise is a less brutal way, taking us to avoid the denial, taking us to see value in the effort of seeking the perspectives of the many involved, the people that we'll need on our way. This is essentially about checking our views, not in retrospect from potential failures, and testing and probing with these external elements, but actually bringing up the conversation in proactive ways, which is in a way inevitably has a little bit to do with the idea of pre-mortem exercises or you may see this as a humble viewpoint, or a transcending viewpoint, or to be comfortable with releasing views, for the sake of understanding what happens.

@outline - Challenging starts from within, open to listen, the problem of dictatorship.

Now a problem yet remains open, especially in the setting of apparently growing startups where a lot of movement happens to be highly influenced by the leadership is strong. How come to see from different goggles? Thus even if knowing of a compassionate viewpoint needed, for others existing or other views for for the business in the future, requires a first movement, the self to listen, to be open, in the first place. The way that Michael Dearing set us to be open is by first making a point that our superpowers come with a price to pay: 

> *"Human beings have a knack for observing, forming judgments, and taking action. When you state it like this it seems pretty linear and rational, whether you’re talking about individuals or people working in teams. Cognitive behavior theory says automatic thoughts color and distort our observations, our judgments, and our actions."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

--> 

Which comes with a good news - especially for the moments when we believe we are static and responding with a formed identity - where Michael does see the leaders in us as able to change their goggles, which goes along with the supporting points from cognitive behavioral theory from Aaron Beck: 

> *"Beck’s theory of cognitive behavior described how observations, judgments, and actions are tinted and changed by automatic thoughts. These automatic thoughts come to mind without even trying. They reflect deep beliefs about self, past experiences, and expectations for the future, and they have a profound impact on judgment and behavior."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

I would tease you into that theme with the thinking that "if you are too fast doing it, consider how fast you are in assuming that you are what you are." But of course the power of superpowers will always set the hero to miss the perspective by its own style of movement. That because, they can be great, fast and slow. From a perspective, for now, it may be then uncomfortable - such as what we feel if we account one in a position of superpower to recognize a negative side, or a half-empty glass.

@outline - Example, supporting, afraid identity leader 
-->

As example of supporting views that can be created to the self, we may consider the power of support and the challenge of support. The insight from a research cited by *Are You Afraid to Identify as a Leader?* (2022), has shown how hard we can be influenced by our views, who we are, the identity we feel we must hold, and how weak all of that can be given that a special supportinng view sets a new perspective for these identities. I think that the exercice greatly reconciles some of our reflections as for our identities with our fears: 

> "In one study, we found that participants who listened to a podcast in which we framed leadership as risky were less likely to identify or act as leaders than those who listened to a podcast that described leadership as low-risk. This suggests that simply by presenting leadership as less risky and lower-stakes (for example, by clarifying that leadership mistakes are expected and will not be a black mark on an employee’s record), managers can help employees feel more comfortable seeing themselves as leaders." (Cunningham, Sonday, & Ashford, 2022)

--> 

In other words, it sounds quite scary that we can fear things after crafting our own identity as projected, tied, or pressured by the work situation, the startup situation. 

> *"At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Why would perceptions of riskiness influence something as deeply ingrained as your identity? From a psychological standpoint, however, this effect is not surprising at all. No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might think."* - (Cunningham, Sonday, & Ashford, 2022).

These considerations are not here to say that you can use your imagination to trick yourself. It's here provoking to us the fact that we might be as well using our own imagination already, setting our own paths in front of us in the first place, setting us to believe that we cannot change in the first place. The power by the simple experiment is good enough to show how powerful are our views. To conclude, in alighment with the compassionate view for our creating conditions for us to grow, we shall then celebrate an idea, which can well take us to be less uncomfortable and perhaps towards challenging our views more naturally. This is the view that ask us to be friends with the critic in ourselves. 



In the course of Harrison Metal, entitled General Management 2, Michael elaborates on principles for managing execution that takes in consideration that objectives can be both strong and weak. Strong in the sense of values, from the perspective of the objectives that gives motivation for movement, strong in the sense of the wider view that allows rooms for failure, for adaptation, for a conscious view for going from small and into growth. And weak, or better, humble, is the flexibility of evaluation that recognizes that the activities we pick, the key results we aim for, are at the same time closing a gap but also lifting ideas, understanding, evaluation, of the objective itself. 

If we seek a friendly critic, we shall consider a somewhat cold critic eye on top of the performers that may at times be able to experiment, to play too. The whole idea of this cold supervisor may be about to be calmer, as opposed to applauding the kids too quick all the time and making a parade for their movements. He gives the leg, the arm, supports. But he or she is cold, keeps her child informed about potential risks too. Keeps the team aware. Thus to enable a path of less frustration but also helps in structuring the episode with more rigor and less bet, like thinking it will work out. This model of strategizing says that there is an overarching meta control - as if it were a premeditated battle where the outcome, positive or negative, is always positive, an experiment. This parent, growth educator, and therapeut coach, is there to support curiosity and to let the team to be calm with a good critic. The valley, call it the throgh of sorrow or the valley of confusion, is valley of opportunity, is where life rises, is where the team can be enlightened. The path is the solution. 

Of course, especially for the case of writers but not limited, we should realize that intermediary conflict celebrate its existence as in respecting and noticing when that creative doer fights with our know-it-all critic. Indeed, these personalities are roles in the same room, especially in the beginning of professional journeys, where we engage in a fight and it looks like a struggle and it's a struggle that confuses us. The light, at the end of the tunnel, if we accept to see it, is an enlightened place where they can collaborate and as well said by Dorothea Brandy from *Becoming a Writer*. Dorothe Brand, in 1934, pulled that truth from her well, to tell yet-to-become writers about the peaceful place where these personalities do not have to attack each other in realtime. I think that this is applicable to the life of a writer, to the life of a developer writing code, to an individual going through projects and writing the narrative of their lives and their startups:  

> *"He has trained himself so that the physical effort of writing does not tire him out of all proportion to the effect he achieves. His intellect directs, criticizes, and discriminates whatever two possible courses present themselves in such a way as to leave the more sensitive elements of his nature free to bring forth its best fruit. He learns to use his intellect both cursively, as he works, and later, as he considers what he has done during the period of the creative flow. He replaces by conscious intention, and day by day, the drawings made on his fonts of images, sensations, and ideas by keeping awake to the observations. Ideally, the two sides of his nature are at peace with each other and work in harmony. At the least, he must be able to suppress one or other at discretion. Each side of his character must learn to be able to trust the other, to do what is in its field, and to carry the full responsibility for its own work. He restrains each side of his mind to its own functions, never allowing the conscious to usurp the privilege of the unconscious, and vice versa.*" Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)
