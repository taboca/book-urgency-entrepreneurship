--> 

Now if all or some of this makes a bit of sense we need to check using a modern case, a journey that started small and created impact to the world. For that I am using the iconic case of Airbnb, which is recognized [^footnote_blitzscaling_airbnb] by the Blitzscaling crew as a case that started with an idea and passed through the stages of growth. Like we did with the historical context of Harriet, we may first lock the world's forces, to consider that a world's potential 10x force were in the air, that the world wanted to push forward the sharing economy, which to the context of Airbnb had to do with enabling ways for people to stay in other people's houses; which weren't not invented but the modern world - of fears - may have created barriers for a while. With that, then the question goes back to the founder - to wonder if they are up to it? And like we did with Harriet, we may too help ourselves and, temporarily, assume that Airbnb's future was written, that Airbnb was to be the actual materialization of the modern experience about to happen to solve the problem of people staying at each other's homes. And like we did, we will go back to deconstruct that premise later. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_airbnb]: Airbnb and Brian's interview within the context of Blitzscaling is key, likely Airbnb and Brian's story had big impact in the construction of the Blitzscaling, likely through values. 

[^footnote_brian_earlyteam]: I am using the notion of Brian but just like we won't know what are the key elements inside one person, in the self, we won't know how much their characterization as a leader depends on others. With that, it is implied the role of his cofounder and friend, Joe Gebbia, and if we dig into that, we will certain find Brian's parents. The point here is that the word Brian is a good representation for the early stage exactly because of the strong and weak representation and the potential - a leader in the beginning can well just stop doing it and go back to do something else at any time. 

Now and focusing on the characterizations of Brian, or Brian's team [^footnote_brian_earlyteam] but let us use Brian for now, one is of the said *Infinite Learner*, and with that we can wonder how one learner learns in a way where they can scale and grow, from small wins and developing ties with the right networks of support. A quick reading from their situation, from far, brings me to wonder about luck. Brian was lucky. When questioned about learning, through the Blitzscaling interview, he said that to solve the problems ahead one needs to find the right source of knowledge, such as the right person in the network, but if accessing the right person is not possible, then there is the right book. He and Reid celebrated that *High Output Management* is one of these materials, and then they recognized too the moment, and the special person who had recommended the book to them.

Which brings us to honor an objection - to minimally notice that Brian were already next to Reid Hoffman, that Greylock had already invested in Airbnb, and that before all of that Brian's team had been accepted by YCombinator, and that YCombinator were already a top-tier accelerator in Silicon Valley, and that they were already recognized as a network of knowlege and a network for accessing top-tier investors. These are just a few observation that sets me to, again, not to be mad with the idea that all attempt of mapping lessons is pointless but to think that too many variables were in the air preventing a solid lesson to settle. 

But there are things to be taken from subtle givens, like the case of Harriet, that may well explain how Brian were able to go along with a) that world's 10x force and b) that destiny of Airbnb in the growth situation. In other worlds, Brian was not let go, through the stages of Blitzscaling. Which set us to wonder about characterizations, or the thing, which they had which enabled them to kept on building alliances with their support network, throughout the stages of growth. Two different moments of Airbnb, given by Brian, shows how his learning were both a learning and a movement of follow through that went along in syncronicity not only with what his grown up advisor roles were telling but actually enabling those advisors to learn with him. 

The first is a situation which Brian considered as one of the best advices, one which he got from Paul Graham that is also know as *Do Things that Don't Scale*: 

> *"Probably the most important single piece of advice I got, which is probably advice that is probably the most important advice I can give you, or one of the most important advice. He basically drew out this chart and he basically said, it's better to have 100 people that love you, 100 customers that love you, than a million customers that just sort of like you. In other words, if you have 100 people that absolutely love your product, they'll tell 100 people, and then they'll tell 100 people, or even 10 people, and this thing will grow. We call it growing virally. In fact, almost all movements in history have grown this way as well. There's like deeply passionate followers and they grow it. And they're customer advocates. And the problem is, in Silicon Valley, the general wisdom is, I need to build some app, this thing it needs to have this viral coefficient. I need to get millions of people to use it. And they gotta like it enough to share it. That's totally the wrong way to think about it, especially if you're in a service business like ours. So Paul Graham said, 'All you have to do is get 100 people to like you. Don't worry about millions of people.' That was totally freeing. 'Cause until then I was like, 'How the hell am I gonna get a million people to do this if I can't even get my mom or my sister to do it?' But I can find 100 people. And so we literally decided, do things that don't scale."* (Chesky, Brian., 2015, 22:13)

Now, if if you listen to how he says that, if you hear his voice, you will also feel that he had connected with the idea. He were free. They had given permission to do what they knew was right. Which brought them to focus on the right thing which one example picture is themselves as founders flying to New York to take better photos of apartments of their early hosts. They were not going there to take quick photos and come back. They were really listening to their hosts, they were living through empathy. They were celebrating life values that could be exposed all the way to the listing of apartments. I will tell you what this means. Once when visiting the profile of an apartment from the city of Sao Carlos in Brazil, I was scared to see a photo of the dirtiest kitchen ever as the cover photo. It took me two seconds to understand how these students were honest. When that early Airbnb team took that message, do things that don't scale, they took it in a way which perhaps even scared their advisors. They took it to the next level. Paul Graham were likely surprised by Brian's movement. Paul Graham grew and learned.

Just like Reid Hoffman who told us [^footnote_blitzscaling_reid_learning_with_brian] that he learned with Brian. This is building of a strong alliance. This is listening, which brings us to another given moment of Airbnb's history where, again, alliances were growing through values. At a point in Airbnb's history two brothers had decided to copy Airbnb idea, to do it better. And these two were good and already experts in doing that. They did it and the message was already clear and given to Brian. If they do with your idea, it is over. When Brian called his alliances to understand the situation amid the facts, the odds of a place they didn't know what to do, it appears again Paul Graham, which again gave to them an even better advice, "You are missionaries, they are mercenaries. You should basically just pretend like they had this baby, but they don't wanna raise the baby." And Brian had listened to that, and through that he again had understood values: 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_reid_learning_with_brian]: Marcio, pick the moment from the Blitzscalingn lecture where Reid honestly revels that he learned with Brian. 

> *"And so I thought, well we're founders. We wanna grow this company. So I'm like a parent and I want this child to grow into this wonderful company. And so I said... Well, I didn't say this to Oliver Samwer, but my view was, my biggest punishment, my biggest revenge on you is, I'm gonna make you run this company long term. So you had the baby, now you gotta raise the child. And you're stuck with it for 18 years. 'Cause I knew he wanted to sell the company, I'm like, "No, no. You're running this company." And I knew he maybe could move faster than me for a year, but he wasn't gonna keep doing it. And so that was our strategy. And we built company long term. And the ultimate way we won is, we had a better community. He couldn't understand community."* Brian (Greylock, 2015, 1:6:00)

So through values they kept on building their strongest value. And through their product they were able to let their community do that as well. In other words, the community were too growing with them. For me, a major lesson to be taken from the story of Harriet and the story of Brian has to do with the lessons being taken from the generals of the past and the advisors of Brian's day. And this, again, take us to deconstruct that premisse, of destiny: Is it that they were essentially following through or were these soldiers or the community charging themselves with creativity being unblocked by fears and launching themselves? Who shall we blame?

@outline - Marcio's goggles

When Marcio had insight and told Michael that the major problem was of a party, for what was nice, like flow. And not the denial to do the boring. So the doing the so good things led to use of energy in excess. Insigh of Marcio - "Thank you Michael. Your reply resonated so much with things in my head, concerns, sometimes not clear; it adds so much clarity. A few months ago, I had, virtually speaking, screamed — ah! It's that freaking party the problem. The party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course). The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow. "

Insight of Michael, not a public quote yet, that "Categorization --> clusters --> patterns --> priorities -- that's it exactly. Natural multi-taskers with a strong work ethic (that's what I hear in your opening above) can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them. That's a problem if you compound the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time. Thank you for the note. It's very helpful to see through your goggles."

Another aspect goes straight to the discovery of the next stage. As one is experimenting with ideas, thus of course it should be recognized hands on projects, still the entrepreneur is also openning herself to the validating the system to be in place for the world ahead which of course synchronizes with values but should not be lock in a form or another. This very approach to what is being done opens a reflective model of management for the startup which seeks to validate or "to recruit" allies which are resources that signal, or funds, larger experiments and at the same time the evaluation of the larger goal. 

The identified component of the playbook becomes the exercise of value, as it has its built in mechanism for objectives evaluation. In the course of Harrison Metal, entitled General Management 2, Michael elaborates on principles for managing execution that takes in consideration that objectives can be both strong and weak. Strong in the sense of values, from the perspective of the objectives that gives motivation for movement, strong in the sense of the wider view that allows rooms for failure, for adaptation, for a conscious view for going from small and into growth. And weak, or better, humble, is the flexibility of evaluation that recognizes that the activities we pick, the key results we aim for, are at the same time closing a gap but also lifting ideas, understanding, evaluation, of the objective itself. Thus, one in a mission for a startup is automatically one in a mission for new management which requires a humble component that accepts that the objective,or the larger objective, is being discovered.

Reid Hoffman recognizes a style of management, and for that he refers to the work of Fred Kofmann [^footnote_conscious_business], of a compassionated view that transcends the individual needs and wants. The example he points uses the organization of an hospital to illustrate the point from the book of Fred, Conscious Business:  

[^footnote_conscious_business]: 

> *"Take for example doctors working on patients. And you say, 'this doctor is not doing the job well'. Well, when you get them out of the building, you are actually being hugely compassionate to patients."* (Hoffman, 2017, 50:14)

-->

Although this principle of management is illustrated as operational in an organization, for the startup that is not only a reminder for situations in the past but has a significance in terms of principles applicable at all times, especially going through stages of successes. One which essentially set us into the exercise, that asks us to transcend from the present views, and into allowing the view from the group, or the higher-order larger viewpoint. 

In other words, the principle tell us to keep ourselves open, and embracing the compassionate level for the organization in development, in the future, which should set us to recognize present needs for adaptation which is different from forming conclusions in retrospect only after we are totally sure that something has gone wrong. The driver that only learns after analysis in retrospect - logically better than no analysis at all - looses the humble viewpoint that keeps her from the opportunity to see the road from above. 






<!--
@outline - Challenging starts from within, open to listen, the problem of dictatorship.

Now a problem yet remains open, especially in the setting of apparently growing startups where a lot of movement happens to be highly influenced by the leadership is strong. How come to see from different goggles? Thus even if knowing of a compassionate viewpoint needed, for others existing or other views for for the business in the future, requires a first movement, the self to listen, to be open, in the first place. The way that Michael Dearing set us to be open is by first making a point that our superpowers come with a price to pay: 

> *"Human beings have a knack for observing, forming judgments, and taking action. When you state it like this it seems pretty linear and rational, whether you’re talking about individuals or people working in teams. Cognitive behavior theory says automatic thoughts color and distort our observations, our judgments, and our actions."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

--> 

Which comes with a good news - especially for the moments when we believe we are static and responding with a formed identity - where Michael does see the leaders in us as able to change their goggles, which goes along with the supporting points from cognitive behavioral theory from Aaron Beck: 

> *"Beck’s theory of cognitive behavior described how observations, judgments, and actions are tinted and changed by automatic thoughts. These automatic thoughts come to mind without even trying. They reflect deep beliefs about self, past experiences, and expectations for the future, and they have a profound impact on judgment and behavior."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

I would tease you into that theme with the thinking that "if you are too fast doing it, consider how fast you are in assuming that you are what you are." But of course the power of superpowers will always set the hero to miss the perspective by its own style of movement. That because, they can be great, fast and slow. From a perspective, for now, it may be then uncomfortable - such as what we feel if we account one in a position of superpower to recognize a negative side, or a half-empty glass.

@outline - Example, supporting, afraid identity leader 
-->

As example of supporting views that can be created to the self, we may consider the power of support and the challenge of support. The insight from a research cited by *Are You Afraid to Identify as a Leader?* (2022), has shown how hard we can be influenced by our views, who we are, the identity we feel we must hold, and how weak all of that can be given that a special supportinng view sets a new perspective for these identities. I think that the exercice greatly reconciles some of our reflections as for our identities with our fears: 

> "In one study, we found that participants who listened to a podcast in which we framed leadership as risky were less likely to identify or act as leaders than those who listened to a podcast that described leadership as low-risk. This suggests that simply by presenting leadership as less risky and lower-stakes (for example, by clarifying that leadership mistakes are expected and will not be a black mark on an employee’s record), managers can help employees feel more comfortable seeing themselves as leaders." (Cunningham, Sonday, & Ashford, 2022)

--> 

In other words, it sounds quite scary that we can fear things after crafting our own identity as projected, tied, or pressured by the work situation, the startup situation. 

> *"At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Why would perceptions of riskiness influence something as deeply ingrained as your identity? From a psychological standpoint, however, this effect is not surprising at all. No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might think."* - (Cunningham, Sonday, & Ashford, 2022).

To conclude, in alighment with the compassionate view for our creating conditions for us to grow, we shall then celebrate an idea, which can well take us to be less uncomfortable and perhaps towards challenging our views more naturally. This is the view that ask us to be friends with the critic in ourselves. 

If we seek a friendly critic, we shall consider a somewhat cold critic eye on top of the performers that may at times be able to experiment, to play too. The whole idea of this cold supervisor may be about to be calmer, as opposed to applauding the kids too quick all the time and making a parade for their movements. He gives the leg, the arm, supports. But he or she is cold, keeps her child informed about potential risks too. Keeps the team aware. Thus to enable a path of less frustration but also helps in structuring the episode with more rigor and less bet, like thinking it will work out. This model of strategizing says that there is an overarching meta control - as if it were a premeditated battle where the outcome, positive or negative, is always positive, an experiment. This parent, growth educator, and therapeut coach, is there to support curiosity and to let the team to be calm with a good critic. The valley, call it the throgh of sorrow or the valley of confusion, is valley of opportunity, is where life rises, is where the team can be enlightened. The path is the solution. 

Of course, especially for the case of writers but not limited, we should realize that intermediary conflict celebrate its existence as in respecting and noticing when that creative doer fights with our know-it-all critic. Indeed, these personalities are roles in the same room, especially in the beginning of professional journeys, where we engage in a fight and it looks like a struggle and it's a struggle that confuses us. The light, at the end of the tunnel, if we accept to see it, is an enlightened place where they can collaborate and as well said by Dorothea Brandy from *Becoming a Writer*. Dorothe Brand, in 1934, pulled that truth from her well, to tell yet-to-become writers about the peaceful place where these personalities do not have to attack each other in realtime. I think that this is applicable to the life of a writer, to the life of a developer writing code, to an individual going through projects and writing the narrative of their lives and their startups:  

> *"He has trained himself so that the physical effort of writing does not tire him out of all proportion to the effect he achieves. His intellect directs, criticizes, and discriminates whatever two possible courses present themselves in such a way as to leave the more sensitive elements of his nature free to bring forth its best fruit. He learns to use his intellect both cursively, as he works, and later, as he considers what he has done during the period of the creative flow. He replaces by conscious intention, and day by day, the drawings made on his fonts of images, sensations, and ideas by keeping awake to the observations. Ideally, the two sides of his nature are at peace with each other and work in harmony. At the least, he must be able to suppress one or other at discretion. Each side of his character must learn to be able to trust the other, to do what is in its field, and to carry the full responsibility for its own work. He restrains each side of his mind to its own functions, never allowing the conscious to usurp the privilege of the unconscious, and vice versa.*" Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)
