Now, if we set ourselves into this entrepreneurial dilemma is too strong, or too challenging, we might use our time for a calmer reflection about leadership. For this one, I invite us to be conducted by Michael Dearing, and to consider his scaling lessons, which he took from history, from a hero of history, and documented by his remarkable lecture *Two Blasts from the Past* (2018). What we're going to see, going back to the past and then back to the future, comes from the first first blast, and insights about leadership and scale taken by Michael from the transformational journey of Araminta "Minty" Ross who became Harriet Tubman and known as *The Moses of her people*, during the days of the civil wars. (If you are curious about the other blast, don't worry; because Michael will ride along with us further down towards the end of our book.)

Now, because of the depth of values from her journey, a word must precede because we may feel unconfortable to take serious lessons from special moments of history and special life stories from heroes, which is the case by this remarkable life story. In a nutshell, her journey through scaling consisted of escaping in the enslaved condition, her *Minty* days, to become a notorious conductor of the *Underground Railroad* [^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad], essenting freeing enslaved people and more than that conducting them into being, living, and from being into becoming, being part of, working, thus helping them to not feel as strangers in a strange land (of freedom.) In other words, we know that these circumstances, of truly heroic passages, are complex. We know of the too many forces, or too many variables, and even the elements of luck. Special moments from history may too set us to, again, express our feelings by recognizing the hand of God. 

[^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad]: The Underground Railroad was a secret network of routes and safe houses used by enslaved African Americans to escape to free states and Canada with the help of abolitionists and allies. This clandestine effort was most active during the early to mid-19th century, leading up to the American Civil War. For more information, see Wikipedia contributors, "Underground Railroad," Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, last modified June 13, 2024, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad.

But these considerations can be turned into an enlightenment to support our learning as opposed to be reasons for confusing us and not taking lessons. I mean, let us consider the historical context as a 10x force throughout the period. As in, that on one hand, forces from the north supporting freedom and the end of slavery, and on the other hand the forces from the south supporting the situation as it were. In other words to consider the environment which we know as destiny. This environment setting now goes inline with the thoughts from Andy Grove about the 10x force, or external forces, or cooperation forces, which sets a challenge for the leader. From this view, we may ask: Is it possible for the one who is in an enslaved condition to escape? And if so, to commit to the movement of rescuing others? If we lock in, if we frame for a moment, that Harriet's movement didn't affect history, and that the end of slavery was certain then by removing complexities, assuming the force, we set the problem of scaling in the face of a force like that growth curve. In other words, is it possible for the one who follow through and to cause impact? 

This framing may be an attempt to oversimplification, although yet it would be what can be considered a very complex or perhaps impossible challenge, nevertheless a way for us to follow through, as in to wonder if it is possible for one to follow along and to scale and to cause impact, or to ride along with the curve.

Let us consider a picture from the middle of her story, "about ten years after she had really seized her own freedom," when she became a favorite secret agent for the North. Michael shows a letter, which she carried in her pocket, which meant free pass in terms of transport, ability to buy supplies, and more: 

> *"Pass the bearer, Harriet Tubman, to Beaufort and back to this place, and wherever she wishes to go; and give her free passage at all times, on all Government transports. Harriet was sent to me from Boston by Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, and is a valuable woman. She has permission, as a servant of the Government, to purchase such provisions from the Commissary as she may need."* (Bradford, 2018, p. XX).

The letter was signed by David Hunter, a Union general and represented one of many acts of trust and support to her mission as she were at this point building a strong network of information and gathering information. When I start with that picture, I certainly am skipping things, as in a nutshell, the prior moment where she were aware of herself from being an unnoticed, like a little grain in a shell, to becoming a pearl. Or, as Michael puts it properly, to be busy into the business of freeing people. But that again helps us to frame the question as a problem of scale. In other words, how come she ended up helping these generals? And before that, how come she became a conductor of the *Underground Railroad*? And doing so many missions of rescue, again and again, for about a decade before that. This frame in the middle shows that she had done something before, and something after which we will get there soon, which we may start by celebrating her first heroic movement saving herself. And then, doing a lot of missions, for about a decade, she saved about 70 people. 

In terms of the lessons, the scaling lessons, from Michael, the first observation consists of the idea of small wins which started with her own experience saving herself; of course connected with values. This took her to develop a playbook in terms of how to rescue people. Michael pointed out that "she took what she knew and she taught other people how to be good conductors on the road." In other words, she were crafting a playbook; in other words, she were making small batches of successes and she were iterating.

Now, another observation should observe network dynamics from her iterations and interactions. That in the face of values that were outstanding, a collaboration of *Underground Railroad* were happening also characterized by spots, like houses, where trust was required in order for collaboration to happen. If the network existed before Harriet, any supporter would likely ask - at the first encounter - if she were trustworthy. The more the network was being used the more their ties were forming, strong ties, essentially building the network. Michael reminds us that at a certain point Harriet was trusted with other people's resources and skills, that she was walking around with the equivalent of a year's salary of a senior officer. Nevertheless, our needless to say, it comes that such stronger trust network gave to her the opportunity to be trustworthy and to get involved with bolder ideas, or projects, which in normal circumstances could be seen as crazy or unrealistic. This took her, through these growth interactions, into the situation which Michael pointed as network equivalent to an army. This is about the meaning of iterating the playbook by doing it and by passing on the playbook at the same time.

Now, a moment of reflection is especially necessary if we visit a special moment which can be seen as a climax in her hero's journey, when she got involved as a leader who, together with an army, got involved in the rescue or more than 700 enslaved people from plantations, in a given night, using boats. So now I ask ourselves, wonder what is smaller or bigger from her context throughout these stages: Is this day more important than the day when she rescued herself? Or are any of these days more important than when she decided to come back for the first time? For me, I think the most challenging moment would be the day where she faced her fears and went back for the first time. But maybe for her it wasn't. You can pick yours. But the point is that throughout these steps or stages, or challenges, you name it, she had to face releasing herself from a certain comfort zone. She certain had her own specific reasons for so but nevertheless she did it, certainly throughout her movements which involved her awareness that she knew she could die. Here are we bring about the idea of a loss, or of a potential death, which may be alive in the life of a doer. We should celebrate her own observation as documented: 

> *"I had reasoned this out in my mind; there was one of two things I had a right to, liberty, or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other; for no man should take me alive; I should fight for my liberty as long as my strength lasted, and when the time came for me to go, the Lord would let them take me."* Harriet Tubman to Sarah Bradford (2018)

So this brings us to more precisely consider the role of values, which Michael had acknowledged and identified in the very beginning of this lecture but nevertheless I am stating here as it is present throughout the stages. In other words, her movements may set us to consider the applicability of her values in ways that could actually work across the various stages. Values that took her into freedom, and then driving her movement into other efforts, to rescue others, and then values that were given to others, either inspiring them or mobilizing them, people that she met on the way. This consideration brings us to unlock something that we locked before, which help us with the whole quation, that the actual movements carried on by Harriet were essentially influencing the whole network. In other words, we may wonder if the strongest of all generals needed her values - through actions - so that they could also pass that inflection point themselves, in the face of them being freaked out by the possibility of failure. Therefore, to hear Harriet's voice, her values, they may have armored themselves with what they needed to commit. In other words, Harriet gave them reasons to commit.

To illustrate this puzzle, we may dive within a specific moment in time when the situation had gotten harder, where the distance in terms of the rescue trip went from 90 miles to 500 miles after the *Fugitive Slave Act of 1850* pushed them to find another safe base outside US, Canada. Now, having us removed that destiny situation, and keeping at the same, we have the chicken and the egg problem set and the idea that Harriet were up to the challenge and also that Harriet took them to the next level. And the fair or settlinng reflection that she, by conducting herself by getting things done and through values, were essentially mobiling a tremendous amout of people to believe, first, and from that to move, and to creativelly move to help. They were essentially using values to build a "product," together, a tool, a technology, call it whatever the heck you like.

Now, towards settling a reflection about values, and how to scale through values in the context of startups, we should come back to noticing that we don't have a clear picture of these values or we don't have the exact precise insight about the ways to conduct these values and how to take the most of it by these iterations and interactions. This is exactly the reason for us to use time to this matter, as in work time, and to reflect about our passions and visions and values throughout the stages and about our actions and behaviors to achieve clarity. 

One way to look at this is to consider that through these iterations and interactions and by the exercises where it doesn't matter through prototypes or articles or narratives and actions but it matters that we if we do so in ways that the values are being carried over we're also doing so in ways that we are collaborating with external supporters of our causes and they are giving us the signs and the advices and feedback and being excited and perhaps even mobilized to help the cause together so certainly this is where through values we set ourselves open to understand the creative ways in which the scaled or the bigger impact version might happen. Therefore, in other words, the value analysis that we should do consists of balancing out our very values against the different stakeholder groups on against these networks or alliances. And through values is one of the best ways to avoid the traps of immediate needs from these networks. Likely because all these other networks are also struggling by the very same pressures that we are struggling of the accelerated world. As an example, if you stumble in an investor and you don't talk about values and underlying values, you may well find yourself in front of an investor that is interested in immediate needs. For instance, a willingness to capitalize and then exit from the boat, which may not be the right early stage investor that you really want, because what you really want.

@meta @todo 
* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Impact vs. Identity - The work "Are you afraid of identitying yourself as a leader" could be brought into identity but it seems that it fails to pass the very point of the chapter, that our identities aren't about that willingness to identity as a leader. So then could this be brought into Impact just to make a point of how we can reframe our views?
