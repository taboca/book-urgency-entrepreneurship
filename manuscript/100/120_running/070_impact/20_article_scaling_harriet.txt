Now, in our path to understand or solve this entrepreneurial dilemma, and understand the transformation required from leadership which enables their startups to scale along with the curve, we're going to be conducted by Michael Dearing, and scaling lessons he took from a hero of history, which you can enjoy in a much enlightening format if you enjoy the first blast from his *Two Blasts from the Past* (2018) lecture. 

Now, as we take this quick travel back to the past and then back to the future, following insights drew by Michael, a few words must be considered. This is so because we may feel unconfortable to actually take lessons from special moments of history - in this case the days before the Civil War - and special life stories of success - in this case the remarkable life story of Araminta Ross, Minty when she were enslaved, and her path towards freedom becoming Harriet Tubman then becoming a notorious conductor of the *Underground Railroad* then helping ex-slaves, conducting them into being and into becoming not feeling as strangers in the new and strange land of freedom. In other words, we know something about circumstances, like truly heroic passages, we know that these movements are complex, we know of the too many forces, the too many variables, and elements of luck or coincidences. Special moments may too set some of us to, again, express our feelings by recognizing the hand of God. 

And it is not really that we don't believe that dots can be brought from history. But it may be so that we get distracted by the condensed version, exactly not able to see the actual too many variables, and forces. As an example, we should consider a 10x force in that period - the forces from the North - forces supporting freedom and end of slavery - and on the other hand the forces from the South - forces supporting the situation as it were. Harriet were living through that historical inflection point. If we think from the perspective which we reflected from Andy Grove, the 10x forces, the external forces, we may too ask: Is it possible that one who is enslaved to escape and then commit to the movements of a higher order happening? If we lock in, if we frame for a moment, that Harriet's movement didn't affect history, as in that the end of slavery and the Civil War was a done deal ahead, we could then start to remove some of these complexities, make a bit more simple but still setting a major complex problem for Harriet - how to be following through, and following along, in synchronicity with the movement, quite a hard challenge anyway. 






<!-- outline - situation middle of it, connections --> 

Let us start  by considering her role, and her connections, by going straight to a period "about ten years after she had really seized her own freedom," when she became a favorite secret agent for the North. Michael points to a letter, which she carried in her pocket, which meant free pass in terms of transport, ability to buy supplies, and more. The letter was signed by David Hunter, a Union general and represented one of many acts of trust and support to her mission as she were at this point building a strong network of information and gathering information: 

> *"Pass the bearer, Harriet Tubman, to Beaufort and back to this place, and wherever she wishes to go; and give her free passage at all times, on all Government transports. Harriet was sent to me from Boston by Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, and is a valuable woman. She has permission, as a servant of the Government, to purchase such provisions from the Commissary as she may need."* (Bradford, 2018, p. XX).

 for about 15-20 years at this
11:11
time the business of freeing people and
11:13
in the sum total of her career she had
11:17
freed personally about 70 or 80 people



I wanted to start from that moment, from that picture, instead of running into my oversimplification in a nutshell that she were the bearer of herself from being unoticed like a little grain in a shell into becoming a pearl or as Michael puts much better that she were into "the business of freeing people" or as people saw her as *Moses of Her People*. Picturing that letter, instead, takes me to frame a question which brings me back to the scaling problem: How come she end up helping these generals? And before that, how come she became a conductor of the *Underground Railroad* [^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad] doing many missions of rescue, again and again, for about a decade before that?

[^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad]: The Underground Railroad was a secret network of routes and safe houses used by enslaved African Americans to escape to free states and Canada with the help of abolitionists and allies. This clandestine effort was most active during the early to mid-19th century, leading up to the American Civil War.

Whatever she did, as Michael shows, the big thing she were doing was to move along, which from the whole movement can be thought as starting with small wins. First, saving herself, check. Second, saving about 70 people through many individual rescue missions, check. Leading an army to rescue 10x people in a day, check. Certain, although not easy, necessary to see from far the impossible. She were onto something, onto reading and writing that underground network playbook. From that initial win, a big win from first person, to finding allies and her way to do it again - which Michael sees as the movement of quick wins and building trust. Moving forward, these "small" wins were not only giving her a view of the playbook which went along that she were building a strong network. Michael pointed out that "she took what she knew and she taught other people how to be good conductors on the road," which meant she were crafting a play book. The outcome was that she were making small batches of sucesses, she were iterating. When bigger, the first step again which now turns her self energy and her values translated as other people's energy, people who shared the same values. Michael reminds us that Harriet was trusted with other people's resources and skills, that she were walking aroung with the equivalent of a year's salary of a senior officer. With that stronger trust network, she could approach supporters now with bolder ideas which in normal circumstances could be seen as crazy and unrealistic. Through the growth iteratins, "her networks became quite literally armies." And she kept on iterating the playbook, in other words, passing on the playbook.

Now we might reflect about the climax of her story, if we wanted to see from a condensed view in a nutshell. It could be that moment when she leads the army they all rescue more than 700 enslaved people from plantations using boats. Or would it be the day she rescued herself? Or the day which she decided to go back the first time. I rather think the most difficult moment was the first thought of going back after escaping. You can pick yours. But the point is that through all of these steps, she had to also face releasing herself from the comfort zone. Through all her movements, she knew, she could die. And when she asked herself, she knew the answer, I rather live (along with the idea of freedom) or die: 

> *"I had reasoned this out in my mind; there was one of two things I had a right to, liberty, or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other; for no man should take me alive; I should fight for my liberty as long as my strength lasted, and when the time came for me to go, the Lord would let them take me."* Harriet Tubman to Sarah Bradford (2018)

Which bring us to the element of values, which Michael had identified as key to the beginning, but the one which kept her swimming across, again and again. The values of freedom took her to take herself into freedom. The value of freedom took her to take more of her people. These were the same values which were given to others she met on her way. They heard what she were saying. Even the strongest of all generals likely freaked out but to hear Harriet's voice, through values, they might have too entered the zone of commitment, for example in front of feelings of weakness. To point a situation when things gotten hard, the distance her rescure and initial trips were of about 90 miles; while after the *Fugitive Slave Act of 1850*, their new safe base in Canada increase the distance to 500 miles. With that, I would then go back to my point, the frame, where I locked the truth that end of slavery was certain which allowed us to think of Harriet moving along, following along. Now, in peace, andl looking back to history, we may then wonder - how many of the generals or soldiers and all sorts of people fighting she actually moved, and moved their beliefs? Were she able to give them a view that she had? And the settlinng reflection that she, conducting hersel by getting things done and through values were essentially involving a tremendous amout of people to believe, first, and from that to move, and to creativelly move to help. They were essentially using values to build a product together, a tool, a technology, you call it whatever the hell you like.

Now, for startups, that part of values can be tricky. The identification of values shows a good startint point for founders. Exactly because in many endeavours that people get into, they might right there have not a clear picture of values. Thus, it becomes vital for any entrepreneur to use time in this regard - work time. And it is not that founders's envisioned project don't have values - a lot of projects created with passion, and vision, actually connect with strong values. It is just that the energy to make the project real sometimes, can hide values that could also improve the founder's chances towards freeing themselves. When lacking values analysis, they can lock themselves and even bring premature ends to what they do. The search for values is then a great exercise that opens the realm of possibilities beyond one or another current project, experiment or activity that is being undertaken.

    @outline - Fear that comes with the new condition? I am up to it? This may connect with the point of finding support from Michael.

@meta @todo 
* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Impact vs. Identity - The work "Are you afraid of identitying yourself as a leader" could be brought into identity but it seems that it fails to pass the very point of the chapter, that our identities aren't about that willingness to identity as a leader. So then could this be brought into Impact just to make a point of how we can reframe our views?
