Now, in our path to understand or solve this entrepreneurial dilemma, and understand the transformation required from leadership which enables their startups to scale along with the curve, we're going to be conducted by Michael Dearing, and scaling lessons he took from a hero of history, which you can enjoy in a much enlightening format if you enjoy the first blast from his *Two Blasts from the Past* (2018) lecture. 

Now, as we take this quick travel back to the past and then back to the future, following insights drew by Michael, a few words must be considered. This is so because we may feel unconfortable to actually take lessons from special moments of history - in this case the days before the Civil War - and special life stories of success - in this case the remarkable life story of Araminta Ross, Minty when she were enslaved, and her path towards freedom becoming Harriet Tubman then becoming a notorious conductor of the *Underground Railroad* then rescuing enslaved people, conducting them into being and into becoming not feeling as strangers in the new and strange land of freedom. In other words, we know something about circumstances, like truly heroic passages, we know that these movements are complex, we know of the too many forces, the too many variables, and elements of luck or coincidences. Special moments may too set some of us to, again, express our feelings by recognizing the hand of God. 

Exactly because of these too many forces, we might as well recognize from the historical context the 10x force through that period, where one one hand forces from the North - forces supporting freedom and end of slavery - and on the other hand the forces from the South - forces supporting the situation as it were. This environmental setting may go well with the view from Andy Grove, setting these 10x forces or external forces or cooperation forces as the setting that creates the challenge for us. From this view, we may ask: Is it possible that one who is enslaved to escape? And if so, then commit to movement of a higher order such as to rescue others? If we lock in, if we frame for a moment, that Harriet's movement didn't affect history, that the end of slavery was certain then it would be possible to make things more simple for us, to remove complexities by assuming the force. It makes a bit more simple but still sets in a complex challenge which may help us to follow through - is it possible for one to follow along and to scale and to reach out to higher impact?

Let us consider a picture from the middle of her story, "about ten years after she had really seized her own freedom," when she became a favorite secret agent for the North. Michael shows a letter, which she carried in her pocket, which meant free pass in terms of transport, ability to buy supplies, and more: 

> *"Pass the bearer, Harriet Tubman, to Beaufort and back to this place, and wherever she wishes to go; and give her free passage at all times, on all Government transports. Harriet was sent to me from Boston by Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, and is a valuable woman. She has permission, as a servant of the Government, to purchase such provisions from the Commissary as she may need."* (Bradford, 2018, p. XX).

The letter was signed by David Hunter, a Union general and represented one of many acts of trust and support to her mission as she were at this point building a strong network of information and gathering information. When we start from that picture - instead of running into my oversimplification in a nutshell that she were the bearer of herself from being unoticed like a little grain in a shell into becoming a pearl or as Michael puts much better that she were into "the business of freeing people" or as people saw her as *Moses of Her People* - we can be kept in the framed question of the scaling problem: How come she end up helping these generals? And before that, how come she became a conductor of the *Underground Railroad* [^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad] doing many missions of rescue, again and again, for about a decade before that?

[^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad]: The Underground Railroad was a secret network of routes and safe houses used by enslaved African Americans to escape to free states and Canada with the help of abolitionists and allies. This clandestine effort was most active during the early to mid-19th century, leading up to the American Civil War.

Whatever she did, as Michael shows, the bigger thing she were doing had to do with growing with the movement. Saving herself, check. Second, saving about 70 people through many individual rescue missions, check. Leading an army to rescue 10x people in a given day, check. But when zooming in, at the moments, from that initial win, a big win from first person, to finding allies and her way to do it again - which Michael sees as the movement of quick wins and building trust. Moving forward, these "small" wins were not only giving her a view of the playbook which went along that she were building a strong network. Michael pointed out that "she took what she knew and she taught other people how to be good conductors on the road," which meant she were crafting a play book. The outcome was that she were making small batches of sucesses, she were iterating. When bigger, the first step again which now turns her self energy and her values translated as other people's energy, people who shared the same values. Michael reminds us that Harriet was trusted with other people's resources and skills, that she were walking aroung with the equivalent of a year's salary of a senior officer. With that stronger trust network, she could approach supporters now with bolder ideas which in normal circumstances could be seen as crazy and unrealistic. Through the growth iteratins, "her networks became quite literally armies." And she kept on iterating the playbook, in other words, passing on the playbook.

Now, a word of reflection is necessary for a special moment which one in a hurry could take as the climax of her hero's journey. That could be when she lead an army and they rescued more than 700 enslaved people from plantations, using boats. But wait, what is small or bigger from her living the present situations? This day or that very day when she rescued herself? Or the day which she decided to go back the first time. For me, I choose the the day when whe faced the fears and went back for the first time. You can pick yours. But the point is that through all of these steps, she had to also face releasing herself from the comfort zone. Through all her movements, she knew, she could die. And when she asked herself, she knew the answer, I rather live (along with the idea of freedom) or die: 

> *"I had reasoned this out in my mind; there was one of two things I had a right to, liberty, or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other; for no man should take me alive; I should fight for my liberty as long as my strength lasted, and when the time came for me to go, the Lord would let them take me."* Harriet Tubman to Sarah Bradford (2018)

Which bring us to the element of values, which Michael had identified as key to the beginning, but the one key things which necessarity has to appear across the stages, again and again. In other words, we may reason about the applicability of values across. The values which took her into freedom, driving her movement herself into freedom. The value from freedom which took her to rescue more, her people. And then, these were the same values which were given to others, to new people which she met on the way. They heard what she were saying. Even the strongest of all generals needed her, as through that inflection point and chaos they would too be freaked out of fears. But to hear Harriet's voice, her values, they had armed themselves with what they needed to commit. To point a situation when things gotten hard, the distance her rescure and initial trips were of about 90 miles; while after the *Fugitive Slave Act of 1850*, their new safe base in Canada increase the distance to 500 miles. With that, I would then go back to my point, the frame, where I locked the truth that end of slavery was certain which allowed us to think of Harriet moving along, following along. Now, in peace, andl looking back to history, we may then wonder - how many of the generals or soldiers and all sorts of people fighting she actually moved, and moved their beliefs? Were she able to give them a view that she had? And the settlinng reflection that she, conducting hersel by getting things done and through values were essentially involving a tremendous amout of people to believe, first, and from that to move, and to creativelly move to help. They were essentially using values to build a product together, a tool, a technology, you call it whatever the hell you like.

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Impact - Check Michael's GM2 objective definition with Harriet's model - Harriet's objective, although not clear from the beginning, goes inline with Michael's GM2 definition of what what is an objective: consistent with your values, reflects your first principles, world-view, generates pride, sense of accomplishment.

Now, for startups, that part of values can be tricky. The identification of values shows a good startint point for founders. Exactly because in many endeavours that people get into, they might right there have not a clear picture of values. Thus, it becomes vital for any entrepreneur to use time in this regard - work time. And it is not that founders's envisioned project don't have values - a lot of projects created with passion, and vision, actually connect with strong values. 


It is just, or actually in fact it's not even just, but it is the case that the energy that some of us sometimes put in something may actually hide us or prevent us from using the energy of checking values against these other dimensions that Michael Dearing had considered - the different pursuits in order to be in and out from the idea, in and out from the problem, in and out from the product, and into the bigger impact. Therefore, in other words, the value analysis that we should do consists of balancing out our very values against the different stakeholder groups on against these networks or alliances. And through values is one of the best ways to avoid the traps of immediate needs from these networks. Likely because all these other networks are also struggling by the very same pressures that we are struggling of the accelerated world. As an example, if you stumble in an investor and you don't talk about values and underlying values, you may well find yourself in front of an investor that is interested in immediate needs. For instance, a willingness to capitalize and then exit from the boat, which may not be the right early stage investor that you really want, because what you really want.

* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Impact vs. Identity - The work "Are you afraid of identitying yourself as a leader" could be brought into identity but it seems that it fails to pass the very point of the chapter, that our identities aren't about that willingness to identity as a leader. So then could this be brought into Impact just to make a point of how we can reframe our views?
