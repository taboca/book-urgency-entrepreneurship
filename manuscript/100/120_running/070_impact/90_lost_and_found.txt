#### Identity and violence 




Now if I were in fact forming an identity - such as of an AI writer-master - I can't say and it would be again an attempt to go too far. But I would say that the awakening - the call from that great writer - was enough to let me get away from that idea of an identity as a value, or to get away from a status that had a strong dependence with that tool. The liberation from that potential position brought me back to just be okay with myself being the whole Marcio which is more useful to a book than an specific Marcio. To detach myself from that identity or personality or character- you name it - it felt like I had supported myself to be back to my own whole self which may go along with the thinking of Amarthya Sen in Identity and Violence: 

> *"In our normal lives, we see ourselves as members of a variety of groups - we belong to all of them. A person's citizenship, residence, geographic origin, gender, class, politics, profession, employment, food habits, sports interestsm taste in music, social commitments, etc., make us members of a variety of groups. Each of these collectivities, to all of which this person simultaneously belongs, gives her a particular identity. None of them can be taken to be the person's only identity or singular membership category."* (Sen, 2006, p.2)

Some individuals, through projects in the corporate setting, are likely expressing an identity which is not a reflection of their true self of the present. The expression comes as they perform, as they see themselves as conductors for certain causes - it could be a key result ahead of a major objective. This expression might come in various ways as they see themselves in a role, or as supporters of a cause, such as a cause of other supporters, advocates, leaders, mentors, investors, angels, you name it. Naturally, the sky is the limit. From a storytelling perspective, a doer in a cause can be seen as a protagonist, or a messenger, or a conductor. Although what they do involves a set of specialized actions and behaviors, like when one is in control of how they act, the performer displays and develop behaviors that at the same time express and shape their identities.  

Framing from a storytelling perspective will helps us to understand how emotions, such as feelings of loss, are experienced quite strong to a point of governing decisions - thus the use of our scarce resources. The book Storynomics (2018), whose audience is marketers interested in improving their communications, shows how people's perception about things can influence decisions. The authors refer to a selection of scientific works that shows that people's perceptions about pain (or pleasure) are felt based on what is presented to them - as in narrated - influencing them from how they imagine the given narrative. The selection of studies presented (2018, p.43) does justice to this idea by supporting scientific evidence for what the world of advertising has long before cracked, and profited for a while [^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics], althought generally understood as a subject of persuasion.

[^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics]: 

Now the fact that the advertising "of the west world" has discovered - by measuring results with customers - reveals that people decide based on narratives and stories that they are told and listen. In other words, it matters a lot - minimally for advertising agencies as we can confirm - that in the end of the day people bring to their lives, that they decide, based on what they listen, no matter if the the stories told are seen as persuasive forms of communication, or emotional communication, rhetoric, and on and on. Or, from another perspective, the advertising of the west didn't invent, indeed, as they had more like discovered, or understood, the natural mechanism of how people decide from the perspectives from the narratives that they are told. In part three, we will explore further the subject of human communication as narration [^footnote_prelude_human_narration] but for now we will maintain the equilibrium by focusing on how fear drives us, or how fears enter our narrative that drive us. 

[^footnote_prelude_human_narration]: The work of Walter Fisher, Human Communication as Narration, will support us to improve our awareness of how people reason and decise based on the the experiences that they tell and listen. 

But if what is told makes people fear is only does so effectively in the face of an ongoing conversaion, an ongoing train that is moving. We recognize this train of thought if we imagine a team of people in a locomotive where the destination is a city but out of the sudden the train stops right before a bridge. In this situation, if someone says that they might have stopped to appreciate the view, some people might laugh or be mad with the realization of the irony or how the observation does not fit the reality of what is happening. Thus the storied context makes the possibility for what is told to be coherent or not, to be truthful or not. Thus in the tracks of our work projects, such as an entrepreneurial effort, w happens is that things go awry, or appears to be going in the bad direction, exactly as we want things to go in a certain direction, such as to stop by a key result associated with a higher-order objective or destination. All sort of situations that trigger fears such as the consideration that projects are going to be abruptly terminated, such as that layoffs as necessary, or if an entire division needs to be closed. And how certain things are triggered to our lives appears in different ways, because one may feel compassion for the people who could be affected, or when a leader feels in a position of being a messenger for a cause, a train conductor, you name it. Just as a train conductor is happy when the train is running smoothly and feels bad when it's no longer operational, the context of entrepreneurship and businesses also means a track of possibilities where the performers are protagonists who cares more than being apatic participants in a train moving to a random place. We aren't moving to an arbitrary place and we are not apatic participants. We are moving towards aspiring goals and we are humans. 

Thus the work situation, and especially the entrepreneurial situation, creates a storied context where certain values are established and helps to create an equilibrium. These values can be acessed if we dig into reflecting within actionable ideas like "we need to keep working in this project tonight" which might be associated with expectations of significant milestones, such as expected state of happiness of the team, expected state of security to the team or the project, or any measure of success that is ahead. Thus it's natural for a person's identity to be linked as a responsible being, as a protagonist, emotionally and ethically connected to a duty. Conversely, it is natural to expect that a failure to do so, to operate towards the success, might trigger an actual real impact to their lives, like the unsolvency of their ability to work, which triggers other fears as, for example, people may need to work for money or other reason they hold as value. Suddenly, due to various factors, external or internal, experienced or perceived, the protagonists find themselves crafting narratives that are powerful in the face of the experience of fears they project. 




#### The romantic 

An experienced and professional writer has written to me, in replying after what I have wrote to her, and she went direct to a point of pain: Marcio, do not make a dance or a song about something that is simple. She has asked me to go for the problem, to consider that the problem is simple. For the matter of working. I never thought that working was simple - which is an old idea I carry on, a sort of governing principle, a sort of operating model, influencing and always, how I engage with writing and other activities. 

Perhaps because of fears, perhaps because the idea of a judgement, related to the many aspects involved that I could be judged, such as grammar, typos, what I today think as of dislexia, a lot. All of these elements are like fireworks, not necessarily bringing the visual excitement but in the sense of a bombastic incident that always come my way, informing, signaling, of my fears, of my sense of protection, and even a projected sense of identity. 

In other words, I think, or feel, that I am not a person to write. Then, an almost rage comes my way, it would almost bring myself to be mad, but why would I do that? Actually, perhaps, it is a human trait to either go mad or go to other direction when the matter has to do with not engaging. 

I perhaps was the case that I had prior moments of frustrations, when older or elderly folks have called my attention about my mistakes. But over time, I didn't show those. Then, perhaps, I figured that I could move towards another space, another place, to be somebody in another setting. Thus, it appears that the human can specialize in their need to be somebody, to be effective or efficient, somewhere. 

( After note, when typing - I just remembered some of the ideas I have read from Adam Grant, from Originals, where he wrote that the brothers have a tendency to differentiate themselves. Such as the younger, that is generally taken as the one that is not going to be successful; he adds that yes he goes different, like a rebel, but he can also do really well when he goes for success. )

So we can come back to the case where the professional author advice seemed to touch a pain point in me - what was going on with Marcio - the act or attempt to make a song or engaging in a sort of dance. And even seeking joy.  

#### Am I looking to put fun? Or is just about the being of somebody or really about finding stories or creative way to help ourselves? 

The detours to enhance a boring, or calm, work, with a set of animation seems to be quite possible. I wonder the actual origin of that idea, and also the complexities, how far one can do that. And also, it should be accounted, I wonder about the positive effects of the hyper investment in the detours or the whole tour. 



#### The tour off duty 

The notion could be expanded as the tour off duty. When one entirely denies, and anchor himself in a new track. It might take to interesting places, undeniable. Of course, why not, right? Now, I am motivated, having fun, feeling energetic, no boundaries can come up with many sub tours as possible. 

Now, within the realm of the off tour, I am quite free, or arbitrary, mostly selecting what I want to do based on what captivates me. How far would that go and also how effective could that be for the actual goal? Like a planned wider, or long-term goal. Yes, some credible creations might happen, in the middle of all, but are these credible creations works that one could count on, involving progress? And the nature, regarding the nature of these works, when these projects become complex, would the protagonist be able to go through the ups and downs, like with perseverance? 

Or, again, would that be a pattern that repeats with the storied context, as the narrative of the project unfolds? It appears that the act of progressing for any project may actually be about writing upfront some goal, being able to select activities that pulls the goal closer, closes the gap, allowing room for precise work, for some aspiring work (check the balance) and be okay when the project ends with no perfect results achieved. Results, therefore, aren't the most important. 



#### Dancing with the AI writer robot 

When I had explored the affairs between us and tools - trying to explore if any identity could be formed from interacting with tools - I wasn't 100% into the direct and indirect potential effects from the simple situation when the human is acquainted with a tool. Think about what comes - as a bonus - if we take a time machine and witness a father making a hammer to his kid in the late 1700s. And then, let us move forward to another father passing on Smith & Wesson pistol to his kid in the late 1800s. Or yet in the late 1800s another kid gets a Remington No. 1 typewriter. And then another kid gets an Apple II computer in the late 1900s. Likely nothing much comes as a bonus. These are tools that can do nothing. These fathers, on the other hand, had told them what to do with the tools. And have likely guided them a bit not only in terms of how to use but they too have illustrated to them, have given to them, some narratives as for what to do with these tools and who they could become. These narratives were part of the process, the guidance, the manual. Now we are in a world where a lot of tools exist but also the guidance part gets to be communicated in new ways. In other words, as we have considered, tools are telling us how to do and who we can become. 

Setting our time machine to my own story not so long ago, we will witness how I turned out to become skilled with a tool and how I had achieved success that may have influenced my actions and perspectives as a writer. Somehow I got motivated about my developments with a tool, I saw myself as one that is skilled with this tool, right when I was facing the struggles of the development of my career as a writer, which I believe might be one of my identities by now. These were the days when I happened to meet this tool, this artificial intelligence tool entitled Chaffee PT made by OpenAI. I first found it fascinating that I could ask the tool to write. After I had put some bits and pieces of logic and asked it to produce an article, I was fascinated even more, especially given that I had suggested a logic for the structure as for how their story then goes. I caught myself ordering it to do things and having fun as well, like, no, that's not what I have asked of you, I want you to use a more scientific tone and less marketing orientation. I want you to use a plain and simple English, like the kind of English that William Zinsser would accept as interesting. And then I have given further instructions for the logic of my articles as well, like reminding the tool of how important it is to show a problem, to bring up a complication in the beginning as part of the introductions of the articles, and a lot more. The tool did an amazing job, even to a point of making me work a lot more than I would normally do. I'm especially proud that the artificial intelligence tool made me work.

So then I was able to also publish a couple in an online publication and even received a promotion. It should be noted that this promotion was a badge, a recognition. To defend myself, I wasn't cheating; and I had developed an extensive interaction and kept the control for all the words it had produced either by asking it to edit to the level of paragraphs and then editing myself the final paragraphs. Anyway the point is that the tool had led me to write better articles - where I didn't need anything else to support the view of myself becoming a better writer - but the result from using it had given to me support to that too, through the badge of being a contributor to that publication. 

But then, I might have brought myself to find some trouble from that too. I was, out of the sudden and likely after having given that "raise" or "promotion", passionated or feeling proud of myself. I had considered who I were and then I felt like being a sort of composer, being able to tell the robot to engage in many specific activities. And then I felt too that I was getting better in the art and science of controlling that robot. Moreover, I may have evolved into the movement I also caught myself struggling, and being a bit confused, or to be working for the robot too, or being influenced by the interactions that it had created. Through my interactions, yet when I was yet promoting the robot's amazing work and being proud of my ability to control it,  I happened to share thoughts about my discoveries with a great professional writer. At some point, she told me to "not make a dance or song about a simple activity." She didn't like how I was focusing in explaining to her about how I happened to be using the tool asking the tool to do things for me. She has told me to "think it through," and she reminded me that my brain was tool. That was an inflection point for me, an awakening. 

For me writing wasn't simple. But as I provoked her to point that I was becoming a sort of master of a an AI writing tool, she too provoked me by saying that the writing were simple. For me, a couple lessons followed: One, that I have left the position or the consideration to think of myself as someone like a master of a tool. In other words, I took myself out from the trap of thinking that I were a champion by being able to have full control over the tool. After having liberated myself from that notion, I then realized that was  essentially getting used, or lost, of confused, by the communication interactions with the tool. In other words, as my trust created a perspective of being a master, I was taking myself to be controlled by the tool and to be stuck into that perspective, not being able to release myself from it such as to be able to write and to see writing a simple activity. 







#### Stay hungry 

As for the final illustration of this chapter, I want to go back to the situation of us and tools - or us versus tools under the new terms - or the situation where we can be enamorated with tools which is what had happened with me through my own jorney as I became a writer throught the development of this book. And then, to close with the wider and wiser views that can inspire us to seek inside in us the beginner the naive the humble or to keep ourselves in the state that Steve Jobs took from "The Whold Earth Catalog," his plea to "Stay Hungry, stay foolish." 




#### Editor-critic 

Naturally other thoughts too had helped me to release myself from that spot, such as when I read from Julia Cameron - from The Right to Write - great thoughts about the importance of writing by asking my editor-critic to stay aside which took me to give full permission to write with errors which had taken my writing to be closer to myself which had taken me to write things from my heart instead of being busy trying to write what is right. Having liberated myself from the situation of being the controller of a tool - and the effects of being controlled by the tool - I kept on using the tool but with a whole new perspective. To give you an example, I had asked the tool to give me the dates for a well-known pistol manufacturing company around the American Civil War, the dates for when Apple II was released, that kind of thing. Plus, I had asked the tool to read some of my drafts and to make a summary - as in trying to simulate what a specific kind of audience would take from an essay. Notice the difference - I kept in the space not of a controller or a master. I moved myself to the position of a being open. I have accepted that writing is a simple activity, to a certain extent. I have accepted that I could write with errors, to a certain extent. I have accepted that this AI tool is amazing, to a certain extent. In other words, I moved from the spot of being a controller to being humble. It took me to write for more than 150 days as a job and to grow the draft from 300 pages to 600 pages. I took me to understand better the themes too, to connect with the audience, to connect with myself, to connect with these so many sources that are helping me - sources from inside of me and outside, like these great authors. 


#### Iceberg 


Tati Ferreira, from the channel AcidezFeminina, raised a question during a debate in the 2018 elections, asking, "If all the money that was siphoned off had been invested in the state, would we be looking at a different scenario? I think this is a question on many people's minds, though I'm not sure if there are any definitive answers."

Eduardo Oinegue responded, "Absolutely not. Even if you redirected every penny of corrupt funds into public policies, it would not result in any tangible improvement in public policies. However, the energy that these managers expend to orchestrate a corruption framework represents time not spent addressing societal issues." He concluded, "By not working for society, it's as if their answer is yes, because their dedication lies with their own interests, not those of society."

The metaphor of the "Iceberg of Corruption" was used to illustrate the point:

The tip above the water represents the stolen funds.
Beneath the surface lies the time corrupt individuals spend scheming about theft, which could otherwise be spent on positive endeavors.
