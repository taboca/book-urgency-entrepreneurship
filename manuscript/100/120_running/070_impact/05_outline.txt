# Review 

Now the problem for between Meaty and Harriet Tubman goes back to the challenging situation of one to be the leadership of its own transformation process under the realization of its present potential of its present potential. As we have considered, we have noticed that anxiety may be present by the fears in front of growth and certainly out of any successful movement growth is happening to more or less extent. Any special fears and anxieties might be present as for accessing knowledge and being honest about self-growth is required in front of that possibility of the newest part that must be understood, which we don't know. In this specifically situation we know too of the power of the context in influencing our ability and interest in knowing, specifically I shall refer to a research in Afraid of Becoming a Leader where they tested suggesting different podcasts as in supporting one to become a leader versus content that is not supportive and were able to measure that results were different in terms of openness for people to become actual leaders. In other words, certainly we know of the power of the supporting system. In other words, certainly we know of the power of the supporting system. Now, the solution to the paradox lies in revisiting values under new circumstances. And doing the analysis of the network of allies and external environment. With willingness to enter the meaningful and thoughtful reflection about the transformation going on. In other words, and especially considering a world that is impacting in largely the external environment, whatever is going on in terms of execution needs to acknowledge the new future. And the philosophical implications and the support given by the new future.

## other religion vs 

There is, perhaps, a key movement and insight from Dorothea Brandy about the consciousness, her awareness, that people may get from religion. Which I don't know exactly if that's an idea from Dorothea Brandy or not, but if so, and if it is, it might be in the beginning of the book Wake Up and Live. And she makes a point about the situation that is needed to happen for anyone who does not have religion on their side. And that might be the actual key for anyone to solve the problem of what to do for the future. In terms of self-growth required for pursuing the path of impact.


* Harriet's objective, although not clear from the beginning, kept connected with the considerations of what makes an objective, as given by Michael Dearing in GM2 - consistent with your values, reflects your first principles, world-view, generates pride, sense of accomplishment. 

* Dorothea Brandy in page 14 in the book Wake Up and Live, she indicates that to fail we spend energy and that same energy should be used to succeed. Now here is a quote where she indicates a comparative model that can be misleading for us. Open quote, now this is something which we seldom see at once, period, because we commonly think of failure as the conventional opposite of success, comma, we continue to make false antithesis of the qualities which attend success and failure, period, success is praising active alert, semicolon, so the typical attitude of failure, comma, we believe, comma, must be lethargy, comma, inertia, comma, a supine position, period, true enough, semicolon, but that does not mean that no energy is being used, period, end quote. Now, I think that indeed when we consider failure as a state of not using resources like being stalled, meaning not using resources, surely the possibility of growth towards success, the active state, will give us the idea that success demands new energy. And to reconcile this comparative operating mechanism with the problem of growth, the implication is that once we achieve certain success, from whatever means we found where the growth's feedback is perceived or validated, we arrive at the condition of perceiving or accounting the cost of that new operationalization of the situation we have. In other words, we set up a factor and know the cost of operating the factor. Now, it comes naturally that we know growth may be desired and we may think that again by the same comparative mechanism, the new new growth condition might demand more energy than the prior, than the current state. So if we're already using X amount of energy, that must be X plus Y. And by that mechanism, we're neglecting and ignoring the entrepreneurial mechanism of change that is necessary and which is the actual mechanism that brought the prior growth in the first place, which is the implied necessity for finding a model of value creation that does not work at the same linearity. So essentially, the problem for growth, which is the mechanism of leadership, consists and should only find its answer by breaking that linearity, which goes along with the observation that we see from through the various stages of the bleed scaling, scaling models, model and stages, that the leader moving across the stages is essentially releasing from the actual activities by embracing the higher order activities that goes along with a strong characterization of its contributions towards culture.

## scaling model creative destruction of execution model of current 

So, here is a to-do item that should suggest a solution for the chapter impact and actual dilemma or paradox of Harriet Tubman rising from Minty and the skating model that Michael Deering has suggested. The point from Dorothea Brandy in page 14 in the book Wake Up and Live, she indicates that to fail we spend energy and that same energy should be used to succeed. Now here is a quote where she indicates a comparative model that can be misleading for us. Open quote, now this is something which we seldom see at once, period, because we commonly think of failure as the conventional opposite of success, comma, we continue to make false antithesis of the qualities which attend success and failure, period, success is praising active alert, semicolon, so the typical attitude of failure, comma, we believe, comma, must be lethargy, comma, inertia, comma, a supine position, period, true enough, semicolon, but that does not mean that no energy is being used, period, end quote. Now, I think that indeed when we consider failure as a state of not using resources like being stalled, meaning not using resources, surely the possibility of growth towards success, the active state, will give us the idea that success demands new energy. And to reconcile this comparative operating mechanism with the problem of growth, the implication is that once we achieve certain success, from whatever means we found where the growth's feedback is perceived or validated, we arrive at the condition of perceiving or accounting the cost of that new operationalization of the situation we have.

Into the item here that also should be a contribution for the chapter entitled impact is To review and check the meditation for Michael Deering about change That guided meditation might actually have something about what it takes to enter this space of growth in terms of self leadership and Self-respect About your future self and the future of your organization which allows you to transcend through

PG accross chapters - Marcio have copied a quote from Paul Graham that was way ahead, in chapter 3, to now; because it needs to be evident, from the beginning of the book, that growth is the situation we are talking; this creates a match with the audience. Moreover, we need to make sure that the audience gets to this point with a full awareness of the growth situation. @meta-refid 1212-3212-3328-3834

* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Part One, Impact - A note, consideration for an insight to be used within the chapter entitled Impact. When writing Morning Pages, I have considered an insight, an idea that aligns with what Dorothea Brande said which perhaps aligns with that path that we get in line with what she called The Will to Fail. But I think I came upon another perspective for the same truth, which is that we're unwilling to kill our lions when it is time to reset ourselves into growth. Thus, it is not that we accept death, as in that we guide ourselves to the death slowly, as in pushing ourselves slowing from the cliff. But, in alignment with her thinking, we may accept death or the Will to Fail as we do not accept to reborn again, reinvent ourselves again, to be open again, to make mistakes again, and that's basically maybe there is an alignment with being naked, an idea from Steve Jobs, and also correlates with the Raw Fear ideas from Doug Leone. This idea may be supportive to our chapter Impact because it may have a correlation with the story from Michael Dearing (Harriet and scaling model). @meta-refid 1234-4354-7474-8383
