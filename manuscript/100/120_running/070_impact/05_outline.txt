* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Impact - Treat objection of hero, and case for hero's time for non-heroic transcending, When we recognize the hero's case, in p.113 ("In theory, this should be good, ... ) we need to do so also acknowledgingg the potential objection (Like Paulo colleage of PM world has given to Marcio once) that the a state of flow that allows one to give superpowers can be good; thus we recognize that supporting confidence for a human, like the self, towards growth is key, but the reason for acknowledging this is to allow moving on, while be specific that reflections on ways to support confidence and development are being discussed elesewhere, such as in wantrepreneur, which points back our frame goal of the future, which has a start to grow, which naturally requires transcending which does not mean killing the "self in progress" and means more to allow the "self representing the whole in progress", some time to that. Thus, this statement shapes the A, general line for points given. 478248274-4294924729-983953-43984983

@meta @todo 
* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Identity - Growth feat. PG accross chapters - Marcio have copied a quote from Paul Graham that was way ahead, in chapter 3, to now; because it needs to be evident, from the beginning of the book, that growth is the situation we are talking; this creates a match with the audience. Moreover, we need to make sure that the audience gets to this point with a full awareness of the growth situation. @meta-refid 1212-3212-3328-3834

@meta @todo 
* @todo - p1 (Done, dup of 12-3212-3328-3834) - In Identity - Check if the situation of growth should be brought to the beginning, as the situation or the complication of the intro; and if this was introduced in the book before, such as in Wantrepreneur. @meta-refid 1212-3231-3349-9393

* Note - Check outline, because under Vision we had a section with the case of Brian and learner. "* Answer - Infinite learner? Situation is of New Sport. Complication is Transition needs. Solution is humble. More than infinite learner, infinite apprentice. (p. 169)"

* points from Lost and found 




* @todo - p1 ( ) - Strategic, general - Consider a word about "Strategic Inflection Points" in the context of the entrepreneur being. @meta-refid 1212-2292-9393-9449

* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Part One, Impact - A note, consideration for an insight to be used within the chapter entitled Impact. When writing Morning Pages, I have considered an insight, an idea that aligns with what Dorothea Brande said which perhaps aligns with that path that we get in line with what she called The Will to Fail. But I think I came upon another perspective for the same truth, which is that we're unwilling to kill our lions when it is time to reset ourselves into growth. Thus, it is not that we accept death, as in that we guide ourselves to the death slowly, as in pushing ourselves slowing from the cliff. But, in alignment with her thinking, we may accept death or the Will to Fail as we do not accept to reborn again, reinvent ourselves again, to be open again, to make mistakes again, and that's basically maybe there is an alignment with being naked, an idea from Steve Jobs, and also correlates with the Raw Fear ideas from Doug Leone. This idea may be supportive to our chapter Impact because it may have a correlation with the story from Michael Dearing (Harriet and scaling model). @meta-refid 1234-4354-7474-8383
