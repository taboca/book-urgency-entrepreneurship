# Impact 





<!--
@outline - situation

Before we conclude part one, and given that we have celebrated characterizations of the founder - or the roles of the founder or the startup entity - in terms of a conscious execution, we should how the enlightened by an entrepreneurial action of the self is connected with the startup growth in ways that causes in impact in the world. This brings us to a particular curve [^footnote_michaeldearing_lectures_curve], one in which Silicon Valley investor Michael Dearing calls his favorite curve, one which he can't resist to bring up when in the beginning of many of lectures. Michael is thankful to professor Delong from Berkeley for coming up with that nice curve. It's a graph that shows the GDP per capita, through time, from One Million B.C. to the present [^footnote_braddelong_graph_curve]. In addition, he chops off the period between 1 million B.C. and 1000 (Dearing, M., 2018, 1:58), concluding that nothing special were happening. Now, as for what is left for consideration, and before celebrating the exciting period, Michael reminds us about the particular period around the 1eth century when our productivity dropped badly, the plague: 

[^footnote_michaeldearing_lectures_curve]: Michael's favorite curve can be seen in at least three of his talks: *Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction* (Greylock, 2015), *Two Blasts from the Past* (Spero Ventures, 2018), *Executive Communication* (Heavybit, 2019). 

[^footnote_braddelong_graph_curve]: Michael's favorite graph refers to the work of professor Brad Delong. You can see comments about his graph from https://www.bradford-delong.com/2014/05/estimates-of-world-gdp-one-million-bc-present-1998-my-view-as-of-1998-the-honest-broker-for-the-week-of-may-24-2014.html

Leaving that dark period in the past, and moving to when things started to look different - throughout the industrial revolution - we see the world's producvitity growing and and kept on growing fast. Any ressemblance with the hokey stick alike exponential image is not a mere coincidence. Michael points too that many things had happened and are happening, good and bad things. But to the point, he points, or prompt us to reflect, about how that the curve pays for everything. If I accept the challenge, from the many thoughts about how it pays, when I try to extract a sort of "small version" of the curve applicaple to our lives, a parallel which can be observable, I think of a mother who offers safety to her baby in the first place, and then she supports the movement, a little exploration, far from her leg and then awaits her back to her arms. Or perhaps the angel investor who joins the startup boat, and gives support offering resources and perspectives, or protection to the future of the business, enabling them to learn or to do that exploratory work, and welcoming back the team for the sake of growth. Or I can remember too some of the considerations we have seen from the chapter Environment, given by the rise of platforms like after the iPhone which enabled app-based ride-sharing experiences that had changed transportation.

* @prior - 1 - In Foreword, World, Creative Destruction in the foreword - "These solutions, much of it materialized as mechanical solutions, were fruits of human work and collaboration at the epicenter of a destruction to an economic order heavily based on slavery. The rising new economic model were supported by technological innovations that redefined rules of labor force that went along with societal changes in the system and shaped a new economy. The situation in the United States, the north vs. south confrontation, illustrated the advancement of the new order and how it deconstructed a present economic order where slavery persisted. As these worlds collided, the industrial revolution defined the economic context that accelerated the destruction of the old economic system based on slavery and gave rise to a new system that brought freedom to certain extent or innovation. This new pace, a new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come." 

* @prior - 2 - In Accounting  - Not really defined Creative Destruction. Consider to take out? Reduce? @Accounting:"Now has Schumpeter misunderstood the entrepreneur reducing it as the pure doer? No, I would think, exactly because of a premisse that the incessant doer brings about freedom from the current stream, from the way things are done. It other words it is plausiable to think that doing leads to reinvention just like writing every day leads to clear writing. But the very twist lies in the fact that the incessant doer does it by getting things done in ways that breaks stability, or the norm, because if not the acceptance of the equilibrium may also mean that there is not nothing to be done anyway. The view from this perspective, that getting things done means changing the environment, allow us to consider the very Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction although applicable to the individual that does it: the situation that when they see it, and when they feel empowered to act on it, involves them challenge themselves, their conforming selves, the one that would not do anything at all about what frustrates them. In other words, the doer that breaks the norm follows from the necessary challenging of their position of inaction, thus challenging her own status quo, which provokes to bring about change to themselves in the first place and by that they hope to do the same to the external environment, minimally provoking the outside with stories, if not with the materializations of things that carry on their stories further."

* @prior - 3 - In Environment, in a footnote - "[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can create the conditions for an entrepreneurial function that is obsolete; which may be observable in part if we consider that many people think they are entrepreneurs while they might be building something too simple from the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction or to be considered as business as usual.

Since that curve is on our way, we like it or not, we might as well to listen to signals from it with the hope of supporting our quest for impact. One key point might be a catch with the curve - as in a thing in it which may take us to take things for granted. On the surface, we certain see that exponential rise of productivity, that indeed does pay for everything. Now as for the unseen element, we should acknowledge the implied process of destruction that is not generally accounted by the first impression. This is so because what gets accounted is the sum of the output as told, as history tells, which goes well with our intents and how stories are told - we do account by using the metrics of our days. Nevertheless, these can be the hidden efforts, or the negative additions,  which is unfair to call them negative to start with exaclty because we know that our failures, our mistakes, are in fact the thing that take us to learn, to be creative, to to reinvent, then to come back to the positive. Back to the macro chart, the idea is carried by a process know of Creative Destruction [^footnote_schumpeter_creative_descruction] considered by Joseph Schumpeter.

[^footnote_schumpeter_creative_descruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development. 












## Being responsible 


Now, this brief lookup at the macro curve is important because the movement to that curve - think of a little push towards the exponential growth - does so because entities that acts in ways which go along with the what the startup does by the definition of Paul Graham - the one we brought in the introduction - where startup equals to growth, which we shall recapitulate again:

PG accross chapters - Marcio have copied a quote from Paul Graham that was way ahead, in chapter 3, to now; because it needs to be evident, from the beginning of the book, that growth is the situation we are talking; this creates a match with the audience.

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth."* (Graham, 2012)

This time, however, we should dig within the meaning of "fast" because it also supports that movement of impact into the major curve. In *Startup = Growth* (2012) Paul Graham approaches that subject, when considering the theme of rate, by eliciting the consciousness about the relative movement: 

> *"So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a startup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have. For founders that's more than a theoretical question, because it's equivalent to asking if they're on the right path." (Graham, Paul., 2012)
 
He points out a kind of holistic process of growth where although it starts slow, in its path for figuring out, its slowness is "partly due to internal limits and partly because the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the markets it serves."

This intent for impact sets the necessity for structure that reconciles the creative element from ideas and the necessity of materialization of the business. Throughout the Blitzscaling lectures, Reid Hoffman kept on wondering about the characterizations both in terms of structure and logic and challenges. A special and structured insight was given in response to how founders should evaluate themselves across these stages:  


> *"First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to, hopefully God willing, turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)

@outline - Recognition of the challenging from being successful and leaving the perspective for scale. 
--> 







This is then solid and structured, as a general requirement for us to be conductors. It's a 3-tier endeavor. Just like a reflection was necessary for the fast part given that a "startup is a company designed to grow fast," Michael's perspective give us too a signal for what is next - that "God" word is the sign and reminder of these "different sets of pursuits with very little in common." This is Michael reminding ourselves of how we feel when we are in front of certain situations where change is required but in ways we may not know. It's in our language, believers of God or not, and it does express the complex feeling, from one who is required to look at what happens not with the eyes of the man, our views of the present. 

Now, if we follow that sign, which I'll frame it as G-O-D, the Good Old Dilemma of entrepreneurship, it goes along with the implied transformation of evolving process in the macro curve, requiring the creative destruction, with the startup impact by push growth in the market, which involves the characterizations of *Do Things That Don't Scale*, which will set us in the necessity of a movement of transcending of the self. 

Therefore, reconciling these two maps is really key, because the growth of the startup only happens in ways that impact the general growth, which characterizes the continued growth by the process of creative destruction, which on the other hand on the startup growth side means figuring out from the conscious movement the way to break the speed of the curve in relative terms with the implied characterizations of the do things that don't scale and the general consciousness movement and all of that set us to face the challenges of transcending.

Which brings us back to reality and some of the key fundamental characterizations of the self, the founder, the doer, which goes back getting things done and the necessity for something great that is implied. And from our actions, when that shows traction, which brings as a consequence the inevitable, us to operate in ways that feels productive, and proactive, energetic, into the flow. In other words, it may be due to the greatness of achievement that we feel bad about the idea of looking to ourselves as a sort of biggest stone on our way. 

In other views, only a view from far may actually see the greatest of all movements as a movement that is inadequate. According to angel investor Jason Calacanis [^footnote_jasoncalacanis_reactive], the biggest mistake founders make is that they become maniacs: They enter in a reactionary mode, responding to emails, tweets, and openning tickets in whatever project management system they like. We get into the business of putting out fires and don't reconsider the risky place we set ourselves in, in the first place: 

[^footnote_jasoncalacanis_reactive]: Jason Calacanis is an American entrepreneur, angel investor, and author known for his investments in various tech startups and his role in the podcasting and media industry. He is the founder of several companies, including Mahalo.com, Inside.com, and the podcast "This Week in Startups." In this talk (Calacanis, Jason., 2017) Jason reminds founders of the perils of their movement which he referred as reactionary.

> *"What founders don't realize is that in a lot of times what you need is down time, and space in your brain, for ideas, and for revelations and for insights to happen."* (Calacanis, Jason., 2017, 3:10)

Yet, and again, sometimes we can grasp these ideas in theory but nothing is like to be in that complex space living the feeling of what happens, especially when doing it well, where to consider balancing out, if can be considered at all, is very uncomfortable, or feels very unproductive. To consider us as beings that awaits for a very relation, that pulls an instant picture of us. We look at this picture using our so called objective lenses, we materialize that frame, that does not look like real doers or productive workers. 












This feeling of discomfort is a subject for us worth reflecting. Why is it that we set ourselves and feel that discomfort which may seem not as the state of happiness? That comes through the many ways when we are passing through those moments of change: That raw fear, felt by the Mr. Leone in the face his VC-firm's firm belief of reinventing itself; those feelings of loss or stages of grief as given by Mr. Grove when considering Intel through the inflection points, through facing death from in the chaotic situation of the 10x force and facing the fears of commitment to reign in chaos; The startup painful situation through the trough of sorrow, given by top-tier investor-advisors like Paul Graham and Andrew Chen asking them to be patient enough and call to pull real value from the learning lessons and the decline from launches; The fear of not being right of the young writer, needed to be faced before becoming a writer. With all these situations, there is something sad, something that we propagate to ourselves. 

This is where we are going next, because this is, perhaps, something worth reflecting, to wonder about that sadness or confusing or uncomfortable space and how that mindset impacts us in the first place, and how that may prevent us to see through when seeing through is needed. For the next sections, we will celebrate first an experience of transformation of a hero from history, a blast from the past; a story that may take us to reflect about the ways to scale ourselves. And we shall conclude with thoughts about healthy ways to be comfortable with these challenges of change.

* James Green on improving tolerance for ambiguity - "To understand your own tolerance for ambiguity, consider your comfort with uncertainty, with change, and with unfamiliar situations. Think about how you can improve your tolerance through experience. As you experience new things, the next time that you experience them, they’re not new. You have new know-how. You have new capabilities that you’ve established. You have new insights, new relationships, and new resource for next time. Trying new things beyond your comfort zone, professionally and personally, is a good way to develop your tolerance for ambiguity." (Green, James., p. 36, )
