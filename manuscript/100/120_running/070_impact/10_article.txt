Silicon Valley investor Michael Dearing, of Harrison Metal, can't resist to start many of his lectures [^footnote_michaeldearing_lectures_curve] showing a curve. And he always says that that is his favorite curve. And he always say thanks to professor Delong from Berkeley for coming up with that nice curve. It's a graph that shows the GDP per capita, through time, from One Million B.C. to the present [^footnote_braddelong_graph_curve]. In addition, he chops off the period between 1 million B.C. and 1000 (Dearing, M., 2018, 1:58), concluding that nothing special were happening. Now, as for what is left for consideration, and before celebrating the exciting period, Michael reminds us about the particular period around the 1eth century when our productivity dropped badly, the plague: 

[^footnote_michaeldearing_lectures_curve]: Michael's favorite curve can be seen in at least three of his talks: *Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction* (Greylock, 2015), *Two Blasts from the Past* (Spero Ventures, 2018), *Executive Communication* (Heavybit, 2019). 

[^footnote_braddelong_graph_curve]: Michael's favorite graph refers to the work of professor Brad Delong. You can see comments about his graph from https://www.bradford-delong.com/2014/05/estimates-of-world-gdp-one-million-bc-present-1998-my-view-as-of-1998-the-honest-broker-for-the-week-of-may-24-2014.html

Leaving that dark period in the past, he take us into where things started to look different, through the industrial revolution where world's producvitity started to grow and kept on growing fast. He highlights too that through that many good and bad things had happened and are happening. But his points, to the point, is that the curve pays for everything. Which means that what can be done can be done by using the resources and ideas from others - in alignment with what we have considred in the chapter entitled Environment. Of course, as we have considered too, it goes with that that or ideas, our own management, our conscious thinking, is key in the face of how to use best the existing building blocks or use or revisting the playbooks to keep getting things done in better ways. With all of that, we feel the pressure, the heat, what it is like to be in the middle of it.

@cross #creativedestruction

* @prior - 1 - In Foreword, World, Creative Destruction in the foreword - "These solutions, much of it materialized as mechanical solutions, were fruits of human work and collaboration at the epicenter of a destruction to an economic order heavily based on slavery. The rising new economic model were supported by technological innovations that redefined rules of labor force that went along with societal changes in the system and shaped a new economy. The situation in the United States, the north vs. south confrontation, illustrated the advancement of the new order and how it deconstructed a present economic order where slavery persisted. As these worlds collided, the industrial revolution defined the economic context that accelerated the destruction of the old economic system based on slavery and gave rise to a new system that brought freedom to certain extent or innovation. This new pace, a new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come." 

* @prior - 2 - In Accounting  - Not really defined Creative Destruction. Consider to take out? Reduce? @Accounting:"Now has Schumpeter misunderstood the entrepreneur reducing it as the pure doer? No, I would think, exactly because of a premisse that the incessant doer brings about freedom from the current stream, from the way things are done. It other words it is plausiable to think that doing leads to reinvention just like writing every day leads to clear writing. But the very twist lies in the fact that the incessant doer does it by getting things done in ways that breaks stability, or the norm, because if not the acceptance of the equilibrium may also mean that there is not nothing to be done anyway. The view from this perspective, that getting things done means changing the environment, allow us to consider the very Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction although applicable to the individual that does it: the situation that when they see it, and when they feel empowered to act on it, involves them challenge themselves, their conforming selves, the one that would not do anything at all about what frustrates them. In other words, the doer that breaks the norm follows from the necessary challenging of their position of inaction, thus challenging her own status quo, which provokes to bring about change to themselves in the first place and by that they hope to do the same to the external environment, minimally provoking the outside with stories, if not with the materializations of things that carry on their stories further."

* @prior - 3 - In Environment, in a footnote - "[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can create the conditions for an entrepreneurial function that is obsolete; which may be observable in part if we consider that many people think they are entrepreneurs while they might be building something too simple from the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction or to be considered as business as usual. "

Now since that curve is on our way, the way of founders and their business either they like it or not, we might as well listen to signals from it; to look for further advice in our quest for success or impact. A key point has to do with a catch with the curve. On the surface, what we see is a a version of productivity that does pay for everything, indeed. Thus, it is not unfair to take a small version of the curve which is applicaple to our lives, a parallel that can be observable. For example, by the mother who offers safety to her baby and supports the movement, a little exploration, far from her leg and then awaits her back to her arms. The angel investor who joins the startup boat, and giving support by the resources and perspectives or protection to the future of the business, enabling them to learn and do an exploration work, and welcoming back the team for the sake of growth.

Now as for the unseen element, we shall consider the implicit process of destruction, which is hidden by the gross sum. This is so because what gets accounted, visually, gets to be a sum of the output as told, as history tells, which goes well with how stories of success are made, inline with the output of an accounting process which is oriented to the metrics of our days. Nevertheless, these hidden moments are the negative elements, which is unfair to call them negative to start with; exaclty because although these appear connected with our failures, our mistakes, these are the moments taking us to learn, and to reinvent, and to be creative. Back to the macro chart, the idea is carried by a process know of Creative Destruction [^footnote_schumpeter_creative_descruction] considered by Joseph Schumpeter.

[^footnote_schumpeter_creative_descruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development.

@outline - complication 
--> 







Such digging with the whole curve reveals the key element to our quest, involving failure and learning, which set us to respect the managerial effort which needs to recognize these elements. Thus it follows, for the sake of the continued growth, that the situation of a prior bad management, of a bad kingdom, either leave the seat to a strange new management and a strange new queen or the queen gets to stays if she happen to creatively destroy her bad management. In other words, the curve of growth does not care. Thus, if we do not follow through, the curve offers the seat, it does capture some value of it. Thus, the curve may make dust out of us if we do not respond [^footnote_through_inflection_points] as if it is a self-cleaning oven. Thus, once in that oven, our mission is to figure how to set ourselves fresh again. This necessity sets our challenge as people who a) need to respect our successes, our past movement which worked, but at the same time to be ready to be free from our own perspectives. The consequence is that we, and our colleagues, cannot be expendable, as we have considered in the first chapter entitled Accountin. In other words, if we follow our success curve, by pouring resources that we have acquired, and the knowledge as acquired, from the perspective and the goggles of our past, no matter how successful we are that movement will only set ourselves to be out of the way of the curve ahead somewhere - sooner or later. 

[^footnote_through_inflection_points]: The idea of us being recycled into dust might set ourselves to consider the inflection points which Andy Grove had given to us as we have considered in a prior section, the reflection which applies to individuals, to our teams, and to any grown up organization.

Now, with this principle set and as we proceed into how to create impact, or not to be out from the curve, I shall first celebrate the handy thought from Reid Hoffman, which he carries in his pocket, the idea that "what got you here won't get you there." This observation gains special color in the face of the circumstances of a startup, or through growth stages of the startup which accounting to the Blitzscaling phases of growth start with family, tribe, village, city, and nation. In other words, his point is that, again, and again, that challenge is alive.

Next, we will first make it formal our landspace for growth which shall frame our challenge as conductors and to value our efforts of leadership from the start. To celebrate the rise of a leader from a dooer, we will reflect about the life of a hero history which were able, through getting things done, to grow herself, which took her to be alive across stages of growth of her mission. To end, we will consider a model based on compassion where we respect our sucesses but also respect our beginners, as key for the path of leadership required for growth.

Now the first thing before we move into solving this equation for impact, is to frame the situation for our startups and ourselves, to set our expectations derived from that curve. For the startup, this formality can be celebrated with the startup definition from Paul Graham from his article entitled *Startup equals to Growth*:

PG accross chapters - Marcio have copied a quote from Paul Graham that was way ahead, in chapter 3, to now; because it needs to be evident, from the beginning of the book, that growth is the situation we are talking; this creates a match with the audience. Moreover, we need to make sure that the audience gets to this point with a full awareness of the growth situation. @meta-refid 1212-3212-3328-3834

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth."* (Graham, 2012)

Now a reflection is worth about the meaning of fast. This circles back to that notion that our environment may, to a great extent, expect more from us or that it may appear to do so. It may then dictacte certain movements, either by giving us building blocks, which appears to be faster. As an illustration, from our chapter Environment, we recounted some of the conditions from the environment that have supported the rise Uber (and other ride-hailing solutions that emerged at the time) from the perspective of technologies, as in Iphone shipped, GPS integrated, 3G network; and on the other hand emerging people's needs, the audience's interest in transportation improvements such as to ask for a taxi from anywhere.

Which brings us to honor a moment of reflection about the meaning of growing fast for ourselves, as leaders, especially given that potential movement which may set us to move by instincts. In this regard, I we go back to celebrate that idea of the *Infinite Apprentice*, given to us from from Brian Chesky and Reid Hoffman. From rian's point of view, using the sports metaphor, the challenge of going through the stages it not about one becoming skilled in the same sport but learning a whole new sport [^footnote_blizscaling_brianchesky_new_sport]. Throughout the Blitzscaling lectures, Reid Hoffman kept on wondering about interpretations and characterizations of the challenge. A special and structured insight was given in response to how founders should evaluate themselves across these stages:  

[^footnote_blizscaling_brianchesky_new_sport]: In Blitzscaling lecture number 18 (2015), Reid Hoffman asked Brian about the challenges of being a leader when the startup is going through the growth stages of Blitzscaling; to which Brian pointed out first about the absence of guidance for these transitions, stressing that leaders must evolve their perspective because the situation demands a whole new mindset as if the leader is being exposed to a whole new sport on every phase.

> *"First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to, hopefully God willing, turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)

@outline - Recognition of the challenging from being successful and leaving the perspective for scale.

This is then solid and structured, as a general requirement for us to be conductors. It's a 3-tier endeavor. Now, and since our problems are not over, and just like a reflection was necessary for the fast part given that a "startup is a company designed to grow fast," Michael's perspective give us too a signal for what is next - that God word which I think is a sign. This is Michael reminding ourselves of how we feel when we are in front of certain situations where change is required but in ways we may not know. It's in our language, believers of God or not, and it does express the complex feeling, from one who is required to look at what happens not with the eyes of the man, our views of the present. 

If I follow that sign, which I see as G.O.D., it may take us to the Good Old Dilemma of entrepreneurship. One which essentially circles back to that hidden and special thing under our general curve, that necessity for creative destruction. And again, refining our context, this dilemma is essentially about respecting a force that essentially asks us to honor the the past, and the present, as an the thing that give us the opportunity to live, to move. From that, from that getting things done in the first place, we move. In addition to that, to use the opportunity from that prior movement, successes acquired, to fuel ourselves. And in addition to that, to use that fuel to balance out our viewpoints and with that our activities. To see things from perspective. 







Now all of that sounds great, in theory, but not really in the real world of action such as after we make the right movement, after we do something great. This is so because of so many factors we have considered - like love and support from the environment - which essentially energizes us. And from our actions, when that shows traction, which brings as a consequence the inevitable, us to operate in ways that feels productive, and proactive, energetic, into the flow. In other words, it may be due to the greatness of achievement that we feel bad about the idea of looking to ourselves as a sort of biggest stone on our way. 

In other views, only a view from far may actually see the greatest of all movements as a movement that is inadequate. According to angel investor Jason Calacanis [^footnote_jasoncalacanis_reactive], the biggest mistake founders make is that they become maniacs: They enter in a reactionary mode, responding to emails, tweets, and openning tickets in whatever project management system they like. We get into the business of putting out fires and don't reconsider the risky place we set ourselves in, in the first place: 

[^footnote_jasoncalacanis_reactive]: Jason Calacanis is an American entrepreneur, angel investor, and author known for his investments in various tech startups and his role in the podcasting and media industry. He is the founder of several companies, including Mahalo.com, Inside.com, and the podcast "This Week in Startups." In this talk (Calacanis, Jason., 2017) Jason reminds founders of the perils of their movement which he referred as reactionary.

> *"What founders don't realize is that in a lot of times what you need is down time, and space in your brain, for ideas, and for revelations and for insights to happen."* (Calacanis, Jason., 2017, 3:10)

--> 



Yet, and again, sometimes we can grasp these ideas in theory but nothing is like to be in that complex space living the feeling of what happens, especially when doing it well, where to consider balancing out, if can be considered at all, is very uncomfortable, or feels very unproductive. To consider us as beings that awaits for a very relation, that pulls an instant picture of us. We look at this picture using our so called objective lenses, we materialize that frame, that does not look like real doers or productive workers. 












This feeling of discomfort is a subject for us worth reflecting. Why is it that we set ourselves and feel that discomfort which may seem not as the state of happiness? That comes through the many ways when we are passing through those moments of change: That raw fear, felt by the Mr. Leone in the face his VC-firm's firm belief of reinventing itself; those feelings of loss or stages of grief as given by Mr. Grove when considering Intel through the inflection points, through facing death from in the chaotic situation of the 10x force and facing the fears of commitment to reign in chaos; The startup painful situation through the trough of sorrow, given by top-tier investor-advisors like Paul Graham and Andrew Chen asking them to be patient enough and call to pull real value from the learning lessons and the decline from launches; The fear of not being right of the young writer, needed to be faced before becoming a writer. With all these situations, there is something sad, something that we propagate to ourselves. 

This is where we are going next, because this is, perhaps, something worth reflecting, to wonder about that sadness or confusing or uncomfortable space and how that mindset impacts us in the first place, and how that may prevent us to see through when seeing through is needed. For the next sections, we will celebrate first an experience of transformation of a hero from history, a blast from the past; a story that may take us to reflect about the ways to scale ourselves. And we shall conclude with thoughts about healthy ways to be comfortable with these challenges of change.
