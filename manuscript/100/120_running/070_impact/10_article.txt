Silicon Valley investor Michael Dearing, of Harrison Metal, consistently starts his special talks - such as *Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction* (Greylock, 2015) and *Two Blasts from the Past* (Spero Ventures, 2018) and *Executive Communication* (Heavybit, 2019) - showing a curve. And he always says that that  is his favorite curve. And he always say thanks to professor Brad Delong, from Berkeley, for setting up that nice curve. It's a graph that shows the GDP per capita, through time, from One Million B.C. to the present [^footnote_braddelong_graph_curve]. In addition, Michael chops off the period between 1 million B.C. and 1000, concluding that he didn't find anything to great happening. (Dearing, Michael., 2018, 1:58) 

[^footnote_braddelong_graph_curve]: Michael's favorite graph refers to the work of professor Brad Delong. You can see comments about his graph from https://www.bradford-delong.com/2014/05/estimates-of-world-gdp-one-million-bc-present-1998-my-view-as-of-1998-the-honest-broker-for-the-week-of-may-24-2014.html

Now as for the period that is left to be considered, and before celebrating the hot period of the curve, Michael reminds us about a particular period from history when our productivity dropped badly - around the 13th century - through the plague: 

> *"In case you ever do build a time machine, please do not put the settings to that [period] because you'll have a one in three chance of not coming home. The population drop was precipitous, particularly in Europe. And so the productivity, really what GDP per capita is, collapsed."* (Dearing, 2015, 3:42)

Leaving that dark period in the past, he take us into where things started to look different, through the industrial revolution where world's producvitity started to grow and went on growing fast. His remarks too that through thtat many good and bad things have happened and are happening. But his points, to the point, that the curve does pays for everything. The curve also set us to consider that the many things that can be done can be done by using the resources and ideas from others - an idea that works in synchronicity with some of our considerations from the chapter entitled Environment where we recognized that resources, the building blocks, are richer and abundand, and the rise of platforms, therefore playbooks. With that, as well, we considered how that all that are given to us may too be the very reason for us to revisit our playbooks, mainly to reflect before following the too-fast train. With all of this we feel, not only by being in the middle of it, that it is a space that is active, with lots of motion, with things happening too fast, therefore a heated space.

* @prior - 1 - In Foreword, World, Creative Destruction in the foreword - "These solutions, much of it materialized as mechanical solutions, were fruits of human work and collaboration at the epicenter of a destruction to an economic order heavily based on slavery. The rising new economic model were supported by technological innovations that redefined rules of labor force that went along with societal changes in the system and shaped a new economy. The situation in the United States, the north vs. south confrontation, illustrated the advancement of the new order and how it deconstructed a present economic order where slavery persisted. As these worlds collided, the industrial revolution defined the economic context that accelerated the destruction of the old economic system based on slavery and gave rise to a new system that brought freedom to certain extent or innovation. This new pace, a new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come." 

* @prior - 2 - In Accounting  - Not really defined Creative Destruction. Consider to take out? Reduce? @Accounting:"Now has Schumpeter misunderstood the entrepreneur reducing it as the pure doer? No, I would think, exactly because of a premisse that the incessant doer brings about freedom from the current stream, from the way things are done. It other words it is plausiable to think that doing leads to reinvention just like writing every day leads to clear writing. But the very twist lies in the fact that the incessant doer does it by getting things done in ways that breaks stability, or the norm, because if not the acceptance of the equilibrium may also mean that there is not nothing to be done anyway. The view from this perspective, that getting things done means changing the environment, allow us to consider the very Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction although applicable to the individual that does it: the situation that when they see it, and when they feel empowered to act on it, involves them challenge themselves, their conforming selves, the one that would not do anything at all about what frustrates them. In other words, the doer that breaks the norm follows from the necessary challenging of their position of inaction, thus challenging her own status quo, which provokes to bring about change to themselves in the first place and by that they hope to do the same to the external environment, minimally provoking the outside with stories, if not with the materializations of things that carry on their stories further."

* @prior - 3 - In Environment, in a footnote - "[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can create the conditions for an entrepreneurial function that is obsolete; which may be observable in part if we consider that many people think they are entrepreneurs while they might be building something too simple from the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction or to be considered as business as usual.

Now that curve, either we like it or not, is on the way of founders and their startups and their businesses so it may be worth to listen to it for further advice. A key element that supports that curve can be thought like a catch with the curve, although it is not encrusted, or visible on the surface. On the surface, indeed we do see a version of productivity that does pay for everything, which can take us to think that of a small version of the curve to our lives which maps to some extent. Thus it is not unfair to draw a parallel and it can be observable - by the mother who offers safety to her baby and allows a little exploration far from her leg and then back to her arms. The angel investor who joins the startup boat, and provide certain resources and perspectives and protection, to the future of the business, enabling the team to learn and then hugging the team in case the exploration is good. Having that mapping being celebrated, we can then go back to the curve and and consider what makes it to look like that which take us to see the unseen and to recognize the implicit process of destruction hidden by the gross sum but nevertheless required and which sustains growth. Thus, the trick is that what gets accounted, visualilly, gets to be a sum of the output as history tells the stories of success resulting from an accounting oriented to the metrics of our days. Thus, the negative elements - which is unfair to call them negative, although not apparent, is implied, our failures, our mistakes, and our learning. In macro terms, this goes in synchronicity with the process of Creative Destruction [^footnote_schumpeter_creative_descruction] considered by Joseph Schumpeter.

[^footnote_schumpeter_creative_descruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development.

@outline - complication

If we keep on mapping the underlying truths from the curve into our paths, we come to terms to face the efforts involving failure and learning, to respect these managerial elements. It follows that bad management, or bad kingdoms, leave the seat to new management, new kings; eventually, in the right moment, exactly because of that creative movement. In other words, the curve of growth does not care, and if we do not follow through. The curve shall eat ourselves, the curve will capture the value, from whoever and whatever they did through effort. And the curve will make dust out of us if we do not respond [^footnote_through_inflection_points]. This is so because the curve is a self-cleaning oven. Thus, once into thatoven, we either set ourselves fresh again or we accept the path to be grilled.  

[^footnote_through_inflection_points]: The idea of us being recycled into dust might set ourselves to consider the inflection points which Andy Grove had given to us as we have considered in a prior section, the reflection which applies to individuals, to our teams, and to any grown up organization. 

And continuing to mapping for ourselves, as individuals and our teams, it sets into us the challenge where we need to a) respect our successes, our past movement which works, but also to be ready to leave our acquired views, our perspectives. This puzzle set us to recognize that in order for us to not think of ourselves, and our colleagues, as expendable, as we have considered in the first chapter entitled Accounting, we need to face not being expendable - into the movement of growth. In other words, if we follow our success curve, by pouring resources that we have acquired, and the knowledge as acquired, from the perspective and the goggles of our past, no matter how successful we are that movement will only set ourselves to be out of the way of the curve ahead somewhere - sooner or laters.

Now, if we proceed from celebrate and into framing our challenges for to proceed into impact, not to be out from the curve, and to follow through, I ask us to celebrate the handy thought from Reid Hoffman, which he carries in his pocket, the idea that "what got you here won't get you there," and the nuanced observation in the face of the circumstances of a startup, or through growth stages of the startup -  family, tribe, village, city, and nation. In other words, again, and again, that challenge is alive, and it is the one required for the startup curve to move like the general economic curve.

Let us, first, consider the general landscape considering the situation of expected growth and general requirements for the leadership. From that, we will ride with a story from a hero of capitalism which scaled herself in the face of the the greater objectives. And we will conclude with a reflection about a model of compassion for the business in in the future and for the leader in the future.

#### Responsibility towards scale 

![](images/100/strip-rocket-160.png)





Now to frame the startup within the context, in alignment with our expectations from the curve, the first things to be considered is to map a requirement of growth. Thus our statup as an entity that is aimed to stick around, to sustain itself - this can be celebrated by the startup definition from Paul Graham:

PG accross chapters - Marcio have copied a quote from Paul Graham that was way ahead, in chapter 3, to now; because it needs to be evident, from the beginning of the book, that growth is the situation we are talking; this creates a match with the audience. Moreover, we need to make sure that the audience gets to this point with a full awareness of the growth situation. @meta-refid 1212-3212-3328-3834

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth."* (Graham, 2012)

Now a point must be made about what means fast since we might have covered growth. This circles back to that notion that our environment may, to a great extent, dictacte certain moments, or setting a context. In our chapter Environment we have considered the conditions for Uber (and other ride-hailing solutions that emerged) from the perspective of technologies - as in Iphone shipped, GPS integrated, 3G network - and people's needs - the audience's interest in solving their ride needs, such as to ask for a taxi from anywhere.

As for the meaning of growing fast for ourselves as leaders, especially in the face of that faster movement which may as well take us to move by instinct, that setting certainly take us to break down in terms of what it takes or in how we respond. And in that regard, we may celebrate the general notion of the the *Infinite Apprentice*, by the reflections from Brian Chesky and Reid Hoffman, which Brian's way to explain what it takes through the stages involved the sports metaphor recognizing that more than to be skilled one has to enjoy and learn a whole new sport [^footnote_blizscaling_brianchesky_new_sport]. And in alignment with setting structure for our challenge, throughout the Blitzscaling lectures Reid kept on essentially asking about these characterizations for moving accross. One in special, as for how founders should evaluate themselves across these stages, set the team into the in and out:  

[^footnote_blizscaling_brianchesky_new_sport]: In Blitzscaling lecture number 18 (2015), Reid Hoffman asked Brian about the challenges of being a leader when the startup is going through the growth stages of Blitzscaling; to which Brian pointed out first about the absence of guidance for these transitions, stressing that leaders must evolve their perspective because the situation demands a whole new mindset as if the leader is being exposed to a whole new sport on every phase.

> *"First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to, hopefully God willing, turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)

Now, pretty solid and simple enough and hard enough, is the given from Michael. One which breaks down the definition of the startup which does follow the general curve, now setting a requirement for us to be conductors of a 3-tier endeavor. Now, just like the fast word needed a word, as for the "startup is a company designed to grow fast," Michael's evaluation model too gives us a word that leads to another. For me, I think it's that God part, it's a sign. This is Michael reminding ourselves of the kind of change that is in front of us and how it feels if one is in that situation, unlikely happening around us. It's in our language, believers of God or not, and it does express the complex feeling when one is required to look at what happens not with the eyes of the man, our present views. 

I will follow the sign into a road I shall call it G.O.D., the Good Old Dilemma, of entrepreneurship. One which essentially circles back to that thing under our general curve, that creative destruction underlying element from within. To our context, the dilemma is about living through the force that essentially asks us to live, to move, by getting things done in the first place, indeed. But too, in addition, to use the opportunity from our movement, our successes acquired, to fuel ourselves. And too, in addition, to use that fuel to balance out, our viewpoints and with that our activities. 

And all of that may sound great, in theory, but not really in the real world of action, when we make the right movement, when we do something great. This is so because of so many factors we have considered - like love and support from the environment - which essentially energizes us. And from our actions, when that shows traction, which brings as a consequence the inevitable, us to operate in ways that feels productive, and proactive, energetic, into the flow. 







In other words, it isn't great to think of us as our biggest stones. According to angel investor Jason Calacanis [^footnote_jasoncalacanis_reactive], the biggest mistake founders make is that they become maniacs: They enter in a reactionary mode, responding to emails, tweets, and openning tickets in whatever project management system they like. We get into the business of putting out fires and don't reconsider the risky place we set ourselves in, in the first place: 

[^footnote_jasoncalacanis_reactive]: Jason Calacanis is an American entrepreneur, angel investor, and author known for his investments in various tech startups and his role in the podcasting and media industry. He is the founder of several companies, including Mahalo.com, Inside.com, and the podcast "This Week in Startups." Calacanis is also an early investor in companies like Uber and Robinhood.

> *"What founders don't realize is that in a lot of times what you need is down time, and space in your brain, for ideas, and for revelations and for insights to happen."* (Calacanis, Jason., 2017, 3:10)

--> 




Now, to hear that in theory is a thing but a key element that frames us back to that complex space is exactly the very feeling of what happens if we, doers especially when doing it well, think of the act of balancing out, the very uncomfortable place, the unproductive space, as in to be one which waits for a revelation - likely an objective objection from any real doer. And likely too, even when we are into it, finding ways to be better at time, that may certainly for many of us - by us I mean the stage of life we are - set ourselves into a sort of discomfort that is not good in terms of happiness. It may be so worth for a reflection that with all the versions of that moment of change we are yet quite not comfortable to think: The raw fear felt by the Mr. Leone in the face his VC-firm's firm belief of reinventing  itself, the feelings of loss given by Mr. Grove when considering Intel going through those inflection points, facing death from chaos, and the fears of commitment to reign in chaos. The startup's pain through the trough of sorrow given by top-tier advisor-investors who care about the early stage team. The C-confusing space of one when trying to move from B to A and the fear of not being right of the writer. With all these situations, there is something sad in the air which we propagate to ourselves. And perhaps that something is worth reflecting - about how that sadness impacts us in the first place.

In the path to solve the entrepreneurial's dilemma, which can be paradox, I ask us to consider what I call the *Minty-Tubman Growth Path*, as just a way for us to carry the quest to understand the transformation of Harriet Tubman - The Moses of Her People - rising from her past self, the enslaved Minty, Araminta Ross. In this ride we will be conduced by Michael Dearing as he had the interest in Harriet's story and drew good insights from that proposing a scaling model that supports growth of startups their teams and founders. 

The first thing to be observed, which matters for anyone in the business of getting things done but more important for startups, is the recognition that the startup exists to grow and to grow in a world that is embracing a change. The setting of a better world is a good one because it sets us to be energized. With that, it follows too the recognition of the supporting forces. Back to the days of Harriet, we could over simplify that there were certain forces from the North - forces supporting freedom and end of slavery - and on the other hand the forces from the South - forces supporting the situation as it were. 

Michael's observations, in retrospect and based his history research and analysis, he had identified characterizations of Harriet's actions taking herself to ride along the movement of freeing enslaved people which required her to grow. He maps the steps. 


<!--
@meta @todo 
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Impact - Check Michael's GM2 objective definition with Harriet's model - Harriet's objective, although not clear from the beginning, goes inline with Michael's GM2 definition of what what is an objective: consistent with your values, reflects your first principles, world-view, generates pride, sense of accomplishment. 
--> 

First, the identification of values. Her movement to free herself can be seen as a key result but of course not the ultimate outcome she wanted - it showed a connection with wish for freedom for enslaved people. As she escaped she had tested a model, and from that she saved her friends and family so all of that can be simplified now as herself exercising her values. Thus she found a model from her successes and, from that, according to Michael's second point, she exercised "quick wins building trust" and from that "recruiting allies and building a network." 

To celebrate her improvement of methods, and access to that scaling power, Michael in *Two Blasts from the Past* (2018) highlights a period around "about ten years after she had really seized her own freedom," when she became a favorite secret agent for the North. The following is a letter, which she carried in the pocket, which meant free pass in terms of transport, ability to buy supplies, and more. The letter was signed by David Hunter, a Union general and represented one of many acts of trust and support to her mission as she were at this point building a strong network of information and gathering information: 

> *"Pass the bearer, Harriet Tubman, to Beaufort and back to this place, and wherever she wishes to go; and give her free passage at all times, on all Government transports. Harriet was sent to me from Boston by Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, and is a valuable woman. She has permission, as a servant of the Government, to purchase such provisions from the Commissary as she may need."* (Bradford, 2018, p. XX).

In other words, she were growing as one of the conductors of the Underground Railroad [^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad], a secret organization responsible for freeing slaves during the times of the American Civil War. In a nutshell, at the risk of being nuts to oversimplify, she were the bearer of herself from being a little grain in a shell into becoming a pearl and to be known as the *Moses of Her People*. And she kept on doing it, even after the Civil War, helping people to become entrepreneurs. 

[^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad]: The Underground Railroad was a secret network of routes and safe houses used by enslaved African Americans to escape to free states and Canada with the help of abolitionists and allies. This clandestine effort was most active during the early to mid-19th century, leading up to the American Civil War.

The story of Harriet became for Michael a landscape for a reflect about the challenges of scaling. He came up with a map (2018, 12:42) for when teams are small leading them to get bigger. Starting with the small, we use our energy and check with our values. Achieve quick wins, you are build trust. Recruit allies, you are building your network. Michael pointed out that "she took what she knew and she taught other people how to be good conductors on the road," which meant she were crafting a play book. The outcome was that she were making small batches of sucesses, she were iterating. When bigger, the first step again which now turns her self energy and her values translated as other people's energy, people who shared the same values. Michael reminds us that Harriet was trusted with other people's resources and skills, that she were walking aroung with the equivalent of a year's salary of a senior officer. With that stronger trust network, she could approach supporters now with bolder ideas which in normal circumstances could be seen as crazy and unrealistic. Through the growth iteratins, "her networks became quite literally armies." And she kept on iterating the playbook, in other words, passing on the playbook.

The identification of values shows a good startint point for founders. Exactly because in many endeavours that people get into, they might right there have not a clear picture of values. Thus, it becomes vital for any entrepreneur to use time in this regard - work time. And it is not that founders's envisioned project don't have values - a lot of projects created with passion, and vision, actually connect with strong values. It is just that the energy to make the project real sometimes, can hide values that could also improve the founder's chances towards freeing themselves. When lacking values analysis, they can lock themselves and even bring premature ends to what they do. The search for values is then a great exercise that opens the realm of possibilities beyond one or another current project, experiment or activity that is being undertaken.

But of course, some other considerations must be embraced if we are to use the situation of Brian. We should take in the consideration the context which he were in. Consider, for example, how he valued as key the effort of accessing the best books which sets right away the challenging of knowing which are the best books. We should keep in mind too that Brian's team had been accepted by YCombinator, which was already considered in Silicon Valley as a top-tier network of knowleged, and the path that his team went through, being supported by networks from top VC firms and investors like Reid Hoffman.

@outline - Marcio's goggles

When Marcio had insight and told Michael that the major problem was of a party, for what was nice, like flow. And not the denial to do the boring. So the doing the so good things led to use of energy in excess. Insigh of Marcio - "Thank you Michael. Your reply resonated so much with things in my head, concerns, sometimes not clear; it adds so much clarity. A few months ago, I had, virtually speaking, screamed — ah! It's that freaking party the problem. The party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course). The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow. "

Insight of Michael, not a public quote yet, that "Categorization --> clusters --> patterns --> priorities -- that's it exactly. Natural multi-taskers with a strong work ethic (that's what I hear in your opening above) can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them. That's a problem if you compound the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time. Thank you for the note. It's very helpful to see through your goggles."

Another aspect goes straight to the discovery of the next stage. As one is experimenting with ideas, thus of course it should be recognized hands on projects, still the entrepreneur is also openning herself to the validating the system to be in place for the world ahead which of course synchronizes with values but should not be lock in a form or another. This very approach to what is being done opens a reflective model of management for the startup which seeks to validate or "to recruit" allies which are resources that signal, or funds, larger experiments and at the same time the evaluation of the larger goal. 

The identified component of the playbook becomes the exercise of value, as it has its built in mechanism for objectives evaluation. In the course of Harrison Metal, entitled General Management 2, Michael elaborates on principles for managing execution that takes in consideration that objectives can be both strong and weak. Strong in the sense of values, from the perspective of the objectives that gives motivation for movement, strong in the sense of the wider view that allows rooms for failure, for adaptation, for a conscious view for going from small and into growth. And weak, or better, humble, is the flexibility of evaluation that recognizes that the activities we pick, the key results we aim for, are at the same time closing a gap but also lifting ideas, understanding, evaluation, of the objective itself. Thus, one in a mission for a startup is automatically one in a mission for new management which requires a humble component that accepts that the objective,or the larger objective, is being discovered.

Reid Hoffman recognizes a style of management, and for that he refers to the work of Fred Kofmann [^footnote_conscious_business], of a compassionated view that transcends the individual needs and wants. The example he points uses the organization of an hospital to illustrate the point from the book of Fred, Conscious Business:  

[^footnote_conscious_business]: 

> *"Take for example doctors working on patients. And you say, 'this doctor is not doing the job well'. Well, when you get them out of the building, you are actually being hugely compassionate to patients."* (Hoffman, 2017, 50:14)

Although this principle of management is illustrated as operational in an organization, for the startup that is not only a reminder for situations in the past but has a significance in terms of principles applicable at all times, especially going through stages of successes. One which essentially set us into the exercise, that asks us to transcend from the present views, and into allowing the view from the group, or the higher-order larger viewpoint. 

In other words, the principle tell us to keep ourselves open, and embracing the compassionate level for the organization in development, in the future, which should set us to recognize present needs for adaptation which is different from forming conclusions in retrospect only after we are totally sure that something has gone wrong. The driver that only learns after analysis in retrospect - logically better than no analysis at all - looses the humble viewpoint that keeps her from the opportunity to see the road from above.

@outline - Challenging starts from within, open to listen, the problem of dictatorship.

Now a problem yet remains open, especially in the setting of apparently growing startups where a lot of movement happens to be highly influenced by the leadership is strong. How come to see from different goggles? Thus even if knowing of a compassionate viewpoint needed, for others existing or other views for for the business in the future, requires a first movement, the self to listen, to be open, in the first place. The way that Michael Dearing set us to be open is by first making a point that our superpowers come with a price to pay: 

> *"Human beings have a knack for observing, forming judgments, and taking action. When you state it like this it seems pretty linear and rational, whether you’re talking about individuals or people working in teams. Cognitive behavior theory says automatic thoughts color and distort our observations, our judgments, and our actions."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

--> 

Which comes with a good news - especially for the moments when we believe we are static and responding with a formed identity - where Michael does see the leaders in us as able to change their goggles, which goes along with the supporting points from cognitive behavioral theory from Aaron Beck: 

> *"Beck’s theory of cognitive behavior described how observations, judgments, and actions are tinted and changed by automatic thoughts. These automatic thoughts come to mind without even trying. They reflect deep beliefs about self, past experiences, and expectations for the future, and they have a profound impact on judgment and behavior."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

I would tease you into that theme with the thinking that "if you are too fast doing it, consider how fast you are in assuming that you are what you are." But of course the power of superpowers will always set the hero to miss the perspective by its own style of movement. That because, they can be great, fast and slow. From a perspective, for now, it may be then uncomfortable - such as what we feel if we account one in a position of superpower to recognize a negative side, or a half-empty glass.

@outline - Example, supporting, afraid identity leader 
-->

As example of supporting views that can be created to the self, we may consider the power of support and the challenge of support. The insight from a research cited by *Are You Afraid to Identify as a Leader?* (2022), has shown how hard we can be influenced by our views, who we are, the identity we feel we must hold, and how weak all of that can be given that a special supportinng view sets a new perspective for these identities. I think that the exercice greatly reconciles some of our reflections as for our identities with our fears: 

> "In one study, we found that participants who listened to a podcast in which we framed leadership as risky were less likely to identify or act as leaders than those who listened to a podcast that described leadership as low-risk. This suggests that simply by presenting leadership as less risky and lower-stakes (for example, by clarifying that leadership mistakes are expected and will not be a black mark on an employee’s record), managers can help employees feel more comfortable seeing themselves as leaders." (Cunningham, Sonday, & Ashford, 2022)

--> 

In other words, it sounds quite scary that we can fear things after crafting our own identity as projected, tied, or pressured by the work situation, the startup situation. 

> *"At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Why would perceptions of riskiness influence something as deeply ingrained as your identity? From a psychological standpoint, however, this effect is not surprising at all. No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might think."* - (Cunningham, Sonday, & Ashford, 2022).

To conclude, in alighment with the compassionate view for our creating conditions for us to grow, we shall then celebrate an idea, which can well take us to be less uncomfortable and perhaps towards challenging our views more naturally. This is the view that ask us to be friends with the critic in ourselves. 

If we seek a friendly critic, we shall consider a somewhat cold critic eye on top of the performers that may at times be able to experiment, to play too. The whole idea of this cold supervisor may be about to be calmer, as opposed to applauding the kids too quick all the time and making a parade for their movements. He gives the leg, the arm, supports. But he or she is cold, keeps her child informed about potential risks too. Keeps the team aware. Thus to enable a path of less frustration but also helps in structuring the episode with more rigor and less bet, like thinking it will work out. This model of strategizing says that there is an overarching meta control - as if it were a premeditated battle where the outcome, positive or negative, is always positive, an experiment. This parent, growth educator, and therapeut coach, is there to support curiosity and to let the team to be calm with a good critic. The valley, call it the throgh of sorrow or the valley of confusion, is valley of opportunity, is where life rises, is where the team can be enlightened. The path is the solution. 

Of course, especially for the case of writers but not limited, we should realize that intermediary conflict celebrate its existence as in respecting and noticing when that creative doer fights with our know-it-all critic. Indeed, these personalities are roles in the same room, especially in the beginning of professional journeys, where we engage in a fight and it looks like a struggle and it's a struggle that confuses us. The light, at the end of the tunnel, if we accept to see it, is an enlightened place where they can collaborate and as well said by Dorothea Brandy from *Becoming a Writer*. Dorothe Brand, in 1934, pulled that truth from her well, to tell yet-to-become writers about the peaceful place where these personalities do not have to attack each other in realtime. I think that this is applicable to the life of a writer, to the life of a developer writing code, to an individual going through projects and writing the narrative of their lives and their startups:  

> *"He has trained himself so that the physical effort of writing does not tire him out of all proportion to the effect he achieves. His intellect directs, criticizes, and discriminates whatever two possible courses present themselves in such a way as to leave the more sensitive elements of his nature free to bring forth its best fruit. He learns to use his intellect both cursively, as he works, and later, as he considers what he has done during the period of the creative flow. He replaces by conscious intention, and day by day, the drawings made on his fonts of images, sensations, and ideas by keeping awake to the observations. Ideally, the two sides of his nature are at peace with each other and work in harmony. At the least, he must be able to suppress one or other at discretion. Each side of his character must learn to be able to trust the other, to do what is in its field, and to carry the full responsibility for its own work. He restrains each side of his mind to its own functions, never allowing the conscious to usurp the privilege of the unconscious, and vice versa.*" Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)
