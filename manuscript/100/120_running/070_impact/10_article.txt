# Impact 





<!--
@outline - situation

Before we conclude part one, and given that we have celebrated characterizations of the founder - or the roles of the founder or the startup entity - in terms of a conscious execution, we should how the enlightened by an entrepreneurial action of the self is connected with the startup growth in ways that causes in impact in the world. This brings us to a particular curve [^footnote_michaeldearing_lectures_curve], one in which Silicon Valley investor Michael Dearing calls his favorite curve, one which he can't resist to bring up when in the beginning of many of lectures. Michael is thankful to professor Delong from Berkeley for coming up with that nice curve. It's a graph that shows the GDP per capita, through time, from One Million B.C. to the present [^footnote_braddelong_graph_curve]. In addition, he chops off the period between 1 million B.C. and 1000 (Dearing, M., 2018, 1:58), concluding that nothing special were happening. Now, as for what is left for consideration, and before celebrating the exciting period, Michael reminds us about the particular period around the 1eth century when our productivity dropped badly, the plague: 

[^footnote_michaeldearing_lectures_curve]: Michael's favorite curve can be seen in at least three of his talks: *Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction* (Greylock, 2015), *Two Blasts from the Past* (Spero Ventures, 2018), *Executive Communication* (Heavybit, 2019). 

[^footnote_braddelong_graph_curve]: Michael's favorite graph refers to the work of professor Brad Delong. You can see comments about his graph from https://www.bradford-delong.com/2014/05/estimates-of-world-gdp-one-million-bc-present-1998-my-view-as-of-1998-the-honest-broker-for-the-week-of-may-24-2014.html

Leaving that dark period in the past, things started to look different through the industrial revolution, with the world's producvitity growth which kept on growing, growing fast. Any resemblance with the hockey-stick-like exponential image is not a mere coincidence. Michael points too that many things had happened and are happening, good and bad things. But to the point, he points, or prompt us to reflect, about how that the curve pays for everything. If I accept the challenge, from the many thoughts about how it pays, when I try to extract a sort of "small version" of the curve applicaple to our lives, a parallel which can be observable, I think of a mother who offers safety to her baby in the first place, and then she supports the movement, a little exploration, far from her leg and then awaits her back to her arms. Or perhaps the angel investor who joins the startup boat, and gives support offering resources and perspectives, or protection to the future of the business, enabling them to learn or to do that exploratory work, and welcoming back the team for the sake of growth. Or I can remember too some of the considerations we have seen from the chapter Environment, given by the rise of platforms like after the iPhone which enabled app-based ride-sharing experiences that had changed transportation.

* @prior - 1 - In Foreword, World, Creative Destruction in the foreword - "These solutions, much of it materialized as mechanical solutions, were fruits of human work and collaboration at the epicenter of a destruction to an economic order heavily based on slavery. The rising new economic model were supported by technological innovations that redefined rules of labor force that went along with societal changes in the system and shaped a new economy. The situation in the United States, the north vs. south confrontation, illustrated the advancement of the new order and how it deconstructed a present economic order where slavery persisted. As these worlds collided, the industrial revolution defined the economic context that accelerated the destruction of the old economic system based on slavery and gave rise to a new system that brought freedom to certain extent or innovation. This new pace, a new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come." 

* @prior - 2 - In Accounting  - Not really defined Creative Destruction. Consider to take out? Reduce? @Accounting:"Now has Schumpeter misunderstood the entrepreneur reducing it as the pure doer? No, I would think, exactly because of a premisse that the incessant doer brings about freedom from the current stream, from the way things are done. It other words it is plausiable to think that doing leads to reinvention just like writing every day leads to clear writing. But the very twist lies in the fact that the incessant doer does it by getting things done in ways that breaks stability, or the norm, because if not the acceptance of the equilibrium may also mean that there is not nothing to be done anyway. The view from this perspective, that getting things done means changing the environment, allow us to consider the very Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction although applicable to the individual that does it: the situation that when they see it, and when they feel empowered to act on it, involves them challenge themselves, their conforming selves, the one that would not do anything at all about what frustrates them. In other words, the doer that breaks the norm follows from the necessary challenging of their position of inaction, thus challenging her own status quo, which provokes to bring about change to themselves in the first place and by that they hope to do the same to the external environment, minimally provoking the outside with stories, if not with the materializations of things that carry on their stories further."

* @prior - 3 - In Environment, in a footnote - "[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can create the conditions for an entrepreneurial function that is obsolete; which may be observable in part if we consider that many people think they are entrepreneurs while they might be building something too simple from the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction or to be considered as business as usual.

Now we like it or not, that curve is on our way; thus we might listen to signals since we are into it in a quest for impact. One key point might be a catch with the curve - as in a thing in it which may take us to take things for granted. On the surface, we certain see that exponential rise of productivity, that indeed does pay for everything. Now as for the unseen element, we should acknowledge the implied process of destruction that is not generally accounted by the first impression. This is so because what gets accounted is the sum of the output as told, as history tells, which goes well with our intents and how stories are told - we do account by using the metrics of our days. Nevertheless, these can be the hidden efforts, or the negative additions,  which is unfair to call them negative to start with exaclty because we know that our failures, our mistakes, are in fact the thing that take us to learn, to be creative, to to reinvent, then to come back to the positive. Back to the macro chart, the idea is carried by a process know of Creative Destruction [^footnote_schumpeter_creative_descruction] considered by Joseph Schumpeter.

[^footnote_schumpeter_creative_descruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development. 












## For growth

Now, this brief check on that big curve is important because the movement of it - think of a little push towards the exponential growth - does so because of these certain entities that acts in the entrepreneurial ways. From the industrial revolution days an interesting push, the mill industry in US, shows ties with efforts from entrepreneurs like Oliver Evans. Now for us in the modern days the startup is seen as an entity that does that, so we should bring back the definition from Paul Graham - the one we brought in the introduction - where startup equals to growth:

PG accross chapters - Marcio have copied a quote from Paul Graham that was way ahead, in chapter 3, to now; because it needs to be evident, from the beginning of the book, that growth is the situation we are talking; this creates a match with the audience. Moreover, we need to make sure that the audience gets to this point with a full awareness of the growth situation. @meta-refid 1212-3212-3328-3834

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth."* (Graham, 2012)

This time, however, we should talk about that word, "fast," to contextualize a point given that a quick reading can take us away from key insights that can't be missed from reading Paul Graham. In *Startup = Growth* (2012), he approaches that theme, talks about the rate of growth, setting us to see the relativeness of the movement:

> *"So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a startup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have. For founders that's more than a theoretical question, because it's equivalent to asking if they're on the right path." (Graham, Paul., 2012)
 
It provokes the self-conscious process within the process. It may be unfair to say that it it calls for some slowness but to see this ways help me to at least regulate the rushness. Now this observation sets a link between the founder, the startup, and the growth curve; because it considers the materialization of the startup - as a business within the relative motion of the whole growth. It considers the sustainable condition in the face of the relative motion of the world, which in colorful ways I can think of a startup that puts a dent in the universe, or call it whatever you want, or we can see that it has values being produced in ways that it sustains itself, as a business through time. This gives us an initial structure if we're thinking about impact, one that can be visualized with the support from the Blitzscaling lectures, given that Reid Hoffman kept on wondering about characterizations both in terms of structure, logic, and the challenges. From many views, one in special is a response from the interview with Michael Dearing:

> *"First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to, hopefully God willing, turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)

@outline - Recognition of the challenging from being successful and leaving the perspective for scale. 
--> 

This is solid, and structured, and challenging. And not different from what we did reflecting about fast, we should too look to contextualize the word God. This is Michael implicitly reminding ourselves of the complex situations, where we call God, such as through the stages of grief, therefore it's used exactly to contextualize that the trouble is not about shifting as in increasing the level of complexity; and it sets us as conductors to be involved into that is likely a major challenge. I like to frame it G.O.D., the Good Old Dilemma of entrepreneurship. Now if I proceed and use this structure as a requirement to our journey, I might as well use the principles of this book and look to these masters of scale and ask them to "hold your horses, right there," and wonder "are you telling me that I should be have amazing ideas, to be great in productizing, and then to be great it growing the business?" They're doing that, to a certain perspective; however, the nuanced observation may be a calling for us not to sums more views, or skills, or abilities, but one which provoke us to be better in releasing our views. Moreover, to engage with that as part of our jobs, to use time from management for that, to be conscious of this ability for the sake of being better in terms of changing, of understanding context. Therefore, certainly, it becomes even more challenging given that many of the actual too that the ways we enters this space generally involves an initial movement which has ties with elements like passions, or energy, and one's ability to do it with confidence, and related characterizations. 

Now a point that should be made here is that not all the kinds of investors will ask us to get involved with that. So, there is a category of investors, which I like to think of the kinds that enters the boat with you, that don't think that you are expendable. They really want from you and from us to be involved throughout the stages. In other words, they want us to be around. This is the case of the angel investor Jason Calacanis [^footnote_jasoncalacanis_reactive]. When asked about biggest mistake founders make, he were concerned with their focus when they do it in ways comparable with being maniacs: They enter in a reactionary mode, responding to emails, tweets, and openning tickets in whatever project management system they like. We get into the business of putting out fires and don't reconsider the risky place we set ourselves in, in the first place: 

[^footnote_jasoncalacanis_reactive]: Jason Calacanis is an American entrepreneur, angel investor, and author known for his investments in various tech startups and his role in the podcasting and media industry. He is the founder of several companies, including Mahalo.com, Inside.com, and the podcast "This Week in Startups." In this talk (Calacanis, Jason., 2017) Jason reminds founders of the perils of their movement which he referred as reactionary.

> *"What founders don't realize is that in a lot of times what you need is down time, and space in your brain, for ideas, and for revelations and for insights to happen."* (Calacanis, Jason., 2017, 3:10)

Yet, as we know, we can grasp these ideas in theory. But we know too that nothing is like when we are right there living the feeling of what happens, especially in the middle of what appears to be doing it well. To consider balancing out, if that could be considered at all, feels uncomfortable, or it feels unproductive. And when we hear points like to wait for a revelation, that pulls an instant picture of us, under our called objective lenses, which we materialize that picture in a frame - we don't look like real doers, or productive workers. This feeling of discomfort is a subject for us worth reflecting. Why is it that we set ourselves and feel that discomfort which may seem not as the state of happiness? 

We have considered the feeling of what happens, in part, in the prior chapter, for example when we approached the theme of fears in front of moments of change, like the *Raw Fear* which Doug Leone mentioned to express what moves him and which sets him and his VC firm to reinvent itself. Or the fears associated with loss - and stages of grief - brought by Mr. Andy Grove referred as *The Valley of Death* to explain the challenges of leadership that undergoes the inflection points in front of the 10x force, before the commitments to reign in chaos. For the start-up situation, in particular, we considered the painful or confusing situation through the *Trough of Sorrow*, brought by top-tier investor-advisors Paul Graham and Andrew Chen, asking us to be patient right there in the face of the actual realization of lost battles preventing us to see how the real learning grows. Now unlike these situations, the structure which Michael refers as "different set of pursuits" we will certainly tap on our fears which may prevent us to engage potentially taking us into the straight movement of denial, and or of the use of our time to engage with the matters - as in unknown or undesired matters. In all these situations, there is something being said, there is certainly needs for adaptability, that's why it's certainly important to celebrate the situation as not the end of the world but as part of the process, which is what these masters of scale are asking us.

For the next sections, we will celebrate first an experience of transformation of a hero from history, a blast from the past; a story that may take us to reflect about the ways to scale ourselves. And we shall conclude with thoughts about healthy ways to be comfortable with these challenges of change.

* James Green on improving tolerance for ambiguity - "To understand your own tolerance for ambiguity, consider your comfort with uncertainty, with change, and with unfamiliar situations. Think about how you can improve your tolerance through experience. As you experience new things, the next time that you experience them, they’re not new. You have new know-how. You have new capabilities that you’ve established. You have new insights, new relationships, and new resource for next time. Trying new things beyond your comfort zone, professionally and personally, is a good way to develop your tolerance for ambiguity." (Green, James., p. 36, )
