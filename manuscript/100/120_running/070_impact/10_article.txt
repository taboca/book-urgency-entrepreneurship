Silicon Valley investor Michael Dearing, of Harrison Metal, consistently starts his special talks - such as *Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction* (Greylock, 2015) and *Two Blasts from the Past* (Spero Ventures, 2018) and *Executive Communication* (Heavybit, 2019) - showing a curve. And he always says that that  is his favorite curve. And he always say thanks to professor Brad Delong, from Berkeley, for setting up that nice curve. It's a graph that shows the GDP per capita, through time, from One Million B.C. to the present [^footnote_braddelong_graph_curve]. In addition, Michael chops off the period between 1 million B.C. and 1000, concluding that he didn't find anything good happening. (Dearing, Michael., 2018, 1:58)

In one of his lectures, Michael reminds us about a particular period from that part of the history when productivity dropped badly - around the 13th century, the plague: 

> *"In case you ever do build a time machine, please do not put the settings to that [period] because you'll have a one in three chance of not coming home. The population drop was precipitous, particularly in Europe. And so the productivity, really what GDP per capita is, collapsed."* (Dearing, 2015, 3:42)

But he moves on into the interesting period, which happend from the industrial revolution, where the the curve started to grow, and went on growing fast. His remarks that that through that manhy good or bad things were happening. But to his point, he points that the curve does pays for everything. Now that curve, we like it or not, is part of the path of founders. Things from that curve will affect what we do so perhaps tha curve has a lot to tell us.One thing it tell us is that we are in a space that is quite active, where things are happening fast, and where things can be quite heated. The curve also set us to consider that the many things that can be done can be done by using the resources and ideas from others. 

Now there is a catch with the curve although it is not a message encrusted in i but can be something we may think of the curve if we look too fast. And it may be so because one looking fast may think that the curve pays for everything - that our prior movement of success may actually pay for what comes next. Oh, well, this is true, isn't it? There is a truth in it, we know that it is from a prior condition of success that we can seek more. But we shouldn't miss the subtle truth that is intrinsic and which sustains growth. It is that the curve may hide the destruction process required to grow. In other words, what gets accounted, visualilly, gets to be a sum exaclty because history tells the stories of success just like accounting generally accounts the gross output, not the negative, not always the learning lessons, does not entirely shows what it takes for growh to happen. 

Here, as we consider impact, we are onto something. We are onto considering the curve of the self that respects the self, our teams, as resources which are not expendable - as we have considered in the first chapter entitled Accounting. Implictly, we are going to celebrate that we in order to grow, and to move accross, we must see that our prior successes should give us a playbook that is not static. If we follow our success curve, by pouring resources we have acquired, and the knowledge as we know, from the perspective and the goggles we wear, no matter how successful we are that movement will only set ourselves to be out of the way of the curve ahead. In other words, the curve of growth does not care and if we do not follow through, by creatively reinventing ourselves through the path, the curve will capture the value from what we did effort and make dust out of us. This is so because the curve is a self-cleaning oven. Thus, once we are that heated oven, we set ourselves fresh again or we are grilled to the point of being carbon. 

With that considered, the good news is that the success that we acquire by our movements, will sum up to ourselves. But as it sums up, we can't neglect the opportunity to use the time - as the success happens - to grow, to acquire the perspective. Let us dive into the reflection that may help us into that zone of impact. First, let us consider the setting we are - running startups as entities to grow and and living the challenges of change as individuals moving through the stages. Then we will reflect about a model for scaling that works for the individual, teams, and startups. And finally we will consider the importance of being friendly with that challenging growth path.

We are somehow programmed and it seems that it took us to where we are that we trust the things that works. With the only problem is that we do not know what works better which take us to not trust our true potential.  Having considered that, I shall also say that I we shouldn't honour our the good side of that. That if any potential trap happens to be configured, if might do so because we happen to trust an engine that works. In other words, that our operating system is donig what it were programmed to do, to seek for improved efficiency given our goals; the engine that allow us to measure the feedback and to conceptualize from the experiential action and account values and that by the evaluations of our behaviors we then may encounter, only in retrospect, ourselves fultilling our own prophecies or to take what happens more lightly to be essentially scoring how we are doing under the goal to be moving in the right direction. As for the good things, I would assume that those could be estrapolated from the flipside of this chapter and the abundance of materials, the exact environment around that is always ready to tease us to keep feeding our beasts. 

But now the concerns of this chapter are valid - the flipside of the successful doer the moment that they become - it is because we are essentially trying to save ourselves from the traps of being over-focused in one or other perspective, under the hope that we can embrace perspectives that can save us from trouble; especially in the face of the growth situation of their startups as we have considered in a prior chapter, the things which are excepted of a startup; the situation as supported by Paul Graham:

Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth.

So there I am, when I read that, I somehow trust too fast what works to think of the startup that grows fast is a startup that is faster to anything. This is not what Paul is reminding us. He is referring to the hypothetical one that *grows* fast.

In a previous chapter, in the section *Infinite Apprentice*, we have considered some reflections from Brian Chesky and Reid Hoffman, an idea of the infinite learner which was key to solve the growth complication of entrepreneurship which as framed by Reid sets us to recognize that "what got you here won't get you there." Brian's opinion was that through the stages of growth one is not in it to become skilled in a sport. Instead, one has to enjoy and get into a whole new sport. 

But of course, some other considerations must be embraced if we are to use the situation of Brian. We should take in the consideration the context which he were in. Consider, for example, how he valued as key the effort of accessing the best books which sets right away the challenging of knowing which are the best books. We should keep in mind too that Brian's team had been accepted by YCombinator, which was already considered in Silicon Valley as a top-tier network of knowleged, and the path that his team went through, being supported by networks from top VC firms and investors like Reid Hoffman.

--> 






Now, the celebration of that truth in entrepreneurship unlocks a complication. That is what means there and the how to get there? And it becomes quite complicated because if the team is small, consider that many startups started with one before the other, and especially if vision - or love or passion or you name it - is present, it is naturally expected a kind of vision that creates a roadmap for the there which naturally pushes them to gamble since "what got you here won't get you there" reveals that they might be in seeking the objective as much as the how to get to the objective. Thus the complication prompts us to find what is the key that unlocks the self into being open so that to be aware, to embrace the unknown, such as developing ways to balancing the activities, for what it takes to get to there, to which only really after the movement happens one can truly say, in retrospect, how to get there. To solve the problem, which is likely impossible from the view of the executor of now, we might consider to resort in developing a humble view for what happens. Would that solve? It may be a good advice as in for us to carry on an extra eye, watching ourselves.  The second aspect, after the recognition of the condition, involves being compassionate with your other self, the self that does not know, the self that is the only self that can let you escape from the self, the one which enters the space of learning, or the state of bring an apprentice. 




There are a lot of enlightened formulations that are giving us the understanding and colors to the challenging situation of being a leader when the startup goes through growth. Throughout the Blitzscaling lectures, Reid Hoffman kept on focusing on essentially asking most of the interviewed leaders about the challenges of scaling but making sure to focus in the challenges from the perspective of the leader that essentially is going through "what got you here is not what will get you there."[^footnote_blizscaling_brianchesky_got_you_there] To point an example consider the how Michael Dearing prioritized talking about the challenges of the growth phases when Reid asked how founders can evaluate themselves as founders:

[^footnote_blizscaling_brianchesky_got_you_there]: In Blitzscaling lecture number 18 (2015), Reid Hoffman asked Brian about the challenges of being a leader when the startup is going through the growth stages of Blitzscaling; to which Brian pointed out first about the absence of guidance for these transitions, stressing that leaders must evolve their perspective because the situation demands a whole new mindset as if the leader is being exposed to a whole new sport on every phase.

> *"First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to, hopefully God willing, turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)

The inescapable truth from looking from above, the whole situation of the startup exists on one hand, and on the other hand, the growth situation for the founder and the leadership team should go along with. And naturally, it is implied that if we don't know where we're going - not exactly and not entirely and nor the means to make that growth happen - then we are essentially navigating a space by doing from our position of learning - and the implied establishment of perspectives - given that we are seeking outcomes; which set us to then be concerned with provoking our views with real views such as the views of how market will respond. 

In other words, this is essentially about being into the art and science in the sense that any innocent or naïve or visionary creation is essentially being subject to refinement. So naturally, the characterization of this evolution can be evidenced by the interactions - with partners and advisors and mentors and investors and customers and users and other perspectives given by entities of many kinds - and the understanding of the domain or the philosophical inference of the transformation that is being proposed. That's an essential truth. 

Moreover, it is implied too from such truth that any of us are well equipped to engage with the interactions with the external environment in order to seek for answers - cofounders, advisors, mentors, and more - but still, and under the perspective of the concerns of this chapter, we should recognize that such attempt to seek for answers can be pointless if one is not to a certain extent interested in being a learner and in challenging themselves in the first place. Of course, because the end measure is not just the interaction with the external. That doesn't solve anything. The measure needs to be a serious commitment with the idea of seeking beyond plain answers and of the order of acquiring a new perspective; or to challenge our views. 

Furthermore, if we find ourselves inclined to accept listening and seeking out new views to our perspectives, that shall well be a construction and allowance that we set to ourselves. In other words, it comes too from inside of us - which is not so different from the internal movement and what it takes for a person to go seek a psychologist or a mentor or an advisor for any subject.

But of course, we understand too - from our culture and fast-paced inclination to fix things after the fact - that we are generally induced to keep on learning in retrospect - after we knock our aheads - which is why we shall close this chapter with a few more celebrations about the challenges of change or the challenges of challenging ourselves. 



















#### A2 - Responsibility and scale 

<!-- 
@meta @todo 
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Part 2 - In Searching Impact - there is a whole section entitled "The guardian" which seems as a good introduction to the chapter "The feedback of urgency". Ref 9884-8944-9492-9044 #duplicated #crossreference 
--> 

There exists a compelling force that can lead us to pack our schedules—a result of the belief that more work yields greater outcomes. This force calls for increased production or enhanced efficiency for ongoing activities. Such a drive towards productivity is natural, as entrepreneurial actions are also guided by the feedback from outcomes. However, the challenge lies in discerning which type of feedback to heed and recognizing the need to engage across the various fronts of a business. Focusing solely on product design, for example, fails to address the key issues vital for the growth and sustainability of the business.

This pressure becomes positive because entrepreneurs interpret signs of traction, which can manifest in various ways. A developer-entrepreneur, for instance, may feel effective in the process of design and product development, influencing his actions and the overall direction based on the belief that he is on the right path.

In another scenario, an entrepreneur might spend all their time addressing support tickets or extinguishing fires related to current customers, creating a barrier against seeing other strategic needs. The principle is simple—if something is working, just do more of the same, or "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." If the product continues to sell, then the solution seems to be just to replant the same, follow the same rules.

Yet, the issue with reactionary execution isn't always due to external pressure, like positive feedback (a market signal). Even amidst uncertainty, entrepreneurs suffer from this syndrome of execution and productivity, always ready to scale, always in a rush.

From identifying the problem, or syndrome, entrepreneurs must acknowledge their responsibility towards the other dimensions of their business. High productivity is good, but success in certain areas does not guarantee progress in others.

This syndrome puts the business at risk because of biases—thought patterns, habits, processes, or even cultural issues that govern the entrepreneur's actions. James Green, in his work "Opportunity Analysis Canvas" (2015), warns of a trait known as representativeness, which is the entrepreneurial tendency to trust what they hear and see in their immediate domain, relying on their previous knowledge, known data, their current customers, friends, etc.

It's common for entrepreneurs to stumble upon something right, or seemingly right, and craft their own narrative that justifies not only continuing to advance their business in the same manner but even to accelerate their plans without questioning them—assuming there is a plan at all. Others simply proceed with a "doing" mindset, hoping the part that works will offset the part that doesn't.

The real issue is advancing on various fronts without a clear understanding of what works and what doesn't. Worse, eventually, the functioning aspect is diluted by the failing side, turning special products mediocre, adding more and more options until the menu becomes bland.

A simplistic execution example is a pizzeria that starts with 10 flavors and, after a few years of consistently listening to its customers, ends up with 256 flavors, allowing customers to create their own pizzas.

The problem might be that entrepreneurs don't realize that even when things are going well, they need to continuously be in a state of learning and discovery. Moreover, they need to be more critical and not just keep adding on, like someone who uses too many nails to hang a picture.

Most businesses today are likely in a continuous state of discovery, which is a challenge deserving attention because the tendency is towards specialized action, usually involving trying to scale or meet demands in an attempt to improve the situation from a performance standpoint or by adding more work. Rarely does the pizzeria entrepreneur consider removing items from the menu.

Thus, entrepreneurs add more products to the shelves, launch more campaigns, hire more staff, negotiate better with their suppliers—in short, they do more activities with the idea that more is better. More promotions, more services, more products, more customers, etc.

Worse, when their actions show traction, the consequence is inevitable. They operate in reactive mode. According to investor Jason Calacanis (This Week in Startups, 2017, 3:04), the biggest mistake founders make is that they become maniacs. They enter a reactionary mode, responding to emails, tweets, and open tickets in their own project management systems. In other words, these entrepreneurs get used to putting out fires and don't reconsider the risk conditions they've set in the first place. For Jason, they fail to realize that sometimes they need to stop and make space in their minds for ideas, revelations, and insights.

This reactionary execution essentially tells the entrepreneur to do more of the same, or more of what comes from the same source. So, if they've built relationships with customers who don't pay on time, it becomes normal to continue respecting this vicious cycle and accelerate actions that try to remedy the delays, rather than revisiting the entire history that would prevent them.

When Marcio had insight and told Michael that the major problem was of a party, for what was nice, like flow. And not the denial to do the boring. So the doing the so good things led to use of energy in excess. Insigh of Marcio - "Thank you Michael. Your reply resonated so much with things in my head, concerns, sometimes not clear; it adds so much clarity. A few months ago, I had, virtually speaking, screamed — ah! It's that freaking party the problem. The party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course). The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow. "

Insight of Michael, not a public quote yet, that "Categorization --> clusters --> patterns --> priorities -- that's it exactly. Natural multi-taskers with a strong work ethic (that's what I hear in your opening above) can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them. That's a problem if you compound the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time. Thank you for the note. It's very helpful to see through your goggles."

In the path to solve the entrepreneurial's dilemma, which can be paradox, I ask us to consider what I call the *Minty-Tubman Growth Path*, as just a way for us to carry the quest to understand the transformation of Harriet Tubman - The Moses of Her People - rising from her past self, the enslaved Minty, Araminta Ross. In this ride we will be conduced by Michael Dearing as he had the interest in Harriet's story and drew good insights from that proposing a scaling model that supports growth of startups their teams and founders. 

The first thing to be observed, which matters for anyone in the business of getting things done but more important for startups, is the recognition that the startup exists to grow and to grow in a world that is embracing a change. The setting of a better world is a good one because it sets us to be energized. With that, it follows too the recognition of the supporting forces. Back to the days of Harriet, we could over simplify that there were certain forces from the North - forces supporting freedom and end of slavery - and on the other hand the forces from the South - forces supporting the situation as it were. 

Michael's observations, in retrospect and based his history research and analysis, he had identified characterizations of Harriet's actions taking herself to ride along the movement of freeing enslaved people which required her to grow. He maps the steps. 


<!--
@meta @todo 
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Impact - Check Michael's GM2 objective definition with Harriet's model - Harriet's objective, although not clear from the beginning, goes inline with Michael's GM2 definition of what what is an objective: consistent with your values, reflects your first principles, world-view, generates pride, sense of accomplishment. 
--> 

First, the identificatin of her values. Her movement to free herself can be seen as a key result but of course not the ultimate outcome she wanted - it showed a connection with wish for freedom for enslaved people. As she escaped she had tested a model, and from that she saved her friends and family so all of that can be simplified now as herself exercising her values. Thus she found a model from her successes and, from that, according to Michael's second point, she exercised "quick wins building trust" and from that "recruiting allies and building a network." 

To celebrate her improvement of methods, and access to that scaling power, Michael in *Two Blasts from the Past* (2018) highlights a period around "about ten years after she had really seized her own freedom," when she became a favorite secret agent for the North. The following is a letter, which she carried in the pocket, which meant free pass in terms of transport, ability to buy supplies, and more. The letter was signed by David Hunter, a Union general and represented one of many acts of trust and support to her mission as she were at this point building a strong network of information and gathering information: 

> *"Pass the bearer, Harriet Tubman, to Beaufort and back to this place, and wherever she wishes to go; and give her free passage at all times, on all Government transports. Harriet was sent to me from Boston by Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, and is a valuable woman. She has permission, as a servant of the Government, to purchase such provisions from the Commissary as she may need."* (Bradford, 2018, p. XX).

In other words, she were growing as one of the conductors of the Underground Railroad [^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad], a secret organization responsible for freeing slaves during the times of the American Civil War. In a nutshell, at the risk of being nuts to oversimplify, she were the bearer of herself from being a little grain in a shell into becoming a pearl and to be known as the *Moses of Her People*. And she kept on doing it, even after the Civil War, helping people to become entrepreneurs. 

[^footnote_wikipedia_undergroundrailroad]: The Underground Railroad was a secret network of routes and safe houses used by enslaved African Americans to escape to free states and Canada with the help of abolitionists and allies. This clandestine effort was most active during the early to mid-19th century, leading up to the American Civil War.

The story of Harriet became for Michael a landscape for a reflect about the challenges of scaling. He came up with a map (2018, 12:42) for when teams are small leading them to get bigger. Starting with the small, we use our energy and check with our values. Achieve quick wins, you are build trust. Recruit allies, you are building your network. Michael pointed out that "she took what she knew and she taught other people how to be good conductors on the road," which meant she were crafting a play book. The outcome was that she were making small batches of sucesses, she were iterating. When bigger, the first step again which now turns her self energy and her values translated as other people's energy, people who shared the same values. Michael reminds us that Harriet was trusted with other people's resources and skills, that she were walking aroung with the equivalent of a year's salary of a senior officer. With that stronger trust network, she could approach supporters now with bolder ideas which in normal circumstances could be seen as crazy and unrealistic. Through the growth iteratins, "her networks became quite literally armies." And she kept on iterating the playbook, in other words, passing on the playbook. 

This model, is for Michael how startups should be scaling. He too sets a provocation, for founders and their teams,asks for a reflection, about when the gas is available, how eager founders go into pouring their resources while they aren't quite ready for it. What Michael is taking us is an opportunity to reconcicle with something we have celebrated before - a thinking from Reid Hoffman which he refers to it as the challenge of growth and where essentially "what brought you here is not what takes you there." [^editornote_reid_stages].

The identification of values shows a good startint point for founders. Exactly because in many endeavours that people get into, they might right there have not a clear picture of values. Thus, it becomes vital for any entrepreneur to use time in this regard - work time. And it is not that founders's envisioned project don't have values - a lot of projects created with passion, and vision, actually connect with strong values. It is just that the energy to make the project real sometimes, can hide values that could also improve the founder's chances towards freeing themselves. When lacking values analysis, they can lock themselves and even bring premature ends to what they do. The search for values is then a great exercise that opens the realm of possibilities beyond one or another current project, experiment or activity that is being undertaken. 

Another aspect goes straight to the discovery of the next stage. As one is experimenting with ideas, thus of course it should be recognized hands on projects, still the entrepreneur is also openning herself to the validating the system to be in place for the world ahead which of course synchronizes with values but should not be lock in a form or another. This very approach to what is being done opens a reflective model of management for the startup which seeks to validate or "to recruit" allies which are resources that signal, or funds, larger experiments and at the same time the evaluation of the larger goal. 

The identified component of the playbook becomes the exercise of value, as it has its built in mechanism for objectives evaluation. In the course of Harrison Metal, entitled General Management 2, Michael elaborates on principles for managing execution that takes in consideration that objectives can be both strong and weak. Strong in the sense of values, from the perspective of the objectives that gives motivation for movement, strong in the sense of the wider view that allows rooms for failure, for adaptation, for a conscious view for going from small and into growth. And weak, or better, humble, is the flexibility of evaluation that recognizes that the activities we pick, the key results we aim for, are at the same time closing a gap but also lifting ideas, understanding, evaluation, of the objective itself. Thus, one in a mission for a startup is automatically one in a mission for new management which requires a humble component that accepts that the objective,or the larger objective, is being discovered.

Reid Hoffman recognizes a style of management, and for that he refers to the work of Fred Kofmann [^footnote_conscious_business], of a compassionated view that transcends the individual needs and wants. The example he points uses the organization of an hospital to illustrate the point from the book of Fred, Conscious Business:  

[^footnote_conscious_business]: 

> *"Take for example doctors working on patients. And you say, 'this doctor is not doing the job well'. Well, when you get them out of the building, you are actually being hugely compassionate to patients."* (Hoffman, 2017, 50:14)

Although this principle of management is ease to visualize as operational in an organization, is becomes applicable to the startup in the sense that individuals are likely involved in a dynamic role, although one that - as we have discussed - might not be aware about other important things at other abstract levels. Thus any exercise that transcends the views of an individual bring bring up the possibility of a managerial role that is conscious for the larger organization - even if the larger organization does not entire exist.   

In other words, by embracing compassion for the organization in development, we bring in the notion that recognizes failure and adaptation as dependend on prior movement, more than to be formed by conclusions in retrospect. The driver that only learns after analysis in retrospect - logically better than no analysis at all - looses the humble viewpoint that can keep their consciousness for the business open.

@outline - moving towards perhaps an enemy?

Now, to close, and going back to thoughts from Michael Dearing, I would like to celebrate this calling where he is inviting founders to be aware of their behaviors, especially given the space where we can be pressured to execute, that calling that we may do what we do and may do it too in love with what we do:  

> *"Human beings have a knack for observing, forming judgments, and taking action. When you state it like this it seems pretty linear and rational, whether you’re talking about individuals or people working in teams. Cognitive behavior theory says automatic thoughts color and distort our observations, our judgments, and our actions."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

--> 

As Michael had looked at the work of Aaron Beck - cognitive behavior theory - he had found something for us to do about ourselves instead of letting us do what we do as if we were static, as if we were just a personality that fits or not in a position:

> *"Beck’s theory of cognitive behavior described how observations, judgments, and actions are tinted and changed by automatic thoughts. These automatic thoughts come to mind without even trying. They reflect deep beliefs about self, past experiences, and expectations for the future, and they have a profound impact on judgment and behavior."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

If I couldn't link to the article, I would summarize the above as "if we are too fast to do, consider how fast you are in assuming that you are what you are." But, I can link and I strongly invite you to read Michael's article because it will set us in a new place, to gain a perspective such as that a lot of superpowers of founders can be seen from a different perspective, such as to be distortions and that they can be constructed. It may indeed be uncomfortable - such as to account as well that to be calling a superpower is just the perspective of one that is in the hurry and does not have time to see the half empty glass - but I take that it is a happy news for us that we can gain a perspective from cognitive behavior theory and to know that we are essentially  nurturing ourselves and that while we may generally think that we can't do much in terms of who we are - as in when we think that we would need to take a detour to treat our beings psychologically - it matters then even more to know that there are real things that we can do in terms of improving our behaviors and that to be concerned with that can be and should be part of management, the management of the self that is essential to lead the management of the whole.

@outline - Afraid identity leader 
-->

The insight from a research cited by "Are You Afraid to Identify as a Leader?, has shown that how challenge it is to support the developement of leaders as the consideration of a self-identity of a leader, has brought reputational concerns. As an example, employees might fear being seen as autocratic, different, or unqualified, when they consider themselves to embrace the role of leaders. Their research  suggests that organizations can impact the development of leaders and support a viewpoint that affects the psychological standpoint as taking leadership roles can be viewed as positive, and can be shown to be an area that is oriented to skills, and not as an innate ability: 

> "In one study, we found that participants who listened to a podcast in which we framed leadership as risky were less likely to identify or act as leaders than those who listened to a podcast that described leadership as low-risk. This suggests that simply by presenting leadership as less risky and lower-stakes (for example, by clarifying that leadership mistakes are expected and will not be a black mark on an employee’s record), managers can help employees feel more comfortable seeing themselves as leaders." https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Why would perceptions of riskiness influence something as deeply ingrained as your identity? From a psychological standpoint, however, this effect is not surprising at all. No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might think." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "And across our studies, we found that people who reported higher levels of fear around these reputational risks were less likely to see themselves as leaders. As a result, they were less likely to act as leaders, and therefore less likely to be seen as leaders by their supervisors." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

    @outline - Friendly critic (#autonomous #creative)
--> 

If we seek a friendly critic, we shall consider a somewhat cold critic eye on top of the performers that may at times be able to experiment, to play too. The whole idea of this cold supervisor may be about to be calmer, as opposed to applauding the kids too quick all the time and making a parade for their movements. He gives the leg, the arm, supports. But he or she is cold, keeps her child informed about potential risks too. Keeps the team aware. Thus to enable a path of less frustration but also helps in structuring the episode with more rigor and less bet, like thinking it will work out. This model of strategizing says that there is an overarching meta control - as if it were a premeditated battle where the outcome, positive or negative, is always positive, an experiment. This parent, growth educator, and therapeut coach, is there to support curiosity and to let the team to be calm with a good critic. The valley, call it the throgh of sorrow or the valley of confusion, is valley of opportunity, is where life rises, is where the team can be enlightened. The path is the solution.

@outline - friendly

Of course, especially for the case of writers but not limited, we should realize that intermediary conflict celebrate its existence as in respecting and noticing when that creative doer fights with our know-it-all critic. Indeed, these personalities are roles in the same room, especially in the beginning of professional journeys, where we engage in a fight and it looks like a struggle and it's a struggle that confuses us. The light, at the end of the tunnel, if we accept to see it, is an enlightened place where they can collaborate and as well said by Dorothea Brandy from *Becoming a Writer*. Dorothe Brand, in 1934, pulled that truth from her well, to tell yet-to-become writers about the peaceful place where these personalities do not have to attack each other in realtime. I think that this is applicable to the life of a writer, to the life of a developer writing code, to an individual going through projects and writing the narrative of their lives and their startups:  

> *"He has trained himself so that the physical effort of writing does not tire him out of all proportion to the effect he achieves. His intellect directs, criticizes, and discriminates whatever two possible courses present themselves in such a way as to leave the more sensitive elements of his nature free to bring forth its best fruit. He learns to use his intellect both cursively, as he works, and later, as he considers what he has done during the period of the creative flow. He replaces by conscious intention, and day by day, the drawings made on his fonts of images, sensations, and ideas by keeping awake to the observations. Ideally, the two sides of his nature are at peace with each other and work in harmony. At the least, he must be able to suppress one or other at discretion. Each side of his character must learn to be able to trust the other, to do what is in its field, and to carry the full responsibility for its own work. He restrains each side of his mind to its own functions, never allowing the conscious to usurp the privilege of the unconscious, and vice versa.*" Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)
