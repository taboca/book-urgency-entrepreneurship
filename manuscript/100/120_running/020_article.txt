# Running 



A point cannot be missed that the one who leads the startup challenges first-hand are in fact challenged to be learners and to evolve from the actual act of executing. We have celebrated that in the beginning of this book but another profound truth carried by this illustration suggests that all that happens - being a falling or rising or sliding through the tracks of the entrepreneurial rails or the work day - requires us to operate, to execute, in the first place.

So, here we have a requirement which we have covered in the first chapter on accounting which is the necessity of being somebody which comes before the possibility to become. In other words, our new somebody requires a being and a movement that enables the start-up to grow into a business. Essentially, this is allowing the rise of somebody else that escapes the existing perspectives that brought us to where we are and help us to get to where we want to be.

This is the starting point of this chapter, but it is also the starting point of any chapter of our lives, or our startups, or of our companies. We will celebrate, first, our ability to run and that we move from prior movement. Likely, and in alignment with the perspectives given by our walks, we shall consider the challenges given by our inclinations to run in front of the higher-order matter, what matterss, the growth ahead. In other words, and given that we recognize thart we need to be somebody in order to become somebody else - as we have celebrated in the first chapter - let us start by celebrating the spealized movement that set us into tracks - Can I play? I shall play. Can I run? I shall run. Can I learn? I shall learn. 

And then, we're gonna move on and reflect in alignment with the concerns from Reid Hoffman, which celebrates that what brought you here is not what takes you there, in this context, to reflect about our growth or defensive forces that regulates how we get involved, how we act in front of the new, in front of what takes us to learn or to adapt.
