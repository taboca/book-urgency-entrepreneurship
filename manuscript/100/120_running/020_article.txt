# Running 


There are many aspects of the life of a growing startup that aren't different from the life of a worker. Some of them can be extracted from a saying that Reid Hoffman carries to characterize the challenging situation of a founder who runs a startup, where essentially "you throw yourself off a cliff and you assemble an airplane on the way down" (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2013). 

His main point cannot be missed, that the one who lives the startup challenges first-hand are in fact challenged to be learners from the act of executing. We have celebrated that in the first chapter. But another profound truth carried by the illustration, suggests that all that happens, the falling or rising or sliding through the tracks of the workday, requires our ability to operate in the first place. In other words, the necessity of being somebody which comes before the possibility of ourselves to become, to turn ourselves into a new somebody, a somebody else needed to grow a startup into a business, a somebody else needed to escape the perspectives that brought us to where we are in ways to help to get to where we want to be.

This is the starting point for this chapter, as it is the starting point for any chapter of our lives or of our companies. We will celebrate, first, our ability to run and that we move from prior movement. Likely, and in alignment with the perspectives given by our walks, we shall consider the challenges given by our inclinations to run in front of the higher-order matter, what matterss, the growth ahead. In other words, and given that we recognize thart we need to be somebody in order to become somebody else - as we have celebrated in the first chapter - let us start by celebrating the spealized movement that set us into tracks - Can I play? I shall play. Can I run? I shall run. Can I learn? I shall learn. And, as move on, reflect in alignment with the concerns from Reid which celebrates that what brought you here is not what take you there.
