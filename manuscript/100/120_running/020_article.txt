# Running 

There is something about the lifecycle of a growing startup that is not different from the life of the worker. This relationship exists in the saying that Reid Hoffman carries to characterize some of the challenges of running a startup as where "you throw yourself off a cliff and you assemble an airplane on the way down" (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2013). Now, when I hear these words, I feel the pressure that time is short and that learning quick is a must. But if I pause that movement, a profound truth is implied and links the startup situation with the "startup of you," the life the worker: That all that we do, falling or rising or sliding in the tracks of the workday, originates from the starting point which is our ability to operate. In other words, only by being somebody we can take ourselves to becoming a new somebody, the somebody else that can grow the startup into a business, that escapes the perspectives of the means, known, to new means, knowing.

This is the starting point for this chapter, as it is the starting point for any chapter of our lives or of our companies. We will celebrate, first, our ability to run and that we move from prior movement. Likely, and in alignment with the perspectives given by our walks, we shall consider the challenges given by our inclinations to run in front of the higher-order matter, what matterss, the growth ahead. In other words, and given that we recognize thart we need to be somebody in order to become somebody else - as we have celebrated in the first chapter - let us start by celebrating the spealized movement that set us into tracks - Can I play? I shall play. Can I run? I shall run. Can I learn? I shall learn. And, as move on, reflect in alignment with the concerns from Reid which celebrates that what brought you here is not what take you there.
