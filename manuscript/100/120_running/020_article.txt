# Running 


A point cannot be missed that the one who lives up the startup challenges first-hand is in fact challenged to evolve his views from execution. We have celebrated that in the beginning of this book, but another profound truth carried by this idea suggests that all that happens, happens from the execution in the first place. We also have covered in our first chapter, *Accounting*, when we considered the importance of being somebody, respecting the self and our time, before becoming. In other words, like it or not, our new somebody required to the face the growth challenges only happens from the being, from the movement.

This is not only the starting point of this chapter, but also the starting point of the various chapters referred by the Blitzscaling, and chapters of our lives and our companies. Let us move on, and to certain extent embrace what appears to be a a paradox, following along with the concerns from Reid Hoffman who celebrates that, in essence, what brought us here is not what takes you there.

To run, they certainly from state of maturity sensed by them, a readiness level. That readiness level also explains when one declares to be founder and takes the steering wheel of a startup. Even when they know that their ship is sinking, as captains, they know how to run, the operationalization of a certain stability, of an execution. We know what it is to run and we know what it is to be driven by the duties we know we can commit to. In other words, all movements are done from the state that we are somebody in the first place. This idea, to be somebody, connect us back to that thought from Peter Drucker from the first chapter, it is a primal, or prime, necessity for getting things done.
