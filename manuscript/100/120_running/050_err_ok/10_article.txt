### From being right and fearful, to honesty

The subject in this chapter is how entrepreneurs can be pressured that takes them into bring blocked, as they feel they need to do it right, or doing it right which can be mediocre, or launch thinking they did right, and get frustrated. At the core, this has to do with integration, to be integer if I were to use Julia Cameron's words. 

#### Being right and stuck 



No one doing entrepreneurship expects a bad outcome, as in a product that fails, a service that is not welcomed, a solution that is poor. We all expect the best, noone doubts that - it's inescapable. And it also makes a lot of sense to not be arbitrary, although we understand the importance of zooming out to access a wider view before converging, polishing, concretizing.

A challenge, though, comes our way which comes from something great we learned as humans, something that we discussed too in the prior section; that as we do, as we run, as we follow duty of the calling, we do in a way by playing nice with our audiences. In other words, we might be operating with our specialist first, being safe, pleasing as well, expecting the best of course. Thus, we want to advance, we have aspiring goals, and we know too that the path is uncertain, that path of growth for the startup and for ourselves. But we want to do it with a degree of caution, by moving with an approval system, in a way going back to the leg of our mother, the entrepreneurial mother. We constantly may be asking her permission. By trying to do it right, we may get into places that we may not even desire too, such as to places we don't want to be, places we find ourselves lacking movement, lacking creativity, lacking energy, to be bored, to not find value or meaning for ourselves or with our audiences. 



> *"They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities."* Sir Ken Robinson (TED Conferences, 2006)

To not be meaningful which is not different from a writer trying to reach a good writer by first trying to write in the right ways. Point from Julia Cameron that what "we learn in school" has to do with a prose "that actually bores a lot of us out of writing". The thinking pushes us, according to her, "If you can't say anything nice - or nicely - don't say anything at all". That, according to Julia, is what we were taught. Yes, it damages us. For writing, she urges us to move out of that thinking, and mindset, or frameset. She suggests, towars what she believes is the enligthening way of supporting oneself towards *The Right to Write*,  to engage in a new way of doing it, "if only we could give ourselves permission to write 'badly,' so many of us would write very well indeed. "

Let us deepen this discussion, first by relating the entrepreneurial journey to writing, where the focus on being 'right' can lead to outcomes that are technically correct but lack soul or engagement. Next we will reflect that the key is to open up a conscious and creative pace of running; and we shall conclude reflecting that the critic will always come anyway, but that it can be a friendly one, not an enemy. 

#### Startup can played, like a game 

Here is where Julia Cameron comes to us again, her contribution set us into the enlighted ways and one that starts with permission. Permission to step into the opportunity path, permission to seek for engagement, for meaning, which may also mean that the path may appear to be wrong. By the way this opportunity path is about stepping into what would be the "bad writing that leads to good writing" or the "bad entrepreneurship of good entrepreneurshp". First, managing the possibility part, is pilar 1, supporting pilar. It's okay and real stories are not made of following the right stones and the "side B" of what it takes to do things matters. We need to grasp that first. That is that. 

Complex because being right, for the startup, may not look different from trying to be right for writing, as in good grammar or trying to write what others want to listen. In the startup situation the being right can be come out differently although the essence connects with being right in the eyes of another audience. And which is one of the criteria for the "right paths"? Following the stones such as the milestones that other successful stories, such as the milestones of success, seeking approaval from customers, from investors, from a process system that is seen as a validating process, sounding right to an advisor, and more. 

It is complex because in the startup situation it may be, for example, that quite exciting things are the actual things that are expected by this external system, an audience which we may want to please. The point is that colorful pathways can be these right pathways, and can be given by frameworks which can be seen as the right way of doing as told by their environment. It may be that the team sets a mat in front of them which in a way tells them where to jump - like a jump to conclusions mat [^footnote_jump_conclusions_mat], one which they can jump to, step into the right spots. 

[^footnote_jump_conclusions_mat]: The "Jump to Conclusions Mat" isn't really a game but a fictional product referred in the movie *Office Space*, to symbolize that humans may come up with systems that are meant to help them; but too that their own systems can also be means for executing and deciding in ways they want, as in to exercise control and not for being used as systems for comprehension. In the game, the player can "jump" to, literally by jumping on different labeled conclusions. The humor and satire of the game serve as a metaphor for the human tendency to jump to conclusions without sufficient evidence or reasoning. This product humorously critiques our often premature or simplistic decision-making processes, reflecting the broader comedic tone of the movie in which it appears.







The author Dov Seidman, in "How" (check page), introduces the concept of the Valley of Difficulty (check the name of the Valley) which describes the "paths" people go through when they face challenges; and he compares people who get a "B" grade with those who get an "A" and those who get a "C". The curve goes from "B" to "A", passing through "C". He points out, citing research (check), that between the "B" grade and the "A" grade there is a valley, a confusing and arduous place where many people get lost and end up stuck in the valley, receiving the "C" grade.

This space in the middle is a confusing zone that indeed demotivates many people, a valley that can be gloomy, in the sense that many get bogged down there. But those who pass through it manage to succumb (rise) and reach a clearer space, the "A" grade.

We all recognize that many things are difficult, because there is this pressure to do better - we are always comparing our work to the external world. So often the "task" to be done, the challenge, becomes nebulous precisely because our reference is the external world - for example, many of the challenges faced by entrepreneurs are guided by metrics, like the idea of being better, faster, cheaper. Often, the pilgrimage in this valley becomes indeed frustrating because it starts with parameters, becomes mediocre, when it is limited to having to differentiate from something that others do, such as competition.













#### Controlling and creativity 

Maslow See the point? The real point is about trying to control success, which is not the creative mindset. The colorful and likely bad writing of a writer's path is the bad of unknown which, for one that expects to be a writing, the not allowed path. Why? Because it would be boring, too painful, not possible to grab success with that uncertainty.  

It's not about doing the bad and arbitrary and even colorful which is meant for the sake of executing chaos as if chaos means creativity. Or, on the other hand, the right outcome that has not color, the extremmes. These are two faces of operating as in trying to control, a movement that is forced. In this regard, I would like to bring a concrete contribution from Maslow from *Maslow on Management*. When he refers to the creative being, the being that does not control the outcome. But see, the creative is not random too. He or she is just outside the pressure system of trying to control: 

> *"Need to pick the Reference of quotation and page for this Maslow of Management article about the creative person."*

This allowing may set the team into joyful findings, if we put ourselves into the possibility. Thus, this is about having fun too, as a path. A gentlemen which I met in the bus one day asked me to organize the company, the room, without worrying about the outcome, that things would work in the end. I felt something big there as in "do not control". In the releasing control, as an exercise of process, we can find joy too, a calmness. What if we can do that "in the day" as opposed to "in the year" or "in the week" in opposed to "in the month". See, going back to recognizing the axis of the free and creative (not right) versus the controled and right way, we can unleash us into the "moments of relaxation" which may in fact set us into having clear views about the whole thing.  





Investor Paul Graham created another illustration for a different type of valley that also affects entrepreneurs, called the "Valley of Sorrow," shown below.

[Figure of Paul Graham's Valley of Sorrow]

In Paul Graham's version, entrepreneurs launch their products and initially gain some traction—they get media coverage and experience a sort of pre-carnival; but soon they find themselves alone, without users or customers, and no longer appear in the media. They have passed through. In this zone, many give up. Still, in the optimistic narrative, the survivors find themselves on a slow growth curve; and this is Paul Graham's advice for entrepreneurs to focus on learning and gaining real traction with their customers—the trend of "doing things that don't scale," a topic for the next section. [Check which section].

[Check if this article is redundant due to another article somewhere that also talked about Paul Graham's Valley of Sorrow]

But Paul made this forecast, based on experience, observation. Perhaps this version of the valley of sorrow came out with this drawing, this initial curve followed by a valley, a slow and arduous pilgrimage, precisely because at some point the world, the entrepreneurs, began to operate "on the wave" of previous successful models, from others. Paul Graham's valley is very clear on the first mountain.

[Figure of an ascending curve, without the valley; versus the curve with the valley. Showing the initial problem]

It can then be articulated that the problem of the valley, or relevant issue, stems from the initial urgency, in the first place - the intention to launch into the world, perhaps artificially.











#### The friendly critic

For writing, according to our Julia Cameron, it works and works and it is the only way, for real, to get there. Yes, fixing the grammar and a conscious path is a must. The same for entrepreneneuship, the release of control also involves allowence go the joy of the day and the release of stress of trying to control - being romantic control or systematic control. See, for founders, controlling sales, or success can also be romantic control. What matters is coordination, with time and opportunity, moving, and of course, managing goals from time to time.  







If we subtract the normal growth curve from Paul Graham's curve, we have the hill of promise:

[Figure of the hill of promise]

Then we can formalize that entrepreneurs must be aware of their urgent steps when they enter the launch field. Because launches promise. The most important point, number one, is awareness and managing expectations - we must thank Paul Graham for reminding us that if things calm down, if they get boring, if the customer doesn't show up, etc., etc.; you weren't the first to go through this and you won't be the last. This path demands you to continue, and use the calm to learn and improve your solution, business, product, relationship, etc.

Point number two, that the initial promise, the launch - call it what you will - should be seen more coldly, as an experiment. This is a mindset and doing so not only creates less frustration but also helps in structuring the episode with more rigor and less bet, like thinking it will work out. This model of strategizing says that there is an overarching meta control - as if it were a premeditated battle where the outcome, positive or negative, is always positive, an experiment.

Now, looking at a more generalized issue regarding these two valleys - all of them and those who created them are warning us so that we can proceed, to be resilient. That is the main message allied to the message that says we were not the first and we will not be the last who will face these valleys.

But connected to this idea is an optimistic view, if we assume that the investment is precisely in the field of the valley, if we think it is worth it. The valley, in the optimistic view, of that entrepreneur or group that sees it as a challenge - and that allows time and invests in the situation - is the great opportunity. The valley is the real work that must be done, and the process of walking through it needs to be nurtured. It all starts with permission and time allocated. It's not to say that time pressure should be eliminated, that no schedule is needed. But it is to say that the solution should not be dominated by a time schedule only and that sometimes the group needs to launch into the valley with positive energy, with an attitude of understanding the problem and with curiosity as its guide.

The valley is the opportunity, not the death.
