## The specialist and the generalist 






We may call that "to run," or to harvest. We seem to know what that is about. As in, that some knowledge of that is intrinsic, that it lives within ourselves, something that we recognized when we are ready to step up to a certain challenge. It may be driving the colorful movement of a child that paints the blanks of a drawing. Or maybe the movement further she that is a star in a field, or he is skilled, or talended, as seen by the eyes of an audience. To run, they certainly feel some maturity, or an awareness of their readiness level, such as the readiness sensed by the one is turned into a founder and takes the steering wheel of a startup. In other words, it is necessary to feel as someone in a now-movement, in alignment with what we considered from Peter Drucker's thought in the first chapter, so that we move forward for getting things done only happens after. 

AS as they run, and execute, such as to do it in ways "no matter what," they too face another inescapable challenge, especially if they are serious and if they care for a culture to enable scale and grow, which is the need to becoming generalists. According to Reid Hoffman, in *How to Build a Strong, Scalable Culture for Blitzscaling* (2019), generalists are "people who can change directions, refactor priorities, learn something new, and adapt quickly to whatever curveballs the universe throws at them." We should note that Reid is not asking us us to be or to bring people such as the ones which are specialists in changing directions, or obsessed with refactoring priorities, or drifters in the learning world. Reid's call, actually in fact, calls for something that requires a "specialist AND generalist" mentality, which accepts and welcomes the roles of "contributors who are great at what they do," even to be okay to get involved with people who "aren’t going to scale into senior roles when the company grows."

Now a major problem naturally rises, which not only due to the need of balancing the roles of the specialist and the generalist, specially for the founder team, which deserves a calmer reflection, exactly because it may be so that, again, it may be well the case that we get into the possibility of becoming a generalist only after being, in the first place, being somebody that does something already, perhaps more that runs more like a specialist first, in a way or another. And where we are going next, which I shall frame part of my story of starting as a specialist, is to exactly debug the being, the specialist, to set us to rest assured that all beings formed are formed first because the enter the becoming in the first place; although in many situations we miss the means of becoming, we generally take for granted, the movement, see fail to see the dots connecting (in alighment with Stebe Jobs point.) This is a general flaw perhaps in our educational system, in many cultures, perhaps linked to the fact that we are educated, as adults, in ways to miss the value of becoming.

As you recall I brought a bit from the history of Netscape when exploring the theme of bundle and unbundle. You may remember too that the idea of bundle was given to me from the action, from the field, from the job, that fast-paced place where words and terms and expressions, and ways to do things, are thrown at us, logically to somebody that is wanted, faster hands. Speaking of fast hands of the west and remembering these days in Silicon Valley, I won't ever forget the day when our team was about to change because our manager were leaving the spot. He called us to the meeting room and had technical keywords to be given to most of us. We are changing, so let us find who will do what, okay? Who knows JavaScript? The JavaScript expert was known so we all pointed to Bob, actually to the Polycom conference phone at the center of the table since Bob was in the east coast. Who knows DOM? I raised my hands fast, I loved DOM. But then all the five keywords were fired, and picked by our fast hands, except that we were six. Marie, you will be their manager. The meeting was over. We were back to our cubicles, my hands were back to the keyboard, the fastest typer in the west. 

The prose which I am pushing here, with the story my own job at Netsscape, carries a tone of suspiction, setting the stage for the reflections that must be in order so that we can access the generalist or to unbundle our fast-paced work situation. But I am exactly bringing the story in this order, specialist first and generalist later, because this is the order of life as we know it, that we can only become after being first. In other words, we should first celebrate the opportunity where the next rises from the now. With that, an intern can be working alongside a skilled doctor and can pass a complex tool that is critically necessary for the next job step of a heart surgery. Thus, even if our spinning globe seems somewhat arbitrary, it seems plausible to celebrate the goods of life when we have the chance to be the young pieces thrown into something that is pre-bundled, running. Of course, then we will follow up soon with reflections about escaping from these nets.  







When I was thrown at Netscape I was excited. But moments before, while in the university, I knew that I was a sort of not so normal student. Seeing by collegues as creative being, was an optimistic viewpoint. Wearing an unusual outfit and generally in the lab, was something else. I got in in 1993, when the movie Jurrassic Park was out and the Internet was exciting plus the browser was new as we have discussed. I had reasons to be in the lab and not to pay attention to the classes. It was a Computer Science course by the way. Approaching eight years, by 2000, after having accumulated more university friends than usual, and likely a life debt to the Brazilian government for paying the bill, I was finally invited to an internship at Netscape, that browser making company helping the world to navigate the Web. After joining Netscape, I might have normalized myself, in a way. I felt as a being, as somebody. There were too many new things, and excitement, and new systems in place keeping me in the line, in a way. I didn't want to make the same "mistake" which I did in the University, in the sense of "taking eight years" to complete the course. That was a sort of tought, so I wanted to be professional in a way. I knew my best and my beast but I was fine to be educated. I were in a new country too, right? I was okay to become a listener in a way since I respected them too much, that place which I had an opinion, a place which I trusted, since somehow Silicon Valley was like a home I knew. And it makes sense, doesn't? And it isn't bad, isn't it? 

With the good things in place, and being somebody, I may have in a way entered into a path which many enter when they face the reality of jobs, when we embrace certain ways of operation tied to a culture. We sort of embrace the mechanics of it to a point of integrating us into what they do and how they do, which will certainly take us in new directions and to life the struggles, to be affected in many ways, to gain experience, maturity. It's chaos to a certain extent when the prior ourselves are into the being someone. That is nothing much wrong about that, perhaps, except that we seem to be captivated by the operational model which eventually seems to prevent us to do come out with new ideas when it is needed. 

Looking from this perspective of us being normalized to some extent, through the normal course of jobs as given, many outcomes may happen from the experience of running. One is that we will become good, from the effort, to operate the pen - if the environment of our working were a pen and outcomes expected to a blank sheet of paper - in certain ways. What comes may not be far from what screenwriting professor Robert McKee said, in an interview to *Indie Film Hustle*, about how new screenwriters grow their reliance on clichés: On one hand, they aim to create original art. On the other they value and understand that they cannot entirely reinvent the wheel. Thus, their reliance on clichés grows. And it may grow to the point that "once they sell their soul, it's hard to get it back" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 10:36).

McKee also points a related concern where the writer fails the writer's duty of expressing the truth of the human condition. Or, as he puts it, "they think that because it is fiction, they have a license to lie" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 12:02). He warns of the perils of resorting to clichés and of losing one's authentic voice in an attempt to please the audience. As McKee puts it, "Of all those things, cliches and [lack of] truthfulness, are all the byproduct of the young writer's desire to please" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 13:08).

That wasn't different for me althought the paper were other forms of output - mostly written things anyways since I were a technical communicator. Within a world that seemed to have new rules, tools and culture or culture as a tool, I found a place where some clichés were projecting the operational models. Things like "keep cranking," and rooms that were labelled as "war rooms" and to a great extent the expectations that didn't really asked us much about how we wanted to be, our future and the future of our company. 

We were essentially executing, in the first place. The reflections, from above if any, had to come from us. I felt every day consuming a sort of energy but it wasn't possible to say that outloud to me because it wasn't clear. It is not visible, especially when you are in a nice place, like within the walls of that building, building 21. I sort tried to figure the general function of climbing and somehow for us that may also conflict with some internal inner function for growing. Again, not clear that dichotomy or dissonance or two worlds separated in a way. Actually, as for trying to fit, I didn't try to do that on my own, as in counsiously as in trying to hack the system or to play the game. 

The system in itself tells you that, some ways to operate, in a way, with things such as performance reviews and the nuances from the hallways and conversations of the day, that seem to be telling us the pace, the rithmn, the what to do and how to do. 

But I should recount too that, in fact, the system weren't telling me explicitelly all of that. In other words, I were behaving in some new ways from how I saw things, from a perspective which I likely nurtured, from likely not reflecting properly, or not having a sort of therapeuthic moment like the kind of experience that a reflecting writing moment or coach session could do. 

It was very difficult to see that inside a being was being missed. 

Now looking back it is easier to see the dots. One of them were a "side startup" which I had assembled to make something new, something different. The operationalization of that consisted of weekly meetings with my friend Roger and his ocassional visits to the Bay Area. He came many times, we had design and ideas, we had consistent development happening, we had our weekend meetings, and we even did presentations of what we did, even inside of Netscape or to Netscape partners. Some of our "products" were used by the company too. We know we were really close to make a serious startup on the side. That would be an example of an activity that seemed to be balancing something I needed. But, as we know and due to the fast-paced nature, a major problem is that we will not know the thing we want to what is next, to what we want to become.

-->



And too, conversely, it would too be difficult to see what were the actual prior movements that brought me in, to be seen as a specialist. It wasn't difficult to see talents, or skills, some of the things which I brought as I were hired, things recognized by the eyes of an audience which sometimes give to us a few claps. To think of the traits and characteristics we bring, and how far (or superficial) the work places deals with these, set us at the footsteps to reflect about the paradox of one that is locked in the specialist room and struggles to escape to the generalist room. For me, that half-key which was in my mind and stuck for years, was given by a cumpliment from an employee that once said: Marcio, whatever you are smoking, please keep doing that. 

If I were smoking I would know. But I wasn't. While I sensed a hint I was too focused in looking at things "through the eyes of man", generally executing life too fast, too fast to know anyway, being one in the first place, fine, but anyway not able to see through. In other words, it was difficult to see in the carpet which I was were using to fly how all had links to threads I once had in my hands. What I felt fits well the complexity of figuring our lives as given by Steve Jobs's speech which I brought before, when we can't see the dots while doing, while being. It was, for me, through the reflective moments which I found later, and likely the celebration that magic and flying carpets comes from prior threads, that spoke just like the saying of Stephen Schwartz speaks to us, *Through Heaven's Eyes* from The Prince of Egypt, whispers a truth that shall take us to escape from that specialist room: 

> *"A single thread in a tapestry - Though its color brightly shine - Can never see its purpose - In the pattern of the grand design. And the stone that sits on the very top - Of the mountain's mighty face - Does it think it's more important - Than the stones that form the base? So how can you see what your life is worth? Or where your value lies? You can never see through the eyes of man. You must look at your life. Look at your life through heaven's eyes."* (Schwartz, n.d.)

### Back to the well 



The fact that heaven, or other symbols of a space beyond, generally appears through communciations of a transcending order in our lives, carries a key to solve the problem from the situation of working, and in general of living, the complexity to see the dots from the on-the-go, the challenge to see that from the threads of the day there is likely a tapestry to be made. If we get distracted with the Gods or Heaven, or too impressed, we may miss. While the punch in the face, if we accept to take, is exactly the other component - that we wear the shoes of the man, the runner shows, the movement that in itself prevents growth. Using the eyes of man, as we know it, we may miss. In other words, I was too eager, surfing on skills or talents priourly acquired, too eager, just working, just running, just looking at all the work environment using the eyes of man. Just trying to climb with priour skills. And if our companies keep telling us to "keep doing that, whatever you are smoking," we are giving them more reasons to keep looking through the eyes of man and keep ignoring the calm reflection that is needed. What we run, indeed, with that fast-paced life, is running the risk of missing the existance of a well.  

The well is the thing that makes us to become. The well is a symbol of the acquired experience given by the threads we mess up with, even in arbitrary ways. My eight years in the university I likely were pouring things into that well. The rise of the browser, the movie Jurrassic Park, the prior movements and movies, the prior experiences, the personal computer rising as I were growing, the struggles, the challenges, the friends, the loves, the losses, the struggles, all. It is, to a great extent, quite sad that all that happens happens slow, but then and out of the sudden, we engage into wrapping ourselves, like taking that carpet which we refuse to see the time it took to make, which certainly shows a pattern through tiles of talents and skills, wrapping it, reducing ourselves to something too little and too powerful, like a résumé that is sent to somebody that can be impressed, that can be in a hurry, and may hire you. At that moment, we aren't only wrapping ourselves and missing the points, the threads, the dots, we are also setting ourselves to do the same, to see people as products, or pieces that fits, to ignore that all things that are, that they Become, came from a being, an experience, a life, a slow cooking if you will. For us founders, especially, is key, since to miss accounting that Becoming comes from the Being, would lead us to not be nurturing the well, would lead us to not respect that all beings need to keep nurturing that well, or conscious of that well anyway. We aren't products, as in off-the-shelf products. We are beings. And we need to preserve that so that we can pay attention to the movement that set us into the becoming from the being. In other words, we need to not miss being aware of the dots, which involves appreciating the threads, the threads from the being from the living even when the living conditions are quite challenging. The thread is key to that tapestry, first, and to also keep noticing it, again and again.

The situation leads to a sort of fusion with the art being done, emptyness, which is not far from the situation known as the artist's block. In the search for maintaing, or recovering that self in the face of a challenging setting, in the face of challenging goals, we shall count with the wisdom of Julia Cameron, the author of *The Artist's Way* and *The Right to Write*. For Julia, the true writer, that is committed to being a writer, pulls things from a well (1998, p.66). But as a result of the process, and success, of pulling things from that well given by the job of writing, she finds that her well goes empty. It is certainly the case of a beginner founder, like a beginner writer or a beginner worker, especially the ones in a fast-paced movement of live, to not know of that well. They didn't see it when they were working out the threads. The prompt that Julia Cameron promotes, is a call for nurturing the maintenance of that well. If works for a writing life it may also mean as a reminder to the life of an entrepreneur, or anyone that wants to achieve success or impact. She called for, from Right to Write, a prior state of wellness, first: 

> *"If we are invested in a writing life - as opposed to a writing career - then we are in it for the process and not for the product. We are in it for the body of work and not for the quick hit of one well-realized piece. This means we must treat ourselves as valued athletes who must be kept in condition and not overraced or overtrained."*  (Julia Cameron, 1998, p.66)

Her provocation is a reminder that to focus on that "one well-realized piece," we are in the first place ignoring what brought us there, even the experiences that appeared as arbitrary, such as our struggling or chaotic movements. We should notice too, her differentiation from life and career. Is that far from the phenomenon of when one is somebody hired, that had a life before, and then develops a career and then is losing that some unknown thing every day? She is asking writers, the ones that want to become good writers anyway, to see the process beyond the present moment, to respect the process, to respect the dots. 

When founders decide to start and run their start-ups they run that risk, to ignore their past and what they should be doing to maintain their well. They generally were not even trained to see, to respect, to tell, which places they have visited that served to them as the energy, such as the energy to start, or the source of creative power, and which helps them to be able to work, to deliver. As they get busy with the new running experience, they are simply consuming the resources from that well. Sometimes we can sort of bring the bits and pieces of it, but it isn't enough. We need to pause and reflect on us beyond the eyes of the work, the job, the routine, the specialist tracks. And worse, when founders - such as the ones that achieved known success - are interviewed about some good job they did, they are unable to skim the subject and really tell what brought them there in the first place. When we enter entrepreneurship, and perhaps anything in general, we generally bring some arbitrary notions of what we did before. We look into that hat and pull some bits and pieces from it, thinking that our success has nothing to do with that well, with the creation of that well, with the steps towards that well. But worse, we miss the fact that maintaining that well is key to our state of well-being, the well-being state that is necessary for the growth and challenging stages ahead.

What founders can't see nevertheless brings them to a situation of felling stalled and having perceptions such as "we are not motivated anymore" or "things are not working" and the many variations of that which are essentially telling them that the current being can't do much and at the same time they reseting a new being is not possible, which prevents the becoming. Missing the nurturing of that well leads to missing the key into being the generalist. When Steve Jobs dropped from University and sought the caligraphy course, he was filling up his well. When Steve Jobs was fired from Apple, he likely went to a place to filled that well. Julia also brought a situation of a television executive that started as a producer with a goal of doing good to the world but caught himself in a kind of existential crisis as his "inner reality and his outer world no longer mesh" (1998, p.108). He was lucky that he, as she wrote, had engaged in a mechanism of crisis management consisting of a daily writing exercise that takes in consideration his value system, where he is okay with discomfort, where he states his dreams, where he brings the reality he faces, where he can be conscious about himself. The reflective writing exercise of the executive celebrates how one checks on his integrity.

--> 

The success we seek, ultimately, is not arrive at a scene as beings that somehow had stumbled in a state of well being; so that we brought ourselves in the readiness level where we can pull an idea of the hat and then success is measured from our ability to execute and deliver to the world, keep pulling from a hat. As the matter depends on embracing the creative state of well being - which is a requirement for entrepreneurship - we must seek to understand that success is success in the long run, that we need to nurture ourselves to be able to pull solutions from the well as much as keep experiencing and act to fill that well. And that such effort has to be done also at an individual level, for everyone involved. 

But even when we sense that we dismiss that thing as not a subject associated with our jobs. The thinking of going for it, having a date with your inner artist, starts as an absurd - it will be onerous. Alone? I can't have time for alone. It might start there or with other objections as it does not fit life as we know it. Not the working life.

@citation Maslow - Toward a Psychology of Being

* "The steps and the choices are taken out of pure spontaneity, from within outward. The healthy infant or child, just Being, as *part* of his Being, is randomly, and spontaneously curious, exploratory, wandering, interested. Even when he is non-purposeful, non-copying, expressively, spontaneous, not motivated by any deficiency of the ordinary sort, he tends to try out his powers, to reach out, to be absorbed, fascinated, interested, to play, to wander, to manipulate the world. *Exploring*, *manipulating*, *experiencing*, being interested, choosing, delighting, enjoying, can all be seen as attributes of pure Being, and yet lead to Becoming, though in a serendipitous way, fortuitously, unplanned, unanticipated. Spontaneous creative experience can and does happen without expectations, plans, foresight, purpose, or goal." (Maslow, 2011, p. 43).
