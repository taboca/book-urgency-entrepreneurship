## The specialist and the generalist 






We may call that "to run," or to harvest. We seem to know what that is about. As in, that some knowledge of that is intrinsic, that it lives within ourselves, something that we recognized when we are ready to step up to a certain challenge. It may be driving the colorful movement of a child that paints the blanks of a drawing. Or maybe the movement further she that is a star in a field, or he is skilled, or talended, as seen by the eyes of an audience. To run, they certainly feel some maturity, or an awareness of their readiness level, such as the readiness sensed by the one is turned into a founder and takes the steering wheel of a startup. In other words, it is necessary to feel as someone in a now-movement, in alignment with what we considered from Peter Drucker's thought in the first chapter, so that we move forward for getting things done only happens after. 

AS as they run, and execute, such as to do it in ways "no matter what," they too face another inescapable challenge, especially if they are serious and if they care for a culture to enable scale and grow, which is the need to becoming generalists. According to Reid Hoffman, in *How to Build a Strong, Scalable Culture for Blitzscaling* (2019), generalists are "people who can change directions, refactor priorities, learn something new, and adapt quickly to whatever curveballs the universe throws at them." We should note that Reid is not asking us us to be or to bring people such as the ones which are specialists in changing directions, or obsessed with refactoring priorities, or drifters in the learning world. Reid's call, actually in fact, calls for something that requires a "specialist AND generalist" mentality, which accepts and welcomes the roles of "contributors who are great at what they do," even to be okay to get involved with people who "aren’t going to scale into senior roles when the company grows."

Now a major problem naturally rises, which not only due to the need of balancing the roles of the specialist and the generalist, specially for the founder team, which deserves a calmer reflection, exactly because it may be so that, again, it may be well the case that we get into the possibility of becoming a generalist only after being, in the first place, being somebody that does something already, perhaps more that runs more like a specialist first, in a way or another. And where we are going next, which I shall frame part of my story of starting as a specialist, is to exactly debug the being, the specialist, to set us to rest assured that all beings formed are formed first because the enter the becoming in the first place; although in many situations we miss the means of becoming, we generally take for granted, the movement, see fail to see the dots connecting (in alighment with Stebe Jobs point.) This is a general flaw perhaps in our educational system, in many cultures, perhaps linked to the fact that we are educated, as adults, in ways to miss the value of becoming.

As you recall I brought a bit from the history of Netscape when exploring the theme of bundle and unbundle. You may remember too that the idea of bundle was given to me from the action, from the field, from the job, that fast-paced place where words and terms and expressions, and ways to do things, are thrown at us, logically to somebody that is wanted, faster hands. Speaking of fast hands of the west and remembering these days in Silicon Valley, I won't ever forget the day when our team was about to change because our manager were leaving the spot. He called us to the meeting room and had technical keywords to be given to most of us. We are changing, so let us find who will do what, okay? Who knows JavaScript? The JavaScript expert was known so we all pointed to Bob, actually to the Polycom conference phone at the center of the table since Bob was in the east coast. Who knows DOM? I raised my hands fast, I loved DOM. But then all the five keywords were fired, and picked by our fast hands, except that we were six. Marie, you will be their manager. The meeting was over. We were back to our cubicles, my hands were back to the keyboard, the fastest typer in the west. 

The prose which I am pushing here, with the story my own job at Netsscape, carries a tone of suspiction, setting the stage for the reflections that must be in order so that we can access the generalist or to unbundle our fast-paced work situation. But I am exactly bringing the story in this order, specialist first and generalist later, because this is the order of life as we know it, that we can only become after being first. In other words, we should first celebrate the opportunity where the next rises from the now. With that, an intern can be working alongside a skilled doctor and can pass a complex tool that is critically necessary for the next job step of a heart surgery. Thus, even if our spinning globe seems somewhat arbitrary, it seems plausible to celebrate the goods of life when we have the chance to be the young pieces thrown into something that is pre-bundled, running. Of course, then we will follow up soon with reflections about escaping from these nets.  





When I was thrown at Netscape I was excited. But moments before, while in the university, I knew that I was a sort of not so normal student. Seeing by collegues as creative being, was an optimistic viewpoint. Wearing an unusual outfit and generally in the lab, was something else. I got in in 1993, when the movie Jurrassic Park was out and the Internet was exciting plus the browser was new as we have discussed. I had reasons to be in the lab and not to pay attention to the classes. It was a Computer Science course by the way. Approaching eight years, by 2000, after having accumulated more university friends than usual, and likely a life debt to the Brazilian government for paying the bill, I was finally invited to an internship at Netscape, that browser making company helping the world to navigate the Web. After joining Netscape, I might have normalized myself, in a way. I felt as a being, as somebody. There were too many new things, and excitement, and new systems in place keeping me in the line, in a way. I didn't want to make the same "mistake" which I did in the University, in the sense of "taking eight years" to complete the course. That was a sort of tought, so I wanted to be professional in a way. I knew my best and my beast but I was fine to be educated. I were in a new country too, right? I was okay to become a listener in a way since I respected them too much, that place which I had an opinion, a place which I trusted, since somehow Silicon Valley was like a home I knew. And it makes sense, doesn't? And it isn't bad, isn't it? 

With the good things in place, and being somebody, I may have in a way entered into a path which many enter when they face the reality of jobs, when we embrace certain ways of operation tied to a culture. We sort of embrace the mechanics of it to a point that what they do, and how they do, is affected by that. That is nothing much wrong about that, perhaps, except that we seem to be captivated by the operational model which eventually seems to prevent us to do come out with new ideas when it is needed. The thing with the normal course of jobs is perhaps not much different of what the screenwriting professor Robert McKee said about the situation that young screenwriters face, after they learn how to use clichés. In an interview given to Indie Film Hustle, McKee pinpoints a critical trap that new screenwriters often fall as they craft their narratives - their reliance on clichés: While they aim to create original art they also understand that they cannot entirely reinvent the wheel. The reliance on clichés, however, leads to a phenomenon where "once they sell their soul, it's hard to get it back" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 10:36).

@note 
McKee also points a related concern where the writer fails the writer's duty of expressing the truth of the human condition. Or, as he puts it, "they think that because it is fiction, they have a license to lie" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 12:02). He warns of the perils of resorting to clichés and of losing one's authentic voice in an attempt to please the audience. As McKee puts it, "Of all those things, cliches and [lack of] truthfulness, are all the byproduct of the young writer's desire to please" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 13:08).

That wasn't different for me. I found a place where people seem to climb using certain skills, or clichés, or ways or operational models. I sort tried to figure the general function of climbing. Actually, I didn't try to do that on my own, as in counsiously as in trying to hack the system or trying to find a legit way to play the game. The system in itself were telling me to operate, in a way, with things such as performance reviews and the nuances from the hallways that seem to be telling me what to do and how to do. But it should be noted that the system wasn't really telling me explicitelly all of that; that I was behaving in some new ways from how I saw things, from a perspective which I likely nurtured from likely not reflecting properly. To some extent, I felt I was distancing from a being, from a being of before. A major problem was that I didn't know what was that thing I had before which I needed to keep alive. It wasn't difficult to see talents, or skills, some of the things which I brought as I were hired, things recognized by the eyes of an audience which sometimes give to us a few claps. To think of the traits and characteristics we bring, and how far (or superficial) the work places deals with these, set us at the footsteps to reflect about the paradox of one that is locked in the specialist room and struggles to escape to the generalist room. For me, that half-key which was in my mind and stuck for years, was given by a cumpliment from an employee that once said: Marcio, whatever you are smoking, please keep doing that. 

If I were smoking I would know. But I wasn't. While I sensed a hint I was too focused in looking at things "through the eyes of man", generally executing life too fast, too fast to know anyway, being one in the first place, fine, but anyway not able to see through. In other words, it was difficult to see in the carpet which I was were using to fly how all had links to threads I once had in my hands. What I felt fits well the complexity of figuring our lives as given by Steve Jobs's speech which I brought before, when we can't see the dots while doing, while being. It was, for me, through the reflective moments which I found later, and likely the celebration that magic and flying carpets comes from prior threads, that spoke just like the saying of Stephen Schwartz speaks to us, *Through Heaven's Eyes* from The Prince of Egypt, whispers a truth that shall take us to escape from that specialist room: 

> *"A single thread in a tapestry - Though its color brightly shine - Can never see its purpose - In the pattern of the grand design. And the stone that sits on the very top - Of the mountain's mighty face - Does it think it's more important - Than the stones that form the base? So how can you see what your life is worth? Or where your value lies? You can never see through the eyes of man. You must look at your life. Look at your life through heaven's eyes."* (Schwartz, n.d.)

The fact that heaven generally comes handy to tip some of us about the threads we can't see that leads to a tapestry, holds a lot more to the solution that may have less to do with our quick perceptions of us being distracted with symbols of Gods or heaven. What it holds, a punch in the face if we accept to take, is exactly that we look at things with the "eyes of man," or the reality of now. It is impressive how we miss the point given by all ideas which ask us to transcend: That we miss being suspicious of the realities of now. I was too eager, surfing on skills, to know and to celebrate the many single threads that brought me make a carpet. When our companies tell us to "keep doing that, whatever you are smoking," we are looking through the eyes of man. What we run, indeed, with that fast-paced life, is running the risk of missing the existance of a well.  

The well is the thing that makes you unique, the experience given by the threads we mess up with, even in arbitrary ways. My eight years in the university I likely were pouring things into that well. The rise of the browser, the movie Jurrassic Park, the prior movements and movies, the prior experiences, the personal computer rising as I were growing, the struggles, the challenges. It is, to a great extent, sad that talent and skills, the prior experience is projected and fits into little things like a résumé. When we sort of make us like a product, to fit, we set ourselves to do it, we do it then, we run, and we can indeed commit and indeed vomit, to some extent, to great extent, indeed. It may work, for a while. But the more do not recognize the need to look at our lives not from the eyes of man - as we made it - the more we miss accounting that becoming of the new being demands a nurturing a well. We aren't products, as in off-the-shelf products. We are beings. And we need to preserve that so that we can pay attention to the movement that set us into the becoming from the being. In other words, we need to not miss being aware of the dots, which involves appreciating the threads, the threads from the being from the living even when the living conditions are quite challenging. The thread is key to that tapestry, first, and to also keep noticing it, again and again.

The situation leads to a sort of fusion with the art being done, empty, which is not far from the situation known as the artist's block. In the search for maintaing the that maintenance of a self across the challenging setting, we shall count with the wisdom of Julia Cameron, the author of *The Artist's Way* and *The Right to Write*. For Julia, the true writer, that is committed to being a writer, pulls things from a well (1998, p.66). But as a result of the process, and success, of pulling things from that well given by the job of writing, she finds that her well goes empty. It is certainly the case of a beginner founder, like a beginner writer or a beginner worker, especially the ones in a fast-paced movement, to not know of that well. They didn't see the threads. The prompt that Julia Cameron promotes, which will lead to the need to nurture that well, works for a writing life and is also a well-advice to the life of an entrepreneur or anyone that wants to achieve success, or impact. She wrote, from Right to Write: 

> *"If we are invested in a writing life - as opposed to a writing career - then we are in it for the process and not for the product. We are in it for the body of work and not for the quick hit of one well-realized piece. This means we must treat ourselves as valued athletes who must be kept in condition and not overraced or overtrained."*  (Julia Cameron, 1998, p.66)

The provocation of Julia lifts us towards the reality that we can be fixed, or obsessed, with that "one well-realized piece," ignoring what brought us there, the place and experiences we we certainly miss as likely a lot had appeared as arbitrary, as struggling moments, as chaotic too. Notice her differentiating life from career - Is that far from the phenomenon of when one is somebody hired, that had a life before, and then develops a career and then is losing it every day? She is asking writers, the ones that want to become good writers, do see the process beyond the present moment. When founders run their start-ups like careers, even when they join after coming from a great experience that brought them to start the project, they can't tell which places they have visited that served to them as the energy, or the source of creative power, and which helps them to be able to work, to deliver. 

Sometimes we can sort of bring the bits and pieces of it, but it isn't enough. We need to pause and reflect on us beyond the eyes of the work, the job, the routine, the specialist tracks. And worse, when founders - such as the ones that achieved known success - are interviewed about some good job they did, they are unable to skim the subject and really tell what brought them there in the first place. When we enter entrepreneurship, and perhaps anything in general, we generally bring some arbitrary notions of what we did before. We look into that hat and pull some bits and pieces from it, thinking that our success has nothing to do with that well, with the creation of that well, with the steps towards that well. But worse, we miss the fact that maintaining that well is key to our state of well-being, the well-being state that is necessary for the growth and challenging stages ahead.

What founders can't see, that brings them to the resulting phenomenon - or felling stalled and having perceptions such as "we are not motivated as we were" or "things are not working" or "the market is not accepting" and the many variations of that - is that we might have another underlying reason to be there, to being somebody, in that process. Missing that leads to missing the key into being the generalist. 

Julia pointed a situation of a television executive that started as a producer with a goal of doing good to the world but caught himself in a kind of existential crisis as his "inner reality and his outer world no longer mesh" (1998, p.108). She elaborated about his mechanism of crisis management consisting of a daily writing exercise that takes in consideration his value system, where he is okay with discomfort, where he states his dreams, where he brings the reality he faces, where he can be conscious about himself. The reflective writing exercise of the executive celebrates how one checks on his integrity.

The success we seek, ultimately, is not arrive at a scene as beings that somehow had stumbled in a state of well being; so that we brought ourselves in the readiness level where we can pull an idea of the hat and then success is measured from our ability to execute and deliver to the world, keep pulling from a hat. As the matter depends on embracing the creative state of well being - which is a requirement for entrepreneurship - we must seek to understand that success is success in the long run, that we need to nurture ourselves to be able to pull solutions from the well as much as keep experiencing and act to fill that well. And that such effort has to be done also at an individual level, for everyone involved. 

But even when we sense that we dismiss that thing as not a subject associated with our jobs. The thinking of going for it, having a date with your inner artist, starts as an absurd - it will be onerous. Alone? I can't have time for alone. It might start there or with other objections as it does not fit life as we know it. Not the working life.
