## The specialist and the generalist 






We may call that "to run," or to harvest. We seem to know what that is about. As in, that some knowledge of that is intrinsic, that it lives within ourselves, something that we recognized when we are ready to step up to a certain challenge. It may be driving the colorful movement of a child that paints the blanks of a drawing. Or maybe the movement further she that is a star in a field, or he is skilled, or talended, as seen by the eyes of an audience. To run, they certainly feel some maturity, or an awareness of their readiness level, such as the readiness sensed by the one is turned into a founder and takes the steering wheel of a startup. In other words, it is necessary to feel as someone in a now-movement, in alignment with what we considered from Peter Drucker's thought in the first chapter, so that we move forward for getting things done only happens after. 

AS as they run, and execute, such as to do it in ways "no matter what," they too face another inescapable challenge, especially if they are serious and if they care for a culture to enable scale and grow, which is the need to becoming generalists. According to Reid Hoffman, in *How to Build a Strong, Scalable Culture for Blitzscaling* (2019), generalists are "people who can change directions, refactor priorities, learn something new, and adapt quickly to whatever curveballs the universe throws at them." We should note that Reid is not asking us us to be or to bring people such as the ones which are specialists in changing directions, or obsessed with refactoring priorities, or drifters in the learning world. Reid's call, actually in fact, calls for something that requires a "specialist AND generalist" mentality, which accepts and welcomes the roles of "contributors who are great at what they do," even to be okay to get involved with people who "aren’t going to scale into senior roles when the company grows."

Now a major problem naturally rises, which not only due to the need of balancing the roles of the specialist and the generalist, specially for the founder team, which deserves a calmer reflection, exactly because it may be so that, again, it may be well the case that we get into the possibility of becoming a generalist only after being, in the first place, being somebody that does something already, perhaps more that runs more like a specialist first, in a way or another. And where we are going next, which I shall frame part of my story of starting as a specialist, is to exactly debug the being, the specialist, to set us to rest assured that all beings formed are formed first because the enter the becoming in the first place; although in many situations we miss the means of becoming, we generally take for granted, the movement, see fail to see the dots connecting (in alighment with Stebe Jobs point.) This is a general flaw perhaps in our educational system, in many cultures, perhaps linked to the fact that we are educated, as adults, in ways to miss the value of becoming.

As you recall I brought a bit from the history of Netscape when exploring the theme of bundle and unbundle. You may remember too that the idea of bundle was given to me from the action, from the field, from the job, that fast-paced place where words and terms and expressions, and ways to do things, are thrown at us, logically to somebody that is wanted, faster hands. Speaking of fast hands of the west and remembering these days in Silicon Valley, I won't ever forget the day when our team was about to change because our manager were leaving the spot. He called us to the meeting room and had technical keywords to be given to most of us. We are changing, so let us find who will do what, okay? Who knows JavaScript? The JavaScript expert was known so we all pointed to Bob, actually to the Polycom conference phone at the center of the table since Bob was in the east coast. Who knows DOM? I raised my hands fast, I loved DOM. But then all the five keywords were fired, and picked by our fast hands, except that we were six. Marie, you will be their manager. The meeting was over. We were back to our cubicles, my hands were back to the keyboard. 

The prose which I am pushing here, with the story my own job at Netsscape, carries a tone of suspiction, setting the stage for the reflections that must be in order so that we can access the generalist or to unbundle our fast-paced work situation. But I am exactly bringing the story in this order, specialist first and generalist later, because this is the order of life as we know it, that we can only become after being first. In other words, we should first celebrate the opportunity where the next rises from the now. With that, an intern can be working alongside a skilled doctor and can pass a complex tool that is critically necessary for the next job step of a heart surgery. Thus, even if our spinning globe seems somewhat arbitrary, it seems plausible to celebrate the goods of life when we have the chance to be the young pieces thrown into something that is pre-bundled, running. Of course, then we will follow up later with reflections about escaping from these nets.  





When I was thrown at Netscape I was excited. But moments before, while in the university, I knew that I was a sort of not so normal student. Seeing by collegues as creative being, was an optimistic viewpoint. Wearing an unusual outfit and generally in the lab, was something else. I got in in 1993, when the movie Jurrassic Park was out and the Internet was exciting plus the browser was new as we have discussed. I had reasons to be in the lab and not to pay attention to the classes. It was a Computer Science course by the way. 

Approaching eight years, by 2000, after having accumulated more university friends than usual, and likely a life debt to the Brazilian government for paying the bill, I was finally invited to an internship at Netscape, that browser making company helping the world to navigate the Web. After joining Netscape, I might have normalized myself, in a way. I felt as a being, as somebody. There were too many new things, and excitement, and new systems in place keeping me in the line, in a way. I didn't want to make the same "mistake" which I did in the University, in the sense of "taking eight years" to complete the course. That was a sort of tought, so I wanted to be professional in a way. I knew my best and my beast but I was fine to be educated. I were in a new country too, right? I was okay to become a listener in a way since I respected them too much, that place which I had an opinion, a place which I trusted, since somehow Silicon Valley was like a home I knew. And it makes sense, doesn't? And it isn't bad, isn't it? 

With the good things in place, and being somebody, I may have in a way entered into a path which many enter when they face the reality of jobs, when we embrace certain ways of operation tied to a culture. We sort of embrace the mechanics of it to a point that what they do, and how they do, is affected by that. That is nothing much wrong about that, perhaps, except that we seem to be captivated by the operational model which eventually seems to prevent us to do come out with new ideas when it is needed. The thing with the normal course of jobs is perhaps not much different of what the screenwriting professor Robert McKee said about the situation that young screenwriters face, after they learn how to use clichés. In an interview given to Indie Film Hustle, McKee pinpoints a critical trap that new screenwriters often fall as they craft their narratives - their reliance on clichés: While they aim to create original art they also understand that they cannot entirely reinvent the wheel. The reliance on clichés, however, leads to a phenomenon where "once they sell their soul, it's hard to get it back" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 10:36).

@note 
McKee also points a related concern where the writer fails the writer's duty of expressing the truth of the human condition. Or, as he puts it, "they think that because it is fiction, they have a license to lie" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 12:02). He warns of the perils of resorting to clichés and of losing one's authentic voice in an attempt to please the audience. As McKee puts it, "Of all those things, cliches and [lack of] truthfulness, are all the byproduct of the young writer's desire to please" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 13:08).

That wasn't different for me. I found a place where people seem to climb using certain skills, or clichés, or ways or operational models. I sort tried to figure the general function of climbing. Actually, I didn't try to do that on my own, as in counsiously as in trying to hack the system or trying to find a legit way to play the game. The system in itself were telling me to operate, in a way, with things such as performance reviews and the nuances from the hallways that seem to be telling me what to do and how to do. But it should be noted that the system wasn't really telling me explicitelly all of that; that I was behaving in some new ways from how I saw things, from a perspective which I likely nurtured from likely not reflecting properly. 

To some extent, I felt I was distancing from a being, from a being of before. A major problem was that I didn't know what was that thing I had before which I needed to keep alive. It wasn't difficult to see talents, or skills, some of the things which I brought as I were hired, things recognized by the eyes of an audience which sometimes give to us a few claps. To think of the traits and characteristics we bring, and how far (or superficial) the work places deals with these, set us at the footsteps to reflect about the paradox of one that is locked in the specialist room and struggles to escape to the generalist room. For me, that half-key which was in my mind and stuck for years, was given by a cumpliment from an employee that once said: Marcio, whatever you are smoking, please keep doing that. 

If I were smoking I would know. But I wasn't. While I sensed a hint I was too focused in looking at things "through the eyes of man", generally executing life too fast, too fast to know anyway, being one in the first place, fine, but anyway not able to see through. In other words, it was difficult to see in the carpet which I was were using to fly how it was linkedin to the thread I once had in my hands. What I felt fits well the complexity of the learning situation given by Steve Jobs's speech which I brought before, when we can't see the dots while doing, while being. It was, for me, through the reflective moments which I found later, and likely the celebration that magic and flying carpets comes from prior threads, that spoke just like the saying of Stephen Schwartz speaks to us, *Through Heaven's Eyes* from The Prince of Egypt, and whispers a truth that will take us to escape from the specialist room: 

> *"A single thread in a tapestry - Though its color brightly shine - Can never see its purpose - In the pattern of the grand design. And the stone that sits on the very top - Of the mountain's mighty face - Does it think it's more important - Than the stones that form the base? So how can you see what your life is worth? Or where your value lies? You can never see through the eyes of man. You must look at your life. Look at your life through heaven's eyes."* (Schwartz, n.d.)

--> 






The fact that heaven generally comes handy to tip some of us about the threads we can't see that leads to a tapestry, holds a lot more to the solution that may have less to do with our quick perceptions of us being distracted with symbols of Gods or heaven. What it holds, a punch in the face, is exactly that we looking with the "eyes of man," or the reality of now. It is impressive how we miss the point of all ideas asking us to transcend, and miss being suspicious of the realities of now. I was too eager, surfing on skills, to know and to celebrate the many single threads that brought me make a carpet. When our companies tell us to "keep doing that, whatever you are smoking," we are looking through the eyes of man. What we run, indeed, with that fast-paced life, is running the risk of missing the existance of a well.  

The well is the thing that makes you unique, the experience given by the threads we mess up with, even in arbitrary ways. My eight years in the university I likely were pouring things into that well. The rise of the browser, the movie Jurrassic Park, the prior movements and movies, the prior experiences, the personal computer rising as I were growing, the struggles, the challenges. It is, to a great extent, sad that talent and skills, the prior experience is projected in thing like a résumé. When we sort make us like a product, to fit, we set ourselves to do it, we do it then, we run, and we can vomit to some extent, indeed. It may work, for a while. But the more do not recognize the need to look at our lives not from the eyes of man - as we made it - the more we miss accounting that becoming of the new being demands a nurturing a well. We aren't products, as in of the shelf products. We are beings. And we need to preserve that so that we can pay attention to the movement that set us into the becoming from the being. In other words, we miss the notion of being aware of the dots, of appreciating the dots which are there from the being there, from the being somebody, from studying, from working, from living even if not especially when the living conditions are challenging.

The situation leads to a sort of fusion with the art being done, empty, which is far from the situation known as artist's block. But the founder's block goes all the way towards the identity - they can't become the somebody new because they don't know what made their somebody present in the first place. In the search for maintaing the self across the challenging setting, we shall count with the wisdom of Julia Cameron, the author of *The Artist's Way* and *The Right to Write*. For Julia, the true writer, that is committed to being a writer, pulls her things to write from a well (1998, p.66), as in the source, which does well for a while. But as a result of their success, of pulling things from that well, which is part of the job of writing, they find that their well goes empty. 

It is certainly the case of a beginner founder, like a beginner writer, especially the ones in a fast-paced movement, to not know how dependent they are of some well, in some place, of certain experiences, of certain sources, such as to a greater extent. The prompt that Julia Cameron promotes, which depends on nurturing that well, works for a writing life indeed. But it can be a good reflection for the life of an entrepreneur or anyone that wants to achieve lasting success. She wrote, from Right to Write: 

> *"If we are invested in a writing life - as opposed to a writing career - then we are in it for the process and not for the product. We are in it for the body of work and not for the quick hit of one well-realized piece. This means we must treat ourselves as valued athletes who must be kept in condition and not overraced or overtrained."*  (Julia Cameron, 1998, p.66)

The provocation of Julia lifts us towards the reality that we can be fixed, or obsessed, with that "one well-realized piece," ignoring what brought us there, the place and experiences we we certainly miss as likely a lot had appeared as arbitrary, as struggling moments, as chaotic too. Notice her differentiating life from career - Is that far from the phenomenon of when one is somebody hired, that had a life before, and then develops a career and then is losing it every day? She is asking writers, the ones that want to become good writers, do see the process beyond the present moment. When founders run their start-ups like careers, even when they join after coming from a great experience that brought them to start the project, they can't tell which places they have visited that served to them as the energy, or the source of creative power, and which helps them to be able to work, to deliver. 

Sometimes we can sort of bring the bits and pieces of it, but it isn't enough. We need to pause and reflect on us beyond the eyes of the work, the job, the routine, the specialist tracks. And worse, when founders - such as the ones that achieved known success - are interviewed about some good job they did, they are unable to skim the subject and really tell what brought them there in the first place. When we enter entrepreneurship, and perhaps anything in general, we generally bring some arbitrary notions of what we did before. We look into that hat and pull some bits and pieces from it, thinking that our success has nothing to do with that well, with the creation of that well, with the steps towards that well. But worse, we miss the fact that maintaining that well is key to our state of well-being, the well-being state that is necessary for the growth and challenging stages ahead.

What founders can't see, that brings them to the resulting phenomenon - or felling stalled and having perceptions such as "we are not motivated as we were" or "things are not working" or "the market is not accepting" and the many variations of that - is that we might have another underlying reason to be there, to being somebody, in that process. Missing that leads to missing the key into being the generalist. 

Julia pointed a situation of a television executive that started as a producer with a goal of doing good to the world but caught himself in a kind of existential crisis as his "inner reality and his outer world no longer mesh" (1998, p.108). She elaborated about his mechanism of crisis management consisting of a daily writing exercise that takes in consideration his value system, where he is okay with discomfort, where he states his dreams, where he brings the reality he faces, where he can be conscious about himself. The reflective writing exercise of the executive celebrates how one checks on his integrity.

The success we seek, ultimately, is not arrive at a scene as beings that somehow had stumbled in a state of well being; so that we brought ourselves in the readiness level where we can pull an idea of the hat and then success is measured from our ability to execute and deliver to the world, keep pulling from a hat. As the matter depends on embracing the creative state of well being - which is a requirement for entrepreneurship - we must seek to understand that success is success in the long run, that we need to nurture ourselves to be able to pull solutions from the well as much as keep experiencing and act to fill that well. And that such effort has to be done also at an individual level, for everyone involved. 



























According to Julia Cameron, in The Right to Write (1998, p.66), a writer that is committed to being a writer pulls things to write from a well, as in the source, and it does well for a while. But as a result of their success, of pulling things from that well and which is part of the job of writing, they find that their well goes empty. It could be that a beginner writer does not even know how dependent they are, of that well as a source. Like a young worker in the work place. That place, if they knew well enough how it works, would be considered sacred. But like for most of us, beginners in the craft of creation, it could be that that they went there, many times, that they visited that well, and then their body of experience brought them to a readiness level. When they are apt to spit the writing to the world. 






We could, perhaps think like that, if we had the time to ask that question. And it is not that we are not teased to reflect about that, such as when one gives us a cumpliment of the sort "whatever you are smoking please keep doing that" and the more or less exciting variations of that. But then, as this example shows, these words are strong enough to create such a wall between that (perhaps imaginary) well and our (in fact real) jobs. In other words, most of the work environments don't have time to deal with our sources, with what makes us unique, with what brought us there in the first place, to have ideas, to be motivated, to act on something, to work with an energy that flows. And again, the more we fall into the process of focusing in the outcome, the more we can't see that the outputs that we produce are tied to an input that has to do with the life of the human being behind that. The more we do that the more we disconnect from that well, the well we didn't know it existed in the first place. 

In other words, as any job unfolds, we don't have the time to talk about that well, or any well, or to visit us, to see us. That is too blurry. Such subject simply can't be part of the conversations in the job. And worse, the job conversations can take control of all to the point you think it is yourself. And it is all around because it is a process in us, to not talk about that. And we have a sort of reasoning for that - as approaching this subject is approaching a subject that we don't fully get what goes on there. We do not know how our machine - as humans - fully operate. We know that it does things and we sort of try to rationalize parts of it. And even after the fact that many good real doers, such as good writers and good producers, are telling us about the bits and pieces of how it works, still they do not give a straight and logical guide with a full control about how to operate, how we can control our process that can lead to outcomes. Some of the great minds, when they talk about that well, are more like saying that we depend on it to do our best work. Can we trust? Well, even if we do, we just don't have the time, not usually, not usually in the work place. We rather continue to do well, but under the terms that the job requires, as opposed to visit that other well that brought us to be who we are, the well of experiences. 

The prompt to success that Julia Cameron promotes, which depends on nurturing that well, works for a writing life of a writer and for the life of an entrepreneur or anyone that wants to achieve lasting success. She wrote, from Right to Write: 

> *"If we are invested in a writing life - as opposed to a writing career - then we are in it for the process and not for the product. We are in it for the body of work and not for the quick hit one one well-realized piece. This means we must treat ourselves as valued athletes who must be kept in condition and not overraced or overtrained."*  (Julia Cameron, 1998, p.66)

The provocation of Julia lifts us towards the reality about our idea for success in general. It also reveals our inclination to grab "one well-realized piece" ignoring what brought us there. Notice her differentiating life from career. Ins't it a bit like the phenomenon of a company that hired someone that had a life, before, and then develops a career? She is asking writers, the ones that want to become good writers, do see the process beyond the present moment. 

When founders run their start-ups like careers, even when they join after coming from a great experience that brought them to start the project, they can't tell which places they have visited that served to them as the energy, or the source of creative power, and which helps them to be able to work, to deliver. Sometimes we can sort of bring the bits and pieces of it. And worse, when founders are interviewed about some good job they did, they are unable to skim the subject and really tell what brought them there in the first place. We just enter entrepreneurship with some arbitrary notions of what we did before as if something was smoked. We enter entrepreneurship thinking that our success has nothing much to do with that well, and that that well has nothing to do with our well being. 

One may take a whole life before the readiness level of being able to launch something interesting. One may have visited that well, many wells, too many times. But then that one learns how to write down, or how to tell others, and start thinking that the process of putting it out is the key. Thinking that they hold a key. But eventually, with the key in hands, they might caught themselves unable to open new doors. They keep reopening the same doors. The work situation of that is that one eventually is let go. The writer situation of that is that the writer can't write another great work. The founder situation of that is that founders start to get bored as they find that first customers didn't like their early product, and the changes they produce don't seem to be as exciting as what they thought originally. Or going back to the blurry terms, the person seem to not be smoking anymore. 

The complication in there, although it starts with ourselves not knowing how to bring us into that good state, is that we don't account that time as valid time. The activity that Julia Cameron asks us to do is the sort of activity that starts with the courage because it starts alone. It can't be done with others, such as teams. Visiting the well, and visiting periodically, is about having a date with your internal being, your internal artist, you name it. See where we are going here? An artist, for an entrepreneur? Although weird, perhaps everyone knows it exists somewhere, that sinister thing we can't control or know properly, that partially shows its shadow when we went out and we did something different, perhaps a moment we had with ourselves when having an experience somewhere; that helped us the next day, that changed our minds and gave us a new door to try. 

But even when we sense that we dismiss that thing as not a subject associated with our jobs. The thinking of going for it, having a date with your inner artist, starts as an absurd - it will be onerous. Alone? I can't have time for alone. It might start there or with other objections as it does not fit life as we know it. Not the working life. See, Julia Cameron wrote books for artists and writers. She wrote that even for them is sounds eroneous. Now consider for founders, entrepreneurs, and the normal workers. It's not even a subject to be considered. 

But as we continue to refuse to understand how experiences affect us, we continue to operate as if we are in control, responsible beings, but we might be in fact behaving like gamblers. As in, one visited places and situations, acquired life experience somewhere, gains technical expertise, gets the job, does good, people applaud for her unique way of doing things, and the agenda continue do expect her to deliver from that unique being. She is not allowed to live any experience that is not direct tied to the act of delivery. Whatever she had, that seems to be related to talent, or creativity, is the - in normal work-job terms - her uniqueness. It comes as a cumpliment, the right to do nothing about that. It is a matter outside the job. Notice how we deal with this thing, this weird thing, how we put a wall in there. Better to make a cumpliment. You are special. But a lot of special people are being let go, after a while, working. 

Consider the work of a worker that came fresh from university into a new job, or the "work" of a team of founders that just met an investor. It's the same. What brought them to this winning condition? Whatever you did before. Congrats and welcome to the team. Let's now run faster. You can continue to use your talents, of course, your unique voice, your unique way. Bring your talents, it's okay, but we are not focusing much in developing talents. And we respect everyone aside from their uniqueness. Here matters more execution. We don't want to know what you did before. And we won't even say that too much, the cumplements about talents. It's unfair. Let's keep cranking.  

Which brings us to support the view of Julia Cameron, as a view that works for entrepreneurs as entrepreneurs do a craft that is like the craft of writers. The view that we support recognizes the complication that when one seeks to pursue success, they do not account the the origins of success, not properly. It is our natural inclication,for founders and writers and teams, to enter execution thinking that the "launching of things" is what matters although we might have taken that idea from somewhere else. The non linear nature for how new good ideas happen, or "what goes on with that well," can't be accounted. It is not a valid subject, it's not in the lean process. 

In other words, we are taking advantage of that well, or the process that individuals goes to that well. We want all them to have a life, before. Work spaces of all sorts welcomes that. As long as we keep that well on the other side of the wall. Even the best processes for managing productivity, we know by the top performing and quite creative companies, like Google, show signs that there is something more there. The modern version of OKR - objectives and key results, which is a system for managing how input (actions) ties with output (results) and comes with a system of evaluation against objectives - indicates two modes for operation: commitment and aspirational. The commitment approach is simple, where expected key expected results (of activities performed) are precise such as when one writes that she wants to contact 10 customers. The aspirational approach is when key results are less precise but associated with high expectations, of a soft of higher order, aspirational. In other words, the aspirational key results are there to pulls us to find our ways, which allow creativity to appear the scene. It is reported by great companies running with great teams that high expectations such as beyond reach, or as of aspirational nature, make them bring superb results. But it goes as far as that. Having an aspirational goal does not account that the performer shall visit places to fills her well. It assumes that the person is in good condition to pull things from an existing well. 

But for entrepreneurs, such as founders, we can't ignore that function, that there is a well - which we sort of know - and that you need to fill your well as part of your process. You might need to face the fact that your project depends on your visits to certain places, such as dates with an artist, your inner artist. The situation pointed by Julia for writers is quite applicable to the journey of founders, and entrepreneurs, as founders are in a quest to deliver what wasn't written, what wasn't said, what wasn't done, or produced. As we move towards creating our products, and testing the various elements in it that may serve the needs for the world, we are depending on a creative ecosystem in us, as individuals and as teams. That because, as we have seen it, no plan survives the contact with first customers [^steveblankfootnote2], which put us in the place, in front of the necessity, to be creative again and again. We can't pull from the well if we can't fill the well. 

[^steveblankfootnote2]: As indicated, Steve Blank suggests the idea to illustrate that entrepreneurs launch ideas first and need to adapt to the realities of the market.

### Interconnected well-being 

What founders can't see, not as clearly as they move with the process, is that their behavior to engage to the development of an idea has ties with what they discovered before as they got involved with experiences in the world in the first place. Which aligns with the saying "it all starts with a problem you want to solve" [^userinnovationhint]. So they move, start failing and iterating, and things seem to change somehow when the idealized concretes start to fail, as in not accepted by the judges, such as the early people that they have contacted to get feedback, and themselves or other judges. But as they pour more energy, and deliver more concretes to the observers, and the world continues to not respond as expected, their movement with the process naturally pulls them into a place of executing their job without noticing that revising sources of energy (experiences that pulls creative effort) will contribute to the process. The resulting phenomenon is that is brings them into the state of felling stalled and having perceptions such as "we are not motivated as we were" or "things are not working" or "the market is not accepting" and the many variations of that. 

[^userinnovationhint]: The concept of User Innovation (2015, May 19), and the work of Eric von Hippel, involves the idea that people modify tools or create new solutions after the fact that they want to solve real problems.

And worse is when we think that it is the very specific idea, as we have sort of concretized in our minds, the one we pulled from that well, which was the big thing. As in, we become to proud of being the ones that delivered, the ones that have pulled a great thing from that well, that we dismiss that we are the ones that filled the well in the first place. That we gave us a chance to find a problem, to see a problem, in the first place. 

The success we seek, ultimately, is not arrive at a scene as beings that somehow had stumbled in a state of well being; so that we brought ourselves in the readiness level where we can pull an idea of the hat, or a well, and then success is measured from our ability to execute and deliver to the world. As the matter depends on embracing the creative state of well being - which is a requirement for entrepreneurship - we must seek to understand that success is success in the long run, that we need to nurture ourselves to be able to pull solutions from the well as much as keep experiencing and act to fill that well. And that such effort has to be done also at an individual level, for everyone involved.

COntinue to support this with the work of Maslow and entrepreneurship 
In case it seems confusing that creativity now was brought into this article about success, I want to position in in the right direction with a little help from Maslow, add more precision to make a point that the entrepreneur depends on a state of less control which basically connects with the notion of the creative state. Consider the words of Maslow:
