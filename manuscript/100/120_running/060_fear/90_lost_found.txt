#### child favorable environment 

(2011, p.56), Abraham Maslow considers a formula for growth where once the child sees a favorable environment (for children would be parents, therapists, teachers) and other safe conditions, then they essentially compares the attractiveness for the progressive choice versus the negative aspects for the regressive choice.

#### employees, of hypnotizhed 

Another point must be said about how the mature being, the grown-up team, does deal with some the regulation of the whole being being formed by its underlying entities. Andy had pointed in *Only the Paranoid Survive* that the leadership may or may not deal with the change - and the likelyhood of replacement - but pointing the implicit duty of leadership. As for the legs, the entities, the working units which are too focusing, Andy makes a point that in these situations heads are generally replaced gexactly from the implied corporate situation and the assumed specialized characterizations of the entites as working units which can't do much for change - nor the big corporation has the means to support the recharacterization of the individual units. Thus it may be seen as the natural deprecation of leafs when the root dynamics serve different life liquids where the leaves don't understand; they die which in the corporate working world, they are fired, let go. The reason I end with this reflection is that some of the complex characterizations may actually go on, keep the beat, by bypassing the feelings or unconscious development through pathways which founders live by. In other words, by replacing, it may be assumed that the whole bean is to a certain extent being hypnotizhed, free of the pains, renewed, not carrying a painful memory. 



#### Post in social, Marcio's story 

In this process, the cost to be paid may first appear as not so damaging, as in to be seen as a team wasting energy or time. And this is so too exactly because these mediuns are driven to positive interactions too. Thus, the real case of a test of the sociometer in action may show how happy the team becomes after a comment from someone successful, like an influencer. Next is myself being happy that an investor liked my post: 

> *"I don't forget my first user who commented on a post on my channel 'Uncle of the Valley,' about entrepreneurship. It was the angel investor João Kepler. In fact, that day, I had sent a post to a friend who knew João Kepler and tagged him. João Kepler liked the post. It was very cool."* – Marcio S Galli, https://www.instagram.com/tiodovale

While potential results can be great - my self esteem was high that day - we too see that these practical actions are low cost. But in our mind, in the world of our narratives, we are connected to that, and it may too consume us. The price we pay for increasing our network, our channels, is becoming attached to the narrative that grows, many of them fragmented first, but moving the needle anyway, such as the total number of followers or a comment from someone special. We become dependent on the narrative as a whole, and it can change our behavior. The more we watch what we sign up for, such as our numbers, the more we believe that our entrepreneurship occurs and that it may be given by that kind of data. But the cost to be paid is not in the possibility of the project's failure if these signals do not resonate with the reality and truths the business or project will face. The cost is in the emotional condition we reach when we face disappointment or when, despite the peaks of dopamine and excitement, we are still pursuing the larger goal that is not resolved day by day. With this, we can find ourselves cornered, or letting time pass, without considering another environment and believing that environment is real.

Diverging or transcending?
-->

What we can take away from this, once again, is a simple idea but one that we cannot ignore—we are human, we feel, and we will likely coordinate our entrepreneurial actions based on emotions. However, this doesn't mean we can't take time to recognize and reflect on all this. If the former Intel CEO recognizes that he was escaping from a larger problem by writing a book, could it be that we also sometimes engage in certain responsible actions as a form of blocking or self-defense to avoid feeling loss or strong emotions like fear and insecurity?

* "With all the rhetoric about how management is about change, the fact is that we managers loathe change, especially when it involves us. Getting to a strategic inflection point involves confusion, uncertainty and disorder, both on a personal level if you are in management and on a strategic level for the enterprise as a whole. These two levels are more intimately connected than one might think." Andy Grove, p.123, Only the Paranoid Survive. 

* We should also consider that the corporate version goes through the very exercise of transcending, such as when these companies fall into the modes of bets (check the usage of various levels of bets by the following paper article ft. Andy Grove). The consideration of a new style changing strategy, is then the realization of the need for transcending, searching a wider view - writing a book, acquision of companies, pre-mortem, you name it.

It comes through experimentation. Loosen up the level of control that the organization normally is accustomed to.

Much as management has been devoted to making and keeping order in the company, at times like this they must become more tolerant of the new and the different. Only stepping out of the old ruts will bring new insights." Andy Grove, p.130, Only the Paranoid Survive 

* Note - To know or not to know - feat. Maslow - "In any case, this close relationship between knowing and doing can help us to interpret one cause of the fear of knowing as deeply a fear of doing, a fear of the consequences that flow from knowing, a fear of its dangerous responsibilities. Often it is better not to know, because if you did know, then you would have to act and stick your neck out. This is a little involved, a little like the man who said, "I'm so glad I don't like oysters, because if I liked oysters, I'd eat them, and I'd hate the darn things'" p.63 Toward the Psychology of Being.

If she disappears and he becomes frightened, the curiosity disappears until safety is restored. She explores only out of a safe harbor." p.61 of Toward the Psychology of Being. Note: The note from Maslow, by indicating the child situation, the connection is too direct between safety and the act to learn, to go seek, to discover. Logically, in the adult that is not at risk of losing its safety needs; but the point is that these models are used for risk movements, curious movements; it is coherent anyway to seek the new only when you can be safe about the mechanisms that let you seek in the first place. In p.54-55 Maslow also points the "subjective device" that is added to "principle of the hierarchical arrangements of our various needs," which may explain in part how our models for growth from the child are mapped as models to the adult growth.  This may also have to do with any psicanalysis generally goes back to childhood to explain to the adult that the mechanism does not need to apply. 

* #greatness #hubris #fright Note - * To know, acessing - "The moment of fright is quite understandable, but must nevertheless be overcome if creation is to be possible. Thus, to discover in oneself a great talent can certainly bring exhilaration, but it also brings a fear of the dangers and responsibilities and duties of being a leader and of being all alone. Responsibility can be seen as a heavy burden and evaded as long as possible. Think of the mixture of feelings of awe, humility, even of fright that have been reported to us, let us say, by people who have been elected president." Maslow p 58-59

* #hubris - On fear of hubris - or greatness - For the individual level this might have been better reflected; of a fear that is different from that fear of knowing, and the fear of responsibilty (feat. Maslow, Toward the Psychology of Being). The fear of hubris may be a fear of the established system's fear of the chaos which may be applicable to the individuals, or the individual units of a system, willing and interested in growth. When in doubt, about to grow big or to be struck, some of these may be stuck due to an outstanding suggestion by whoever controls a path for the societal system, asking to not access the Gods, to not go too far (this may be a view presented by Maslow). This in the view of Dorothea, could be related, she points the case that professors of writing generally in the very first lecture put upfront that genious cannot be taught, which Dorothea disagree. Her book, becoming a writer, is for that. The fear of Hubris might happen to be the esteem level regulator esteem-level editor? while the fear of knowledge and responsibility acting on other level? 

    * Self-esteem regulating "Therefore, we speak simply of fear of knowledge in general without discriminating to sharply fear of the inner from the fear of the outer. In general, this kind of fear is defensive in the sense that it is a protection of our self-esteem, of our love and respect for ourselves. We tend to be afraid of any knowledge that could cause us to despise ourselves or to make us inferior, weak, worthless, evil, shameful. We protect ourselves and our ideal image of ourselves by repression and similar defenses, which are essentially techniques by which we avoid becoming conscious of unpleasant or dangerous truths." p.57 Maslow in Toward the Psychology of Being

Andy Grove also articulated a corporate version of the potential for loss, self-defense—a situation where companies going through said inflection points decide to buy other companies. He questioned, in "Only the Paranoid Survive," why Japanese electronics companies, undergoing significant changes in their markets and industry, bought movie studios. For Grove, this could represent a form of escapism that ends up completely occupying managers' attention; they become too busy, they want to be occupied.





#### Sir Ken and Grove

For me it is inescapable to think of the adult form, or the educated ones, which we have considered from Sir Ken Robison, the notion that "by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity." That too, the not unlike us beings, our corporate beast or being, will grow its own educated form, from its prior sucesses, and will set themselves into being frightened of being wrong:

> *"Business people are not just managers, they are also human. They have emotions and a lot of their emotions are tied up in the identity and well-being of their businesses. If you are a senior manager, you probably got to where you are because you have devoted a large portion of your life to your trade, to your industry and to your company. In many instances, your personal identity is inseparable from your life work. So, when your business gets into serious difficulties, in spite of the best attempts of business schools and management training courses to make you a rational analyzer of data, objective analysis will take second seat to personal and emotional reactions almost every time."* (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 123-124)

#### correlation


<!-- 
@outline - Mapping out all the situations? 
--> 

A note to consider the comparison between the being right case of the individual and the true of sorrow case of their startup and the valley of death case of Andy Grove. In all the situations we have the phenomenon where the doer, the one that get things done, the entity, the being that get things done is involved in following the market. Here the young writer establishing the critics on top of the potential being, the creative being, the startup by interacting with external environment, seeking approval, struggles with the realities where the outcome producing may not truly satisfy in the struggles of presenting and adapting to the critics, forcing themselves in the block situation and in similar ways the case of Andy Grove of a major corporation going through the valley of death is essentially about what Andy Grove referred as a corporation that achieved a degree of success or what he calls the inertia of success and then the inflection point required because of the 10x force which might be a new configuration to the environment given by the new setting of the competitive forces. In other words, a movement, a prior movement given by competitive forces is insufficient given that the audience demands are reconfigured. It is the attempt to control success and how we regulate that control that tells what's going to happen essentially.


It may not be so far anyway from the trough of sorrow brought before, that situation of a startup essentially talking with the market, projecting its offering, being excited and then realizing the need to commit to a sort of doing again. But while that valley involves a story in the early stage, this valley of death is the equivalent the huge entity - like Intel - which happens to be already living its maturity, had lived from its prior successes, which essentially goes well with the proper possibility as an output - potential death.

> *"If you are a middle manager, many of the same considerations apply, but very often your job is also at stake. How your corporation succeeds in working its way through a strategic inflection point may determine what happens to your career."*

In conclusion, 

> *"And I'm advocating basically doing the same concept of strategic analysis and apply it to your career. And foremost among those is watch for strategic inflection points. Work on separating the signal from the noise. And we complete, conclude that it's signal. Experiment first and then pull in the reins and commit yourself. And discipline yourself to overcome the denial and the various other human foibles that will come in the way in your own career, as well as in your business"* (Grove, 2019, 43:07-46:03).

#### Kids counts to 100 

To note: We are talking about a senior manager, an educator, a chemical engineer, a reader of manager to name some characterizations of Andy. Clearly telling us that it happens like that, that we become and by becoming we get stuck. And when we get stuck, we defend ourselves. And when we defend, it may appear - although in retrospect - to be movements of a child:  

> *"When the environment changees in such a way as to render the old skills and strenghts less relevant, we almost instinctively cling to our past. We refuse to acknowledge changes around us, almost like a child who doesn't like what he's seeing so he closes his eyes and counts to 100 and figures that what bothered him will go away. We too close our eyes and are willing to work harder, to dedicate ourselves to our traditional tasks or skills, in the hope that they and hard work will get us there by the count of 100. "* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

#### Faith 

But back to the future of now, the metaphor that fears move mountains makes sense as decisions in the knowledge economy, especially in the digital landscape, are not disconnected from what we perceive, what we think, and what we feel. The mountain of now can be the pile of resources, such as money, or time. The wolves of now can be the competitor. And your organization is the tree of now, where we can go up and down, and hoping to survive. And we you do so, my hope that we can have the time to reflect, first, and to come down from that tree and paint about that situation-complication, to help ourselves with a reflection and the next generation helping us. 


#### Controlling creativity 

<!--
@outline - Controlling creativity, not chaos, but transcending with chaotic possibly 
--> 

Trying to control success is not a problem. But it may be so in the circumstances when the creative state is needed. For a potential writer, to think about the colorful, or unconscious, or daring, or bad writing as a path for a writer's path, is bad because of its uncertain path. For one that expects to be a writer, it is perhaps not an allowed path. Why? Because it can be far, it can be difficult, it can be painful, perhaps wasteful. Perhaps because the path towards what is uncertain is a tougher path, perhaps lacking responsibility, perhaps sounds like the steps of a gambler thus not the shortest path to success.  

But the goal, in reducing the controller, is not about encouranging the bad, or the arbitrary, and the colorful, as in for the sake of executing chaos, as if total chaos means creativity. But it may be essentially about creating the support conditions that set us free from the the extremme, the controller that allows no room for errors, for testing, for experiencing, for checking other views. 

In this regard, I would like to bring a concrete contribution from Maslow from *Maslow on Management*. When he refers to the creative being, the being that does not control the outcome. But see, the creative is not random too. He or she is just outside the pressure system of trying to control: 

> *"Need to pick the Reference of quotation and page for this Maslow of Management article about the creative person."*

-->

This allowing may set the team into joyful findings, if we put ourselves into the possibility. Thus, this is about having fun too, as a path. A gentlemen which I met in the bus one day asked me to organize the company, the room, without worrying about the outcome, that things would work in the end. I felt something big there as in "do not control". In the releasing control, as an exercise of process, we can find joy too, a calmness. What if we can do that perhaps "once a day" as opposed to "once a year" or "once the week" as opposed to "once a month". See, going back to recognizing the axis of the free and creative (not right) versus the controled and right way, we can unleash us into the "moments of relaxation" which may in fact set us into having clear views about the whole thing. 

#### Fears and faith mountains 


If the biblical passage had a typo in it and it had been said that fear, instead of faith, as the thing that move mountains [^footnote_biblical_faith_mountains], it would be literally applicable to our days since we are the ones moving a pile of resources, in the fast-paced way, grain by grain, bit by bit, byte by byte, from a place to another. For that, using a subjective language of action where we run from trouble given our fears: fear to fail, to be fired, to not be associated with success. But the passage uses faith instead and because of that it transcends the moment we live, it is stronger. For me, when I can't solve a problem, I generally think about faith, or hope. For me, it is a way to sometimes not enter into the trouble of trying to understand the unsolvable. 

[^footnote_biblical_faith_mountains]: This reference is to a biblical passage, specifically Matthew 17:20, where it is stated, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

<!-- 
@note * Fears vs. Faith - was broutht by Marcio. In the introduction, of the section Fears, Marcio has suggested a metaphor, that "fear can move mountains." Then, he objects to it, by saying that, perhaps not, that in fact fear can build faith. Although a bit coherent, this saying were lacking substance, or connection, as if it was metaphorical but not fundamented. But then, when reading Maslow's book "Toward a Psychology of Being," the section Entitled "Need to Know and Fear of Knowing," Maslow refers to a kind of fear that's different from the fear of knowledge, that is a fear of us becoming too great. And it seems to be that such fear is an attack, comes from an attack of the environment, of the superior, that to some, or perhaps a great, extent induces the subordinate to not become like Gods or greater. Maslow indicates that religions and other systems brings a kind of message about the dangers of allowing us to enter the space of knowledge, the dangers of letting us to become curious, the dangers of curiosity, the dangers of being Gods, or geniuses. And he suggests the trace, a preference for things like faith and belief and piety rather than knowledge. Or the feeling that some forms of knowledge were too dangerous to meddle with and had best be forbidden or reserved to a few special people.

#### The works in the head - the experience in the head 


Perhaps this association is common in the world of artists or those involved in creative works. But it serves us well to reflect that a lot of what people do start in their heads, in a black box.

Thus, relevant in the entrepreneur's context is the censorship that becomes decisive, even though we don't  acknowledge fears. But our fears from situations like dreaming, reflecting, or planning, can quickly engage a self-censor. In other words, our fears might act behind the scenes although it impacts a world of possibilities, which might limit what we do. Dealing with these subject it not a simple task, such as of asking technical help or even reading book, because it involves taking initiative and to engage in reflective thinking, to put things in perspective, such as what comes from reflective writing or other related processes that involves asking for help, just like one would when one enters a session with a psychoterapeut, or a coach, or board members.  

Author Julia Cameron, known for her book The Artist's Way (1992), assists artists from various fields in navigating their creative potentials and blocks. Her 12-week course, which is outlined in the book, includes what is an apparently a simple exercise of "morning pages," consisting of writing long hand-written pages every morning; an essentially liberating practice that exercises the mind, much like a gym for the body, allowing the censoring side of the mind to cease stifling creativity. It's a technique that encourages making mistakes, experiencing fears, beginning with granting oneself permission.

Through Julia's explanations, we can see how she discovered this technique throughout her career. She was a recognized artist in Hollywood who, at some point, had her work rejected. In her account of the emotions she experienced, she likened the feeling of her work's rejection to the loss of a pregnancy.
