@outline - Mapping out all the situations? 
--> 

A note to consider the comparison between the being right case of the individual and the true of sorrow case of their startup and the valley of death case of Andy Grove. In all the situations we have the phenomenon where the doer, the one that get things done, the entity, the being that get things done is involved in following the market. Here the young writer establishing the critics on top of the potential being, the creative being, the startup by interacting with external environment, seeking approval, struggles with the realities where the outcome producing may not truly satisfy in the struggles of presenting and adapting to the critics, forcing themselves in the block situation and in similar ways the case of Andy Grove of a major corporation going through the valley of death is essentially about what Andy Grove referred as a corporation that achieved a degree of success or what he calls the inertia of success and then the inflection point required because of the 10x force which might be a new configuration to the environment given by the new setting of the competitive forces. In other words, a movement, a prior movement given by competitive forces is insufficient given that the audience demands are reconfigured. It is the attempt to control success and how we regulate that control that tells what's going to happen essentially.


It may not be so far anyway from the trough of sorrow brought before, that situation of a startup essentially talking with the market, projecting its offering, being excited and then realizing the need to commit to a sort of doing again. But while that valley involves a story in the early stage, this valley of death is the equivalent the huge entity - like Intel - which happens to be already living its maturity, had lived from its prior successes, which essentially goes well with the proper possibility as an output - potential death.

> *"If you are a middle manager, many of the same considerations apply, but very often your job is also at stake. How your corporation succeeds in working its way through a strategic inflection point may determine what happens to your career."*

In conclusion, 

> *"And I'm advocating basically doing the same concept of strategic analysis and apply it to your career. And foremost among those is watch for strategic inflection points. Work on separating the signal from the noise. And we complete, conclude that it's signal. Experiment first and then pull in the reins and commit yourself. And discipline yourself to overcome the denial and the various other human foibles that will come in the way in your own career, as well as in your business"* (Grove, 2019, 43:07-46:03).

#### Kids counts to 100 

To note: We are talking about a senior manager, an educator, a chemical engineer, a reader of manager to name some characterizations of Andy. Clearly telling us that it happens like that, that we become and by becoming we get stuck. And when we get stuck, we defend ourselves. And when we defend, it may appear - although in retrospect - to be movements of a child:  

> *"When the environment changees in such a way as to render the old skills and strenghts less relevant, we almost instinctively cling to our past. We refuse to acknowledge changes around us, almost like a child who doesn't like what he's seeing so he closes his eyes and counts to 100 and figures that what bothered him will go away. We too close our eyes and are willing to work harder, to dedicate ourselves to our traditional tasks or skills, in the hope that they and hard work will get us there by the count of 100. "* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

#### Faith 

But back to the future of now, the metaphor that fears move mountains makes sense as decisions in the knowledge economy, especially in the digital landscape, are not disconnected from what we perceive, what we think, and what we feel. The mountain of now can be the pile of resources, such as money, or time. The wolves of now can be the competitor. And your organization is the tree of now, where we can go up and down, and hoping to survive. And we you do so, my hope that we can have the time to reflect, first, and to come down from that tree and paint about that situation-complication, to help ourselves with a reflection and the next generation helping us. 


#### Controlling creativity 

<!--
@outline - Controlling creativity, not chaos, but transcending with chaotic possibly 
--> 

Trying to control success is not a problem. But it may be so in the circumstances when the creative state is needed. For a potential writer, to think about the colorful, or unconscious, or daring, or bad writing as a path for a writer's path, is bad because of its uncertain path. For one that expects to be a writer, it is perhaps not an allowed path. Why? Because it can be far, it can be difficult, it can be painful, perhaps wasteful. Perhaps because the path towards what is uncertain is a tougher path, perhaps lacking responsibility, perhaps sounds like the steps of a gambler thus not the shortest path to success.  

But the goal, in reducing the controller, is not about encouranging the bad, or the arbitrary, and the colorful, as in for the sake of executing chaos, as if total chaos means creativity. But it may be essentially about creating the support conditions that set us free from the the extremme, the controller that allows no room for errors, for testing, for experiencing, for checking other views. 

In this regard, I would like to bring a concrete contribution from Maslow from *Maslow on Management*. When he refers to the creative being, the being that does not control the outcome. But see, the creative is not random too. He or she is just outside the pressure system of trying to control: 

> *"Need to pick the Reference of quotation and page for this Maslow of Management article about the creative person."*

This allowing may set the team into joyful findings, if we put ourselves into the possibility. Thus, this is about having fun too, as a path. A gentlemen which I met in the bus one day asked me to organize the company, the room, without worrying about the outcome, that things would work in the end. I felt something big there as in "do not control". In the releasing control, as an exercise of process, we can find joy too, a calmness. What if we can do that perhaps "once a day" as opposed to "once a year" or "once the week" as opposed to "once a month". See, going back to recognizing the axis of the free and creative (not right) versus the controled and right way, we can unleash us into the "moments of relaxation" which may in fact set us into having clear views about the whole thing. 

#### Fears and faith mountains 


If the biblical passage had a typo in it and it had been said that fear, instead of faith, as the thing that move mountains [^footnote_biblical_faith_mountains], it would be literally applicable to our days since we are the ones moving a pile of resources, in the fast-paced way, grain by grain, bit by bit, byte by byte, from a place to another. For that, using a subjective language of action where we run from trouble given our fears: fear to fail, to be fired, to not be associated with success. But the passage uses faith instead and because of that it transcends the moment we live, it is stronger. For me, when I can't solve a problem, I generally think about faith, or hope. For me, it is a way to sometimes not enter into the trouble of trying to understand the unsolvable. 

[^footnote_biblical_faith_mountains]: This reference is to a biblical passage, specifically Matthew 17:20, where it is stated, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

<!-- 
@note * Fears vs. Faith - was broutht by Marcio. In the introduction, of the section Fears, Marcio has suggested a metaphor, that "fear can move mountains." Then, he objects to it, by saying that, perhaps not, that in fact fear can build faith. Although a bit coherent, this saying were lacking substance, or connection, as if it was metaphorical but not fundamented. But then, when reading Maslow's book "Toward a Psychology of Being," the section Entitled "Need to Know and Fear of Knowing," Maslow refers to a kind of fear that's different from the fear of knowledge, that is a fear of us becoming too great. And it seems to be that such fear is an attack, comes from an attack of the environment, of the superior, that to some, or perhaps a great, extent induces the subordinate to not become like Gods or greater. Maslow indicates that religions and other systems brings a kind of message about the dangers of allowing us to enter the space of knowledge, the dangers of letting us to become curious, the dangers of curiosity, the dangers of being Gods, or geniuses. And he suggests the trace, a preference for things like faith and belief and piety rather than knowledge. Or the feeling that some forms of knowledge were too dangerous to meddle with and had best be forbidden or reserved to a few special people.

#### The works in the head - the experience in the head 


Perhaps this association is common in the world of artists or those involved in creative works. But it serves us well to reflect that a lot of what people do start in their heads, in a black box.

Thus, relevant in the entrepreneur's context is the censorship that becomes decisive, even though we don't  acknowledge fears. But our fears from situations like dreaming, reflecting, or planning, can quickly engage a self-censor. In other words, our fears might act behind the scenes although it impacts a world of possibilities, which might limit what we do. Dealing with these subject it not a simple task, such as of asking technical help or even reading book, because it involves taking initiative and to engage in reflective thinking, to put things in perspective, such as what comes from reflective writing or other related processes that involves asking for help, just like one would when one enters a session with a psychoterapeut, or a coach, or board members.  

Author Julia Cameron, known for her book The Artist's Way (1992), assists artists from various fields in navigating their creative potentials and blocks. Her 12-week course, which is outlined in the book, includes what is an apparently a simple exercise of "morning pages," consisting of writing long hand-written pages every morning; an essentially liberating practice that exercises the mind, much like a gym for the body, allowing the censoring side of the mind to cease stifling creativity. It's a technique that encourages making mistakes, experiencing fears, beginning with granting oneself permission.

Through Julia's explanations, we can see how she discovered this technique throughout her career. She was a recognized artist in Hollywood who, at some point, had her work rejected. In her account of the emotions she experienced, she likened the feeling of her work's rejection to the loss of a pregnancy.
