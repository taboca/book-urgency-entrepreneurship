## Insights

* Maslow may be suggesting, in "A Theory of Human Motivation," that "Classifications of motivations must be based upon goals rather than upon instigating drives, or motivated behavior." This sounds interesting on one hand but also he might have mentioned in Toward the Psychology of Being that people don't need speficic goals. 

    * Self-esteem regulating "Therefore, we speak simply of fear of knowledge in general without discriminating to sharply fear of the inner from the fear of the outer. In general, this kind of fear is defensive in the sense that it is a protection of our self-esteem, of our love and respect for ourselves. We tend to be afraid of any knowledge that could cause us to despise ourselves or to make us inferior, weak, worthless, evil, shameful. We protect ourselves and our ideal image of ourselves by repression and similar defenses, which are essentially techniques by which we avoid becoming conscious of unpleasant or dangerous truths." p.57 Maslow in Toward the Psychology of Being 

* On the dignosys of denial and enlightement struggle - Grove situation of denial might also be a reflection about transcendence; Which may match the cituation that Marcio had seen with Vanessa. 

* On release and transcending - Leadership deals with the phases, struggle, the paranormal" activities, and more; the subordinates, like specialists, like divisions, may represent the action-driven specialists, not subject to change in the condition of hurrinesst; thus specialists are replaced, thus heads replaced. (AG)

* On sides - The fear for running and fear for holding - Feat. Maslow; Recognize first a fear that is in the language driving to a direction, that exists in micro, daily that asks for effort; and also exists to drive strategy. Feat. Marcio, Feat. Doug Leone. Image of fear that holds - Feat. Maslow (Hubris), Dorothea, Andy Grove (Induced, Autonomous)

* On fear of hubris - or greatness - For the individual level this might have been better reflected; of a fear that is different from that fear of knowing, and the fear of responsibilty (feat. Maslow, Toward the Psychology of Being). The fear of hubris may be a fear of the established system's fear of the chaos which may be applicable to the individuals, or the individual units of a system, willing and interested in growth. When in doubt, about to grow big or to be struck, some of these may be stuck due to an outstanding suggestion by whoever controls a path for the societal system, asking to not access the Gods, to not go too far (this may be a view presented by Maslow). This in the view of Dorothea, could be related, she points the case that professors of writing generally in the very first lecture put upfront that genious cannot be taught, which Dorothea disagree. Her book, becoming a writer, is for that. The fear of Hubris might happen to be the esteem level regulator esteem-level editor? while the fear of knowledge and responsibility acting on other level?

## Article strategic - feat. Barbar's scqa

* abstract - The article discusses the role of fear in the entrepreneurial journey, challenging the perception that fear is always negative but focusing on fear as being a motivator element based on value systems. It highlights how fear can act as a catalyst for holding decisions and may impact creativity and growth. By embracing fear and planning ahead, entrepreneurs can navigate challenges and inspire others. Ultimately, the point is to respect fear, as the premise to be more conscious about how value systems are strong in decision making. 

* subject - Fear can move mountains. We should respect fear. 

* situation - We fear things, it's in our genes. But when we fear, in realtime, there is no agenda for reflecting about why we are fearing. Thus we continue to fear, or to sometimes be fearless, in front of what can happen, as plan our future, like in an entrepreneurial journey. Thus, the role of fear, is strong in the individual level and it makes a point, and it impacts group decision.

* complication - We fail to see that fears in the entrepreneurial setting is a strong factor influencing our decisions. When we fear, we fear based on perceptions, but we might translate fears as structured narratives. Thus, there is no space for "I want to talk about my fears in general" and the narrative goes more like "We will be killed by our competition if we do not engage in competing with them." Thus, the fear can be a driver for construction of narratives, for establishing value systems that can govern decisions. Fear, therefore, needs to be respected as it pushes us to be creative and to make decisions or narratives. 

* qa - Can we get rid of fears? Not really and no need, as fear can be good and can regulate. As we do not want to be fearless, we want to simply reflect and respect fear. We can, however, reflect about situations where fear is connected with a perceived or real identify, and with a group identity, or identity that protects a goal. Identitying that, we can be mindful about fear. 

## Research - Reputational fears 

* Line of reasoning - "While there are many factors at play, the authors’ recent research highlights the role of reputational fears in deterring people from viewing themselves as leaders. Specifically, they found that fears of seeming domineering, different, or unqualified made people in a variety of workplace and academic settings less likely to identify as leaders, in turn making them less likely to take on leadership responsibilities or be seen as leaders by others.

* Related - entrepreneurial self-identity - A research article, Am I an Entrepreneur? Entrepreneurial Self-Identity as an Antecedent of Entrepreneurial Intention , suggests that the perception about oneself might be an element influencing self-identity which has an impact to entrepreneurial intent. "Entrepreneurial intent" is a common term in this article. Accoording to the article, mendola.claudio@gmail.com Claudio is one of the researchers.

## Other - ChatGPT input 

In my book about slowing down for entrepreneurs I have an article so far entitled "Driven by fear" and another "Driven by Love" I wanted with these to invite the reader to reflect about how certain forces push them forward. Such as passion for the job, the matter or how they see themselves effective. And also the role of fear. For example,  regarding fear I have found data from Doug Leone, from Sequoia, that raw fear was a driving force for him. And regarding love, also data from Steve Blank, that entrepreneurs do things becuase they feel it's a calling. 

ChatGPT: It sounds like you have a great start to your book about slowing down for entrepreneurs with the articles "Driven by Fear" and "Driven by Love." These two articles can indeed serve as thought-provoking pieces to encourage readers to reflect on the forces that motivate and guide their entrepreneurial journey. Here's some additional guidance and ideas to develop these articles further:

ChatGPT: 

1. "Driven by Fear":

Explore different aspects of fear that entrepreneurs may experience, such as fear of failure, fear of missing out, fear of competition, or fear of financial instability.
Share more anecdotes and stories from successful entrepreneurs like Doug Leone to illustrate how fear can be a powerful driving force. Discuss the role of fear as a motivator and how it can be channeled positively.
Offer practical advice on managing and harnessing fear constructively. Provide strategies for turning fear into a driving force for growth and innovation.

* Note: value system of identity role influences

## SCqA review 

* Ideas  - We enter trouble such as dead ends. And after post-mortem, we wished we could call us back in time. So while within the frame, we seem to hold ourselves with value systems, but when all fails, then we release control. 

* General subject - The executor, as a person and their role, make decisions and emotions counts, chimes in, especially in front of projections of judges. Our aspirations, and who we think we are make us feel, influences our calls. It's tough to detach. 

* Key - How we experience - Our aspirations, in the beginning, counts more. More value counts, such as motivations and vision & value system. We created value-anchors for who we are and our causes. Then we fail, actually in fact after passing successes, thus we count on prior decisions, such as bets that yielded good advancements supporting our roles.
