@outline - We don't talk, emotions in the corporate.

#### The grown up situation



We want to feel emotions, recognize our fears, and allow ourselves to be vulnerable. If these aren't statements generally observed in the prior situations of individuals or startup teams, even when struggling, not so differently we won't find these reflections in the working situation, of workers getting things done in the setting of grown-up organizations. But the fact that the subject is not brought, not in the workplace, doesn't mean that some of these workers, a lesser extent anyway, aren't bringing these subjects to the room of their therapy sessions or that they arent't anxious because of work, that they aren't free from the their fears, that their well-being as individuals are not impacted by the work setting, and accordinly that the well-being of their organizations aren't being impacted by their lack of consciousness about how these and related themes.  

This situation sets us in the right place to celebrate the courageous who brings these themes and topics and recognize the importance of these topics into the context of grown-up organizations especially when the organization is going through the challenges of reinventing in the face of imminent death and the need to become again. And it's for this reason that we'll be guided by Andy Grove, the late CEO of Intel Corporation, who had the time to bring these reflections and had balanced his own activities to bring this theme and questions which we referred as touchy-feely [^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely] issues and the importance and the path of organizations.

[^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely]: In his book *Only the Paranoid Survive* (1999), Andy Grove discusses, in *Let Chaos Reign*, what he calls *The Touchy-feely Issues*, that in certain situations, particularly those faced by large corporations, managers often react emotionally to crises (p. 123) as business people are humans where their personal growth and emotions are closely tied to the identity and well-being of their business.













If we set our time machine to 1985, and land ourselves in the Ferris wheel of the Great America park in Santa Clara California, we would be able to point our binoculars to Intel's headquarters and witness that special conversation between Andy Grove and Gordon Moore, as documented in *Only The Paranoid Survive*, the conversation that marks a moment of transcendence from Intel management that took them to "The bold decision to commit Intel’s future to microprocessors," [^foonote_hbr_intel_1996] which brought Intel a major transformation to the world, that consumers get that Intel meant the computer's brains: 

[^foonote_hbr_intel_1996]: The article from HBR titled "Inside Intel" by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff (1996), underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of industry crises and technological shifts. In essence, the article considers Intel's journey through significant challenges, including the competitive pressure from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers in the mid-1980 which led to a strategic pivot from memory chips to microprocessors, and how the success from transformation brings new challenges, like a totally new game or sport where the organization has to transcend in order to survive.  

> *"I remember a time in the middle of 1985, after this aimless wandering had been going on for almost a year. I was in my office with Intel's chairman and CEO, Gordon Moore, and we were discussing our quandary. Our mood was downbeat. I looked out the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon and asked, 'If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?' Gordon answered without hesitation, 'He would get us out of memories.' I stared at him, numb, then said, "Why shouldn't you and I walk out the door, come back and do it ourselves?'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 89)

Right there, for me, Andy Grove, had given to us a postcard. An opportunity to see through a window into the process of transformation. This postcard has a view of the present and a viewpoint for the future. And it celebrates the greater thing about America and a certain America's spirit that had amazed he. That all things built, no matter how great they are, can revolve. A spirit that invites anyone to do it, and does not require them to ask for permission. It only interviews the doer, waiting to hear his corageous and honest words, waiting to hear his from his heart that she or he is willing to swim, to hear their energy and courage. That should take them to swim across. 

Let us walk with Andy, through three stations, to follow his lights. First, we will start with the situation of the successful organization that from its right movement enters the valley of death - and the reflection of how we feel when we enter into that path of confusion. Into that ride, we follow the light fro Andy through a reflection that reconciles our drive to continue to be successful and bring right, and how that set us to feel, and fear to challenge our views.

##### Loss and grief 










<!-- 
@outline - The valley of death, according to Andy Grove 
-->

Now before we go on into this ride, we should contextualize the situation where a grown up organization is challenged, as a result of its prior success, to face an adaptation which will likely take them to either grow, or re-invent and commit to the new, or to die and stick with the old. 


> *"But right now, it's a bunch of bits in a confused fashion, and we are just entering the valley of death. It is very confusing in the middle of it. That's not unusual. That is what it's like because the new business model doesn't take shape very clearly. And a lot of people have different ideas on how it's going to be."* (Grove, A., 2019, 16:6)

@outline - context, Intel? 10x and inflection?

This period, Andy refers as Strategic Inflection Points. Andy thought that the theme was applicable to the general audience, which is why his reflection is here in the first place, and because of that [^foonote_andygrove_strategic_inflection_points] he wanted that to be the actual title, instead of *Only the Paranoid Survive* .

[^foonote_andygrove_strategic_inflection_points]: Andy Grove discussed the intended title of his book Only the Paranoid Survive, stating, "I wanted to call this book, Strategic Inflection Points. And it's meant for general purpose audiences, and my publisher wouldn't hear of it. And to make a long story short, it got a catchier title. But that is what the book is about. Strategic inflection point is my way of visualizing and describing a fundamental change in the well-being of a business. Fundamental change in the well-being of an industry" (Grove, 2019).

For Andy, there exists a sequence of emotions that runs through an organization that goes through the said inflection points. These emotions, which can be experienced by people in senior management, aren't too different from those experienced during the loss of loved ones.

> *"A manager in a business that is undergoing a strategic inflection point is likely to experience a variation of the well-known stages of what individuals go through when dealing with a serious loss. This is not surprising because the early stages of a strategic inflection point are fraught with loss. Loss of your company's preeminence in the industry, of its identity, of a sense of control of your company's destiny, of job security and, perhaps the most wrenching, the loss of being affiliated with a winner. However, unlike the accepted model of the sequence of emotions associated with grief, i.e., denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, ultimately, acceptance, in the case of a strategic inflection point, the sequence goes more as follows, denial, escape or diversion and, finally, acceptance and pertinent action."* (Grove, A., 1999)








###### Inertia of success 

Now, for the big or grown up situation there is nothing much different, except the size and some particular characterizations of the hierachical setting that sets them to move slow but with heavy and leaving strong footprints. These grown entities need to go through change too just like their smaller forms. And like any other form they too will be frightened of being wrong. That thought from Sir Ken Robison, that "by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity," applies even more to the corporate beast. It only adds, with success, with the inertia of success [^footnote_andygrove_inertia_of_success].

--> 

[^footnote_andygrove_inertia_of_success]: In business, the concept of "inertia of success" refers to the tendency of successful companies to become complacent and resistant to change, ultimately leading to their downfall. Andy Grove, a former CEO of Intel, famously highlighted this phenomenon, warning that past successes can create a false sense of security, making organizations less agile and adaptable to new challenges and market conditions.





Andy had considered too the connection betweem the situation of challenging for changing, with the very prior steps of success. For him, he referred to it as a phenomenon, "I will call this phenomenon the inertia of success. It is extremely dangerous and it can reinforce denial. "* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125). And went on to celebrate the connection between the inertia of success of the corporate beast with the inertia in ourselves: 

> *"Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to lead with their strengths. So it's not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers, especially during their 'championship season.'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

> *"Business people are not just managers, they are also human. They have emotions and a lot of their emotions are tied up in the identity and well-being of their businesses. If you are a senior manager, you probably got to where you are because you have devoted a large portion of your life to your trade, to your industry and to your company. In many instances, your personal identity is inseparable from your life work. So, when your business gets into serious difficulties, in spite of the best attempts of business schools and management training courses to make you a rational analyzer of data, objective analysis will take second seat to personal and emotional reactions almost every time."* (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 123-124)

##### Diverging phase






To note: We are talking about a senior manager, an educator, a chemical engineer, a reader of manager to name some characterizations of Andy. Clearly telling us that it happens like that, that we become and by becoming we get stuck. And when we get stuck, we defend ourselves. And when we defend, it may appear - although in retrospect - to be movements of a child:  

> *"When the environment changees in such a way as to render the old skills and strenghts less relevant, we almost instinctively cling to our past. We refuse to acknowledge changes around us, almost like a child who doesn't like what he's seeing so he closes his eyes and counts to 100 and figures that what bothered him will go away. We too close our eyes and are willing to work harder, to dedicate ourselves to our traditional tasks or skills, in the hope that they and hard work will get us there by the count of 100. "* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

@outline - protective bubble opportunity missed 
--> 

The struggle, notion of the protective bubble, the conditions, we know it exists somewhere, we have seen it from our life as beings too - the mother that commits, provides the support, let the baby explore and come back. But we know it too when the parent role does not fully commit to the support that is needed. The corporate life of the giant beast, talking care of its little beasty entities, is nothing much different: 

> *"And every general manager is going to jump on me, how can you pull him out of the business that pays all of our salaries? He says, OK, no, no, no, I was kidding. I was kidding. It was a bad idea. Bad idea. Let me take him. And he came up way below him, the other guy in the ranking. Let him do the new business. And he is really not very good. We are only keeping him for tradition's sake. Nothing personal. Then we put him on the new area. And guess what, the new area is not going to succeed. Now, is it not going to succeed because it was a bad idea in the first place? Or is it not going to succeed because we put our second class people on developing it? That's how it goes in real life."* (Grove, 2019, 32:55-33:36).

> *"I have this deep-seated suspicion that the predominant reason people engage in big-time acquisitions is to escape from dealing with a strategic inflection point in their own business - in their own core business. Because nothing is as seductive as teeing up and flying from one place to the other. Staying up all night with your lawyers and your investment bankers and calling a press conference and being on the front page of the newspaper the next day. How does that compare with figuring out which factory to shut down?"* (Grove, A., 2019, 40:22-40:51).


> *"Escape, or diversion, refers to the personal actions of the senior manager. When companies are facing major changes in their core business, they seem to plunge into what seem to be totally unrelated acquisitions and mergers. In my view, a lot of these activities are motivated by the need of senior management to occupy themselves respectively with something that clearly and legitimately requires their attention day in and day out, something that they can justify spending their time on and make progress in instead of figuring out how to cope with an impeding strategic destructive force. At such times, senior managers often involve themselves in feverish, charitable fundraising. A lot of outside board activities are pet projects. Take a look at a representative calendar of the CEO of a major corporation that was in the middle of a strategic inflection point, page 126. Does his allocation of time, his most precious reserves, reflect his strategic crisis? I don't think so."*  (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 124-125)

> *"Escape, or diversion, refers to the personal actions of the senior manager. .. In my view, a lot of these activities are motivated by the need of senior management to occupy themselves respectably with something that clearly and legitimately requires their attention day in and day out, something that they can justify spending their time on and make progress in instead of figuring out how to cope with an impeding, strategic, destructive force."*  (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 124-125)



That is a different kind of photo and reflection to us. To notice how we might show signs when we have a puzzle in front of us. He went on to celebrate that "At such times, senior managers often involve themselves in feverish charitable fundraising, a lot of outside board activities  or pet projects." (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)








One other special observation from Andy have to do with his observation to make a parallel between the writing his book with the challenging situation of Intel. Now, it serves for us here too how his reflection which consited of revisiting his history and reflecting on his prior book writing time served too as a reflection for him later - the moment when he were writing the above book, Only The Paranoid Survive:


> *"Frankly, as I look back, I have to wonder if it was an accident that I devoted a significant amount of my time in the years preceding our memory episode, years during which the storm clouds were already very evident, to writing a book. As I write this, I wonder what storm clouds I might be ducking now. I will probably know in a few years."*  (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

<!--

--> 

Certainly his reflections gave him the means to be asking - wait a minute, am I here again engaging in these activivities of another nature, like writing? From these observations, I think that first and inescapable is the duty the necessity of being thankful to Andy, for getting involved to reflect and to write it, to put it as words, to all of us, and as he shown to give us an enlightening one as he set himself open. It is unescapable the self in the action, the being, in both High Output Management and and Only the Paranoid Survive. Moreover, we shall too observe that Andy's insatisfaction from his "allocation of time, his most precious resource," and the situation of crisis that Intel were going through, were the actual tip for how the situation goes, naturally as while things are happening there is not a sign of the major crisis written in flags and elsewhere. 

Thus, the disconnect given in retrospect is only the invitation for us to celebrate that us to be engaging in the new, in divergent activities, might be the sign of us in front of the unsolvable, the realization that would call for change. It may be even considered, although he didn't write about that, that the very activities of writing served for him as a reflection. 


















##### The fearful or fearless organization being 



Now, 



<!--
@outline - The conscious top-level leadership deals, the action-doer element can indeed be taken by surprise

> *"If you are a middle manager, many of the same considerations apply, but very often your job is also at stake. How your corporation succeeds in working its way through a strategic inflection point may determine what happens to your career."*



What the whole-being business may do, in its urgent fashion, is not to take of very specific entity under it, which may likely mean a fire and replace the beings since they are replaceable and likely they are too involved, as specialists. 


<!-- 

## Research note - Andy on career strategic inflection points 

> *"So enterprises are far more preoccupied with their own survival today than they were a generation ago. And therefore, they are less able physically, less able emotionally and interest-wise, and concentration-wise, less able to deal with the survival of the many little careers, the many little businesses that their employees represent. This subtle favorite cliches of business life today make this problem worse. We love globalization. Globalization means that the world is our oyster. We can sell a product everywhere from here to Jindong. Globalization also means that every person, every working person of the same general training, same general business occupation in the world competes with you. That they work for companies that compete for your company. In a brief period of 30 years, from the '60s to the '90s, the United States in the aggregate has gone from an almost dominant industrial power to one of the leading industrial powers. If you look at that as a market analysis, being a dominant industrial power, a dominant power in your industry versus being one of the contenders back into the Porter model dealing with substitution, dealing with new entrants, dealing with intense intra-industry rivalry, life has gotten a lot tougher for the United States economy. Consequently, life has gotten a lot tougher for companies that make up the United States economy. Consequently, those companies are much less able to. It's not that they became venal, not that they became evil. They're simply less able to provide this style of career development and career maintenance that they used to do it. Now if they don't do it, who's going to do it? And I'm advocating basically doing the same concept of strategic analysis and apply it to your career. And foremost among those is watch for strategic inflection points. Work on separating the signal from the noise. And we complete, conclude that it's signal. Experiment first and then pull in the reins and commit yourself. And discipline yourself to overcome the denial and the various other human foibles that will come in the way in your own career, as well as in your business"* (Grove, 2019, 43:07-46:03).

##### Abstraction or complication



<!-- 
@outline - Mapping out all the situations? 
--> 

A note to consider the comparison between the being right case of the individual and the true of sorrow case of their startup and the valley of death case of Andy Grove. In all the situations we have the phenomenon where the doer, the one that get things done, the entity, the being that get things done is involved in following the market. Here the young writer establishing the critics on top of the potential being, the creative being, the startup by interacting with external environment, seeking approval, struggles with the realities where the outcome producing may not truly satisfy in the struggles of presenting and adapting to the critics, forcing themselves in the block situation and in similar ways the case of Andy Grove of a major corporation going through the valley of death is essentially about what Andy Grove referred as a corporation that achieved a degree of success or what he calls the inertia of success and then the inflection point required because of the 10x force which might be a new configuration to the environment given by the new setting of the competitive forces. In other words, a movement, a prior movement given by competitive forces is insufficient given that the audience demands are reconfigured. It is the attempt to control success and how we regulate that control that tells what's going to happen essentially.


It may not be so far anyway from the trough of sorrow brought before, that situation of a startup essentially talking with the market, projecting its offering, being excited and then realizing the need to commit to a sort of doing again. But while that valley involves a story in the early stage, this valley of death is the equivalent the huge entity - like Intel - which happens to be already living its maturity, had lived from its prior successes, which essentially goes well with the proper possibility as an output - potential death.
