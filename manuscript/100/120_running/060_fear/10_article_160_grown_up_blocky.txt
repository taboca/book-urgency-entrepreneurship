#### The grown up situation




We want to feel emotions, we want to recognize fear, we want to allow ourselves to be vulnerable. These aren't  statements that we generally get busy with, or even think of, especially in the entrepreneurial or the corporate work setting. It sounds as things for a therapy session. But the fact that the work setting doesn't give us the space for this reflection doesn't mean that we're not impacted by emotions, and that these aren't impacting the future of our organizations, and with that too of ourselves as beings. We know too, that somewhere it is in there, it's just hidden, this connection, exactly shaded from the reflections not taking place.

It takes a great human and a great deal of courage for a leader to recognize, to bring any subject closer to that, especially in the context of grown up organizations. For the one that reflects, and furthermore that speaks about these touchy-feely [^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely] issues, right there struggles. Because it's not a movement toward success as it is seen. Because it sounds like going back to the beginning and then it is certainly unavoidable as a theme justifying the avoidable. As focusing in the courageous matters more, it is the case of Andy Grove, the late CEO of Intel Corporation, that had in fact considered this theme, actually from doing it. In other words, part of this struggle had to do with balancing his activities to reflect on what was going on when Intel were grown up but were faced with the opportunity to become, again, as oppose to be defensive, and die. 

Andy set himself into the reflection which involved aspects of the said touchy-feely issues. He had entered the reflective space to reconcile the dynamics of emotional humans, senior management, and how they were affected by the prior success of their work and of their organization, and how that setting had set their own fate in the face of the needed to change and to adapt. 

[^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely]: In his book *Only the Paranoid Survive* (1999), Andy Grove discusses, in *Let Chaos Reign*, what he calls *The Touchy-feely Issues*, that in certain situations, particularly those faced by large corporations, managers often react emotionally to crises (p. 123) as business people are humans where their personal growth and emotions are closely tied to the identity and well-being of their business.

@outline - context, Intel? 10x and inflection?

Now before we go on into this ride, we should contextualize the situation where a grown up organization is challenged, as a result of its prior success, to face an adaptation which will likely take them to either grow, or re-invent and commit to the new, or to die and stick with the old. This period, Andy refers as Strategic Inflection Points. Andy thought that the theme was applicable to the general audience, which is why his reflection is here in the first place, and because of that [^foonote_andygrove_strategic_inflection_points] he wanted that to be the actual title, instead of *Only the Paranoid Survive* .

[^foonote_andygrove_strategic_inflection_points]: Andy Grove discussed the intended title of his book Only the Paranoid Survive, stating, "I wanted to call this book, Strategic Inflection Points. And it's meant for general purpose audiences, and my publisher wouldn't hear of it. And to make a long story short, it got a catchier title. But that is what the book is about. Strategic inflection point is my way of visualizing and describing a fundamental change in the well-being of a business. Fundamental change in the well-being of an industry" (Grove, 2019).

@outline - Passage 
--> 


If we set our time machine to 1985, and land ourselves in the Ferris wheel of the Great America park in Santa Clara California, we would be able to point our binoculars to Intel's headquarters and witness that special conversation between Andy Grove and Gordon Moore, as documented in *Only The Paranoid Survive*, the conversation that marks a moment of transcendence from Intel management that took them to "The bold decision to commit Intel’s future to microprocessors," [^foonote_hbr_intel_1996] which brought Intel a major transformation to the world, that consumers get that Intel meant the computer's brains: 

[^foonote_hbr_intel_1996]: The article from HBR titled "Inside Intel" by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff (1996), underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of industry crises and technological shifts. In essence, the article considers Intel's journey through significant challenges, including the competitive pressure from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers in the mid-1980 which led to a strategic pivot from memory chips to microprocessors, and how the success from transformation brings new challenges, like a totally new game or sport where the organization has to transcend in order to survive.  

> *"I remember a time in the middle of 1985, after this aimless wandering had been going on for almost a year. I was in my office with Intel's chairman and CEO, Gordon Moore, and we were discussing our quandary. Our mood was downbeat. I looked out the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon and asked, 'If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?' Gordon answered without hesitation, 'He would get us out of memories.' I stared at him, numb, then said, "Why shouldn't you and I walk out the door, come back and do it ourselves?'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 89)

Now if that moment had gained that picture; it is the picture of invitation that recognizes the roles of the being into the major problem and how the marutity that we achive, especially in the situations of the major ship, become acting forces on us. We flip this postal and it would like Andy is asking us - keep here with me, let us talk about a lot else that happens with us, and the subtitle things that we may not even note if we are not aware. This invitation holds three themes. 

One is the consideration of emotions and the state of grief, in the face of change, which involves loss, associated from the success. 

The other is our reaction, as we fear, or as the organization set us into a movement, and our natural tendency to defend and fear knowing, and which involves diversion. 

And then we shall conclude with observations of effects in the aggregated organization and stages of allowance.

##### Loss and grief 

For Andy, there exists a sequence of emotions that runs through an organization that goes through the said inflection points. These emotions, which can be experienced by people in senior management, aren't too different from those experienced during the loss of loved ones.

> *"A manager in a business that is undergoing a strategic inflection point is likely to experience a variation of the well-known stages of what individuals go through when dealing with a serious loss. This is not surprising because the early stages of a strategic inflection point are fraught with loss. Loss of your company's preeminence in the industry, of its identity, of a sense of control of your company's destiny, of job security and, perhaps the most wrenching, the loss of being affiliated with a winner. However, unlike the accepted model of the sequence of emotions associated with grief, i.e., denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, ultimately, acceptance, in the case of a strategic inflection point, the sequence goes more as follows, denial, escape or diversion and, finally, acceptance and pertinent action."* 



Let us first bring about his definition of an inflection point in the context of a major organization. According to Andy, Intel went through a few of those but likely the most iconic passage were when Intel had to drop its identity from *being* a memory chip manufacturer, and went to the the struggle, to embrace *becoming*, a microprocessor manufacturer. Since Intel survived that inflection point, Intel became known as the largest manufacturer of microprocessors, and then too so many managers got to know the so manygood thoughts from Andy. The following passage gives us a view: 

> *""* 

But then, as the major corporation is passing through that, is perhaps a reflection of what a human passes as they need to move from being and into becoming especially when they are challenged, their views, their perspectives, their views about their identities. 

He suggests a parallel between the sequence of losing a loved one and the sequence experienced in the corporate domain during an inflection point. Grove revealed that he wrote one of his books amidst one of these turbulent journeys that Intel went through around the 1980s suggesting that in that situation, he might have been escaping from recognizing the situation? Perhaps?


###### Inertia of success 

Now, for the big or grown up situation there is nothing much different, except the size and some particular characterizations of the hierachical setting that sets them to move slow but with heavy and leaving strong footprints. These grown entities need to go through change too just like their smaller forms. And like any other form they too will be frightened of being wrong. That thought from Sir Ken Robison, that "by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity," applies even more to the corporate beast. It only adds, with success, with the inertia of success [^footnote_andygrove_inertia_of_success].

[^footnote_andygrove_inertia_of_success]: In business, the concept of "inertia of success" refers to the tendency of successful companies to become complacent and resistant to change, ultimately leading to their downfall. Andy Grove, a former CEO of Intel, famously highlighted this phenomenon, warning that past successes can create a false sense of security, making organizations less agile and adaptable to new challenges and market conditions.

###### Business people are managers 


> *"Business people are not just managers, they are also human. They have emotions and a lot of their emotions are tied up in the identity and well-being of their businesses. If you are a senior manager, you probably got to where you are because you have devoted a large portion of your life to your trade, to your industry and to your company. In many instances, your personal identity is inseparable from your life work. So, when your business gets into serious difficulties, in spite of the best attempts of business schools and management training courses to make you a rational analyzer of data, objective analysis will take second seat to personal and emotional reactions almost every time."* (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 123-124)

##### Diverging phase

> *"He is by no means unique, frankly, as I look back, I have to wonder if it was an accident that I've devoted a significant amount of my time in the years preceding our memory episode, years during which the storm clouds were already very evident to writing a book. As I write this, I wonder what storm clouds I might be ducking now, I'll probably know in a few years."* 



> *"Escape, or diversion, refers to the personal actions of the senior manager. When companies are facing major changes in their car business, they seem to plunge into what seem to be totally unrelated acquisitions and mergers. In my view, a lot of these activities are motivated by the need of senior management to occupy themselves respectively with something that clearly and legitimately requires their attention day in and day out, something that they can justify spending their time on and make progress in instead of figuring out how to cope with an impeding strategic destructive force. At such times, senior managers often involve themselves in feverish, charitable fundraising. A lot of outside board activities are pet projects. Take a look at a representative calendar of the CEO of a major corporation that was in the middle of a strategic inflection point, page 126. Does his allocation of time, his most precious reserves, reflect his strategic crisis? I don't think so."* 







 One aspect to consider is what Andy had notice - our willingness to escape: 

> *"Escape, or diversion, refers to the personal actions of the senior manager. .. In my view, a lot of these activities are motivated by the need of senior management to occupy themselves respectably with something that clearly and legitimately requires their attention day in and day out, something that they can justify spending their time on and make progress in instead of figuring out how to cope with an impeding, strategic, destructive force."*  (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 124-125)

That is a different kind of photo and reflection to us. To notice how we might show signs when we have a puzzle in front of us. He went on to celebrate that "At such times, senior managers often involve themselves in feverish charitable fundraising, a lot of outside board activities  or pet projects." (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

One other special observation from Andy have to do with his observation to make a parallel between the writing his book with the challenging situation of Intel. Now, it serves for us here too how his reflection which consited of revisiting his history and reflecting on his prior book writing time served too as a reflection for him later - the moment when he were writing the above book, Only The Paranoid Survive:

> *"Frankly, as I look back, I have to wonder if it was an accident that I devoted a significant amount of my time in the years preceding our memory episode, years during which the storm clouds were already very evident, to writing a book. As I write this, I wonder what storm clouds I might be ducking now. I will probably know in a few years."*  (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

--> 

Certainly his reflections gave him the means to be asking - wait a minute, am I here again engaging in these activivities of another nature, like writing? From these observations, I think that first and inescapable is the duty the necessity of being thankful to Andy, for getting involved to reflect and to write it, to put it as words, to all of us, and as he shown to give us an enlightening one as he set himself open. It is unescapable the self in the action, the being, in both High Output Management and and Only the Paranoid Survive. Moreover, we shall too observe that Andy's insatisfaction from his "allocation of time, his most precious resource," and the situation of crisis that Intel were going through, were the actual tip for how the situation goes, naturally as while things are happening there is not a sign of the major crisis written in flags and elsewhere. 

Thus, the disconnect given in retrospect is only the invitation for us to celebrate that us to be engaging in the new, in divergent activities, might be the sign of us in front of the unsolvable, the realization that would call for change. It may be even considered, although he didn't write about that, that the very activities of writing served for him as a reflection. 


Andy had considered too the connection betweem the situation of challenging for changing, with the very prior steps of success. For him, he referred to it as a phenomenon, "I will call this phenomenon the inertia of success. It is extremely dangerous and it can reinforce denial. "* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125). ANd went on to give us enough information to celebrate that our movement towards growing also shapes maturity and inertia in us, and how that may well add to the challenging situations for us to change ourselves: 

> *"Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to lead with their strengths. So it's not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers, especially during their 'championship season.'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

To note: We are talking about a senior manager, an educator, a chemical engineer, a reader of manager to name some characterizations of Andy. Clearly telling us that it happens like that, that we become and by becoming we get stuck. And when we get stuck, we defend ourselves. And when we defend, it may appear - although in retrospect - to be movements of a child:  

> *"When the environment changees in such a way as to render the old skills and strenghts less relevant, we almost instinctively cling to our past. We refuse to acknowledge changes around us, almost like a child who doesn't like what he's seeing so he closes his eyes and counts to 100 and figures that what bothered him will go away. We too close our eyes and are willing to work harder, to dedicate ourselves to our traditional tasks or skills, in the hope that they and hard work will get us there by the count of 100. "* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)
