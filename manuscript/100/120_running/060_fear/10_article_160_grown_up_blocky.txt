@outline - We don't talk, emotions in the corporate. 



-->

#### The full-blown procrastinator



We need to talk about our feelings, about our fears. We need to allow ourselves to be vulnerable. If these aren't thoughts in our minds in the start, it is only a matter of consequence that our grown up organizations ignore these little things. But deep inside we feel it, although not as hard as some of us doing therapy sessions, that our fears and anxieties set a course to our well-being and the well-being of our organizations in synergistic ways. 

Now if an act of courage opens up to these soft issues - as the corporation puts it sometimes - he or she will be seen as weak. And if she insist, perhaps a paranoid. This may be so especially given that leaders are expected to be strong, brave, consistent, therefore not fearful or confused. But Andy Grove, the late CEO of Intel, didn't fear to bring about and to refer these softer things as *Touchy-feely Issues* [^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely], and to moreover show to us how these issues are real, and how hard they can affect our well-being and the well-being of our organizations, especially in a particular situation when the future of a successful business is challenged, what he called the *The Valley of Death*. I will let Andy take our time machine back to 1985 so we can take a look of how things go in reality:  

[^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely]: In his book *Only the Paranoid Survive* (1999), Andy Grove discusses, in *Let Chaos Reign*, what he calls *The Touchy-feely Issues*, that in certain situations, particularly those faced by large corporations, managers often react emotionally to crises (p. 123) as business people are humans where their personal growth and emotions are closely tied to the identity and well-being of their business.

> *"I remember a time in the middle of 1985, after this aimless wandering had been going on for almost a year. I was in my office with Intel’s chairman and CEO, Gordon Moore, and we were discussing our quandary. Our mood was downbeat. I looked out the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon and asked, ‘If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?’ Gordon answered without hesitation, ‘He would get us out of memories.’ I stared at him, numb, then said, “Why shouldn’t you and I walk out the door, come back and do it ourselves?’" (Grove, A., 1999, p. 89)

That iconic conversation would be a great final scene for a 2-hour movie based in a true story. Their view, the Ferris wheel of Great America, and their final words. Then a fade out and fade in. And next to the scrolling credits, a sequence of events: These leaders undertook the "bold decision to commit Intel’s future to microprocessors[^foonote_hbr_intel_1996]." In October 1985, Intel decided to shut down their memory manufacturing operations. That bold decision took Intel to rise as the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessors and lead the personal computer revolution. Intel had enabled complementors to innovate, such as Microsoft Windows. Intel's leadership had open up new chapters to the history of Silicon Valley, the rise of browsers, the rise of smartphones, and the rest is history. This movie is dedicated to the memory of Andy Grove. 

[^foonote_hbr_intel_1996]: The article from HBR titled "Inside Intel" by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff (1996), underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of industry crises and technological shifts. In essence, the article considers Intel's journey through significant challenges, including the competitive pressure from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers in the mid-1980 which led to a strategic pivot from memory chips to microprocessors, and how the success from transformation brings new challenges, like a totally new game or sport where the organization has to transcend in order to survive.  

But if Andy were here, he would say, "Stop! Wait, that doesn't look like how things happen in real life." And while I would be tempted to tell him that in real life people should read his books; yet, we are here anyway and this is a book moment. So let us accept Andy's invitation and look through a window into a process - what goes on with us when things are hard, when the environment changes, when our future is uncertain. Right there, next to Gordon, he had reminded them, and us, that the laws of engineers (with all the hard work and precision) need to be reconciled with the laws of humans (with all the softness). That no matter the size of the organization, and the number of specialists around, there are those hard and chaotic moments when our emotions will reign. So let us enter into that *Valley of Death*, one with no signs of warning, a muddy field and a long walk where we are following a certain light that is too far and never closer, where we fear if the light is from the lanterns of the enermy or are the lights of safe port.

@outline - The valley of death, according to Andy Grove 
@outline - context, Intel? 10x and inflection?
-->



The particular situation which he called the *The Valley of Death* is applicable for general audiences. And that is the same for his book *Only the Paranoid Survive*. But Andy wanted the book title to be *Strategic Inflection Points* [^foonote_andygrove_strategic_inflection_points] because it helps him to picture a curve: A curvature that starts convex but shifts and becomes concave - or goes from concave to convex. This is his way to describe a fundamental change in the well-being of a business. One not driven by internal changes, but by external forces like the forces of competition and/or industry forces. To illustrate how the forces change, Andy referred to it as an 10x force [^footnote_andy_10x]. 

[^footnote_andy_10x]: In *Strategic Inflection Points* (2019 MIT Video Productions, 8:35), Andy illustrates the 10x force, referring to the period when the personal computer's cost-effectiveness dramatically reshaped the computer industry.

@note
* Note - quote - "Computers were sold as vertically integrated devices, proprietary platforms, proprietary operating systems, applications developed for that proprietary operating system, and a whole stack of things sold by salesforce that was unique to that enterprise. [ ... ] Then came the personal computer, which was in fact a genuine almost quantitatively correctly describable 10x force in that its cost effectiveness relative to mainframes or mini computers was about 10-fold right from the inception on. And it was clearly a toy. And it was clearly unreliable. And it couldn't do the software that was pertinent to business processes. But it was so cost effective that it represented a 10x force. And in front of our eyes in the course of the decade of the '80s, the entire structure of the industry changed from the vertical towers of computer products competing with each other to a completely horizontal industry in which microprocessors compete with other microprocessors, operating systems compete with other operating systems, applications software in a packet form like a bunch of commodity goods, like a bunch of detergents, compete for deck shelf space with other application software. And direct sales goes out as a means of distribution. Distribution becomes all indirect." Andy Grove (2019 MIT Video Productions, 8:35)

But the point of the whole inflection point, which depends on the assumption that everything changes and where the nature of the business changes in profound ways, is the stage for how things go in real life. In other words, he is inviting us to zoom in, into that moment where things are gray and difficult to know what is going on. That happens because what is going on, from the inside and in the present, is subtle. There are no signs, as for which way to go, because there are no signs of what is going on: 

> *"But right now, it's a bunch of bits in a confused fashion, and we are just entering the valley of death. It is very confusing in the middle of it. That's not unusual. That is what it's like because the new business model doesn't take shape very clearly. And a lot of people have different ideas on how it's going to be."* (Grove, A., 2019, 16:6)

[^foonote_andygrove_strategic_inflection_points]: Andy Grove discussed the intended title of his book Only the Paranoid Survive, stating, "I wanted to call this book, Strategic Inflection Points. And it's meant for general purpose audiences, and my publisher wouldn't hear of it. And to make a long story short, it got a catchier title. But that is what the book is about. Strategic inflection point is my way of visualizing and describing a fundamental change in the well-being of a business. Fundamental change in the well-being of an industry" (Grove, 2019).

For Andy, there exists a sequence of emotions that runs through an organization that goes through the said inflection points. These emotions, which can be experienced by people in senior management, aren't too different from those experienced during the loss of loved ones: 

> *"A manager in a business that is undergoing a strategic inflection point is likely to experience a variation of the well-known stages of what individuals go through when dealing with a serious loss. This is not surprising because the early stages of a strategic inflection point are fraught with loss. Loss of your company's preeminence in the industry, of its identity, of a sense of control of your company's destiny, of job security and, perhaps the most wrenching, the loss of being affiliated with a winner. However, unlike the accepted model of the sequence of emotions associated with grief, i.e., denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, ultimately, acceptance, in the case of a strategic inflection point, the sequence goes more as follows, denial, escape or diversion and, finally, acceptance and pertinent action."* (Grove, A., 1999)

Of course, all of that is only possible if we are really attached to things. This is the same in the life of a being that loves something or the successful situation of a business organization. All the bodies that did an outstanding job, to bring about a healthy well-being organization, will inevitably be attached to their success. In other words, all that comes next comes from our inertia of success[^footnote_andygrove_inertia_of_success]:

[^footnote_andygrove_inertia_of_success]: In business, the concept of "inertia of success" refers to the tendency of successful companies to become complacent and resistant to change, ultimately leading to their downfall. Andy Grove, a former CEO of Intel, famously highlighted this phenomenon, warning that past successes can create a false sense of security, making organizations less agile and adaptable to new challenges and market conditions.

> *"Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to lead with their strengths. So it's not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers, especially during their 'championship season.'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

Now what comes from the championship season in the context of cooperation certainly looks different from the love season with our relationships and loved ones. Therefore, the effects as we go through the stage of loss in the corporate situation, that professional environment, deserve some observations. Nevertheless, according to Andy, can be comparable to the experiences where we essentially escape or deny what is going on. As an example, we may consider his point about acquisitions:

> *"I have this deep-seated suspicion that the predominant reason people engage in big-time acquisitions is to escape from dealing with a strategic inflection point in their own business - in their own core business. Because nothing is as seductive as teeing up and flying from one place to the other. Staying up all night with your lawyers and your investment bankers and calling a press conference and being on the front page of the newspaper the next day. How does that compare with figuring out which factory to shut down?"* (Grove, A., 2019, 40:22-40:51).

-->

Another observation from *Only the Paranoid Survive* involves the actual print of a daily calendar (Grove, A., 1999, p. 126) of a senior executive going through that period, where Andy had identified an involvement with charitable fundraising and other pet projects, essentially to occupy themselves. He then wonders, "Does his allocation of time, his most precious reserves, reflect his strategic crisis? I don't think so."*  (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 124-125)


his analysis in retrospect is a celebration of the movement of denial and escapism sadly one that in reality appears as productive movements. One other special observation from Andy celebrates or wonders about his own movement as a writer. Were he essentially escaping when he were writing *High Output Management* and *Only the Paranoid Survive*?

> *"Frankly, as I look back, I have to wonder if it was an accident that I devoted a significant amount of my time in the years preceding our memory episode, years during which the storm clouds were already very evident, to writing a book. As I write this, I wonder what storm clouds I might be ducking now. I will probably know in a few years."*  (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

Certainly he is right and he were escaping to a place. But we too shall celebrate the conditions that enabled his reflective experience which took him to enter that honest place, when we are able to enter the reflection and not fear knowing.

@outline - protective bubble opportunity missed

In this context, if the being is able to enter a honest reflection them the general setting that they are should be considered, in terms of the supporting conditions. That was also the case of Intel when Andy were going through these days. In the paper *Let Chaos Reign, Then Rein In Chaos* (2007), Andy joined professor Robert Burgelman and considered that two processes must be present in growing organizations - induced and autonomous. The induced is the one that expects and where prior know-how tells what to do. I like to think of it as a tops-down direction as in following a plan given a perspective known. While the autonomous could be the bottoms-up direction, where control has to be released and autonomy is given, which certainly accepts the creative movement. The expected well-being, as they highlight, consists in being able to, after having achieved success or the conditions, to balance between these: 

> *"Alert strategic leadership is cognizant of the important role of both induced and autonomous processes in strategy-making, tolerates a sufficient level of uncommitted resources and looseness in control to continue to maintain a portfolio of autonomous initiatives, and is able to select at the right time those that need to be converted to the discipline of the induced process in order to cope with nonlinear strategic dynamics"* (Burgelman & Grove, 2007).

Now from that expectation, a level of alertness or consciousness or an ability to balance out activities, certainly requires the conditions. Here we should acknowledge, and recount from the history of Intel, that they had acquired enough reserves which allowed them to move away from their memory business in front of the 10x force from Japan introducing and competing by offering cheaper memories. In other words, it was through the prior rise, as the world's leader manufacturer of memories, that Intel had created some other conditions, or prepared themselves. Of the various supporting conditions that Intel had acquired, one had to do with Intel's future since the microprocessor division existed and they even had a good microprocessor product by 1985. In other words, when Intel had decided to commit, it wasn't an arbitrary movement. This situation is not different from the conditions that a mother creates for her baby to go about discovering the world (a little space in the beginning) which we may celebrate from Maslow's observations: 

> *"But we know also that curiosity and exploration are 'higher' needs than safety, which is just to say that the need to feel safe, secure, unanxious, unafraid is prepotent, stronger over curiosity. Both in monkeys and in human children this can be openly observed. The young child in a strange environment will characteristically hang on to its mother and only then, venture out little by little from her lap to probe into things, to explore and to probe. If she disappears and he becomes frightened, the curiosity disappears until safety is restored. He explores only out of a safe harbour."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.61)

Now, given the celebration of these conditions, yet that does not mean that there is a sign that the valley of death has passed. That is why Andy, next to Gordon and the Ferris Wheel, referred to the conversation as a quandary and their mood as downbeat. The complexity is that, in reality, the mother wants to let the baby go. But on the other hand, she wants to keep the baby safe. 

As for the corporate situation, In *Strategic Inflection Points*, Andy had illustrated how it in real life, when the decision is made and the the company has commited. That is when the leader says that "I'm going go to my best guy here." And he does, and tells the guy, "OK, you're going to go on this emerging stuff." But then, and as a result, every general manager jumps on him and ask "How can you pull him out of the business that pays all of our salaries?" So then the leader says "OK, no, no, no, I was kidding. I was kidding. It was a bad idea. Bad idea." Now they go on and replace that guy, so they pick the other guy bellow him. And now, guess what, that "new area is not going to succeed" and Andy wonders "Is it not going to succeed because it was a bad idea in the first place? Or is it not going to succeed because we put our second class people on developing it? That's how it goes in real life."  (Grove, 2019, 32:55-33:36)

And this is not different from the individual situation and circumstances of life when we choose good things to do, as in honorable things, and set ourselves in a course which we believe is not causing harm to something greater (like dreams) and in fact might be about a compromise. In *Wake Up and Live*, Dorothea Brande considers that we may do a bargain: 

> *"If we manage to be fairly comfortable, to get some respect and admiration, a taste of 'a little brief authority,' and some love, we think we have made a good bargain, we acquiesce in the will to fail. We even pride ourselves on our shrewdness, not suspecting how badly we have been cheated, that we have settled for the compensations of death, not the rewards of life."* (Brande, Dorothea., 2014, p. 21)

*The Will to Fail* is how she describes when we enter into a path of failure by accepting failure. This is when we, as the mothers of ourselves, commit our best resources, energy, creativity, our willpower. She remind us of how far we can go, how busy we can get into these affairs, of denial or escapism or bargaining. Once we route ourselves from a greater thing, we won't know, just like the situation given by Andy. I am not going to succeed because it is the wrong area in the first place? Or I am not going to succeed because I have used my second-class being doing it? I conclude, like Andy, that is how it goes in real life.
