#### Growing up to procrastinate



We need to talk about our feelings, allow ourselves to be vulnerable, and talk about our fears. If these aren't thoughts in the way of entrepreneurs - even when they struggle - it is not surprising that we maintaining that position when we are inside grown up organizations. But deep inside they know it - although not as conscious as the few of us the therapy room - that deep inside we struggle, as individuals, and the well-being of our organizations struggles. If our educated selves, and our teams, struggles from being frightened of being wrong, our grown up organizations are mere sum of our fears, generally commited as runners.  

Now if courage is required for anyone to even offer advice for individuals doing it or the startup situation, even more daring if The situation sets us in the right place to wonder if there are any courageous leaders who recognize the importance of these topics, the applicability of what could be considered touchy-feely [^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely] issues in the context of management of grown-up organizations. One in particular is the outstanding Andy Grove, the late CEO of Intel, who witnessed and supported Intel throught what he called the Valley of Death, the particular circunstance that requires managent to access a level of honesty that breaks into the roots of human beings. 

[^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely]: In his book *Only the Paranoid Survive* (1999), Andy Grove discusses, in *Let Chaos Reign*, what he calls *The Touchy-feely Issues*, that in certain situations, particularly those faced by large corporations, managers often react emotionally to crises (p. 123) as business people are humans where their personal growth and emotions are closely tied to the identity and well-being of their business.




If we set our time machine to 1985, and land ourselves in the Ferris wheel of the Great America park in Santa Clara California, and set our binoculars to Intel's headquarters, we would be able to see a special conversation between Andy Grove and Gordon Moore. Intel was going through what Andy called the Valley of Death and Gordon were the CEO. In short, they were in front of a gray ocean, on the side known to them. They could stay there, in the land where they were known as the captains of the largest producer of computer memory chips:  

[^foonote_hbr_intel_1996]: The article from HBR titled "Inside Intel" by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff (1996), underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of industry crises and technological shifts. In essence, the article considers Intel's journey through significant challenges, including the competitive pressure from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers in the mid-1980 which led to a strategic pivot from memory chips to microprocessors, and how the success from transformation brings new challenges, like a totally new game or sport where the organization has to transcend in order to survive.  

> *"I remember a time in the middle of 1985, after this aimless wandering had been going on for almost a year. I was in my office with Intel's chairman and CEO, Gordon Moore, and we were discussing our quandary. Our mood was downbeat. I looked out the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon and asked, 'If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?' Gordon answered without hesitation, 'He would get us out of memories.' I stared at him, numb, then said, "Why shouldn't you and I walk out the door, come back and do it ourselves?'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 89)

We may think, perhaps if reading too fast, of that as an eloquent narrative that goes well with the long and complex discussions happening before these managers undertook "The bold decision to commit Intel’s future to microprocessors," [^foonote_hbr_intel_1996] which brought Intel to the other side, to become the largest manufacturer of computer processors. But for me, Andy is giving us an opportunity to see through a window into the process. This postcard has a view of the present and a viewpoint for the future. And it celebrates the greater thing about America and a certain America's spirit that had amazed he. That all things built, no matter how great they are, can revolve. A spirit that invites anyone to do it, and does not require them to ask for permission. It only interviews the doer, waiting to hear his corageous and honest words, waiting to hear his from his heart that she or he is willing to swim, to hear their energy and courage. That should take them to swim across. To even talk in that way, to be open to do it that way, and to bring about these touchy-feely issues before management, that is Andy Grove remembering us that hard work goes along with being honest. 

Let us ride with Andy through a few stations. First, we will start from a departure of a full-blownorganization that grows successfully and it is bold and strong but out of the blue enters what he referred to as the *The Valley of Death*. From that darker space, we will follow a light from Andy that reconciles how our successful beings, our organizations and individual identities built from our prior successes, struggles just like any human being struggle in the face of growth towards what is unknown.

##### Death in the air

@outline - The valley of death, according to Andy Grove 
@outline - context, Intel? 10x and inflection?

The particular situation of the *The Valley of Death* is applicable for general audiences. But Andy wanted his book, *Only the Paranoid Survive*, to be called *Strategic Inflection Points* [^foonote_andygrove_strategic_inflection_points], because it helps him to picture a curve, one where a curvature that is convex shifts and becomes concave - or goes from concave to convex. This is his "way of visualizing and describing a fundamental change in the well-being of a business." From far, and in retrospect, we can easy visualize how a nature of a business change in "profound ways." But his inviting us to actually zoom in, into that inflection moment, into that reflection, about how gray things can be and how difficult it is to know what is going on even to a point that the one that does see might be seen as a paranoid. That happens because what is going on appears from the inside in subtle ways. There are no signs as for which way to go because there are not a clear setting of a decision that has to be made. And since the inflection point is not generally perceived, right there we celebrate Andy's point about the subtitle signs: 

> *"But right now, it's a bunch of bits in a confused fashion, and we are just entering the valley of death. It is very confusing in the middle of it. That's not unusual. That is what it's like because the new business model doesn't take shape very clearly. And a lot of people have different ideas on how it's going to be."* (Grove, A., 2019, 16:6)

[^foonote_andygrove_strategic_inflection_points]: Andy Grove discussed the intended title of his book Only the Paranoid Survive, stating, "I wanted to call this book, Strategic Inflection Points. And it's meant for general purpose audiences, and my publisher wouldn't hear of it. And to make a long story short, it got a catchier title. But that is what the book is about. Strategic inflection point is my way of visualizing and describing a fundamental change in the well-being of a business. Fundamental change in the well-being of an industry" (Grove, 2019).

For Andy, there exists a sequence of emotions that runs through an organization that goes through the said inflection points. These emotions, which can be experienced by people in senior management, aren't too different from those experienced during the loss of loved ones: 

> *"A manager in a business that is undergoing a strategic inflection point is likely to experience a variation of the well-known stages of what individuals go through when dealing with a serious loss. This is not surprising because the early stages of a strategic inflection point are fraught with loss. Loss of your company's preeminence in the industry, of its identity, of a sense of control of your company's destiny, of job security and, perhaps the most wrenching, the loss of being affiliated with a winner. However, unlike the accepted model of the sequence of emotions associated with grief, i.e., denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, ultimately, acceptance, in the case of a strategic inflection point, the sequence goes more as follows, denial, escape or diversion and, finally, acceptance and pertinent action."* (Grove, A., 1999)

Of course, all of that is only possible if we are attached to things. This is the same in the life of a being that loves something or the successful situation of a corporation. All the bodies that did an outstanding job to bring about a healthy division, will inevitably be attached to the situation. In other words, what sets in being into a valley of death is simply put a result from the inertia of success[^footnote_andygrove_inertia_of_success]:

[^footnote_andygrove_inertia_of_success]: In business, the concept of "inertia of success" refers to the tendency of successful companies to become complacent and resistant to change, ultimately leading to their downfall. Andy Grove, a former CEO of Intel, famously highlighted this phenomenon, warning that past successes can create a false sense of security, making organizations less agile and adaptable to new challenges and market conditions.

> *"Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to lead with their strengths. So it's not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers, especially during their 'championship season.'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

For me it is inescapable to think of the adult form, or the educated ones, which we have considered from Sir Ken Robison, the notion that "by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity." That too, the not unlike us beings, our corporate beast or being, will grow its own educated form, from its prior sucesses, and will set themselves into being frightened of being wrong:

> *"Business people are not just managers, they are also human. They have emotions and a lot of their emotions are tied up in the identity and well-being of their businesses. If you are a senior manager, you probably got to where you are because you have devoted a large portion of your life to your trade, to your industry and to your company. In many instances, your personal identity is inseparable from your life work. So, when your business gets into serious difficulties, in spite of the best attempts of business schools and management training courses to make you a rational analyzer of data, objective analysis will take second seat to personal and emotional reactions almost every time."* (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 123-124)

##### Escaping with a bargain 





Now what follows from that being from a championship season now passing through the stages of loss, deserves special attention exactly because of the professional reactions that may not take us to see clearly how critical is the situation which reinforces denial. Andy had identitied some possibilities of a reactive movement from the corporate stage. One is acquisitions: 

> *"I have this deep-seated suspicion that the predominant reason people engage in big-time acquisitions is to escape from dealing with a strategic inflection point in their own business - in their own core business. Because nothing is as seductive as teeing up and flying from one place to the other. Staying up all night with your lawyers and your investment bankers and calling a press conference and being on the front page of the newspaper the next day. How does that compare with figuring out which factory to shut down?"* (Grove, A., 2019, 40:22-40:51).

-->

He went on, observing, honestly, how it may happen, when the agenda of the senior executive changes, out of the blue if we could fast-foward as a movie:  

> *"In my view, a lot of these activities are motivated by the need of senior management to occupy themselves respectively with something that clearly and legitimately requires their attention day in and day out, something that they can justify spending their time on and make progress in instead of figuring out how to cope with an impeding strategic destructive force. At such times, senior managers often involve themselves in feverish, charitable fundraising. A lot of outside board activities are pet projects. Take a look at a representative calendar of the CEO of a major corporation that was in the middle of a strategic inflection point, page 126. Does his allocation of time, his most precious reserves, reflect his strategic crisis? I don't think so."*  (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 124-125)


That is Andy celebrating the aspects of denial and escapism, acting in various ways in the workplace when death fills the corporate air subtlely, creating a dust. It's natural of us to engage in a hide and seek situation and to discover honorable activities, a place of respect. In *Wake Up and Live!*, Dorothea Brande explains how that honorable movement simply flows when the being fears becoming: 

> *"If we manage to be fairly comfortable, to get some respect and admiration, a taste of 'a little brief authority,' and some love, we think we have made a good bargain, we acquiesce in the will to fail. We even pride ourselves on our shrewdness, not suspecting how badly we have been cheated, that we have settled for the compensations of death, not the rewards of life."* (Brande, Dorothea., 2014, p. 21)

<!--
@references 
* reference - Brande, D. (2014). Wake up and live. BN Publishing.

In *The Will to Fail*, Dorothea reminds us of our ability to find "good deals." But she is essentially invitinng us to see how powerful we are when we are into that will to fail: how far we can go, how busy we can get into these affairs. Consequently to consider how much of our creativity and enthusiasm can be energetically routed, as opposed to face engaging with growth. I like to see that situation as if we are thrown in a labirinth of mirrors knowing that a beast is there - setting us to be happy with a) what if we can escape or b) what if we can kill the beast but entirely missing the point that c) an actual labirinth was created. How could we, if all that we can see are ourselves?

One other special observation from Andy celebrates his own movement as a writer, were he essentially escaping when he were writing *High Output Management* and *Only the Paranoid Survive*?

> *"Frankly, as I look back, I have to wonder if it was an accident that I devoted a significant amount of my time in the years preceding our memory episode, years during which the storm clouds were already very evident, to writing a book. As I write this, I wonder what storm clouds I might be ducking now. I will probably know in a few years."*  (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

Certainly he is right and he were escaping to a place. But we too shall celebrate that his reflective experience reveals aspect of one honest personality, of one's courage to know, of one's willingness to go through the fears of knowing.

Now before we leave the ride with Andy, we should reconcile the situation of the grown-up entity in comparison with the individual as they go through the growth cycles in life. In the paper *Let Chaos Reign, Then Rein In Chaos* (2007), Andy joined professor Robert Burgelman and considered the two processes of movement, induced and autonomous. The induced is the one that expects and where prior know-how tells what to do. I like to think of it as a tops-down direction as in following a plan given a perspective known. While the autonomous could be the bottoms-up direction, where control has to be released, and certainly accepts the creative movement, a perspective to gain new perspectives. The key, as they highlight, is to make sure that once the business has achieved success, it needs to make sure that both processes exist: 

> *"Alert strategic leadership is cognizant of the important role of both induced and autonomous processes in strategy-making, tolerates a sufficient level of uncommitted resources and looseness in control to continue to maintain a portfolio of autonomous initiatives, and is able to select at the right time those that need to be converted to the discipline of the induced process in order to cope with nonlinear strategic dynamics"* (Burgelman & Grove, 2007).

In other words, as they ask for a conscious entity - a conscious organization or a conscious being - they too make us wonder of the preconditions for alternating between these modes. In this context, we shall to recount from the history of Intel, that Intel as a mother ship had acquired enough reserves, through its rise as the world leader as a manufacturer of memory. In addition, as a research organization, Intel had placed major investments in its microprocessor division. While the decision from top management was tough, when Intel had decided, to some extent it was known that it wasn't an arbitrary movement. This situation is not different from the conditions that a mother creates before her baby goes on to discovering the world, which we may celebrate from Maslow's observations: 

> *"But we know also that curiosity and exploration are 'higher' needs than safety, which is just to say that the need to feel safe, secure, unanxious, unafraid is prepotent, stronger over curiosity. Both in monkeys and in human children this can be openly observed. The young child in a strange environment will characteristically hang on to its mother and only then, venture out little by little from her lap to probe into things, to explore and to probe. If she disappears and he becomes frightened, the curiosity disappears until safety is restored. He explores only out of a safe harbour."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.61) 

<!--

* reference - Maslow, A. H. (2011). Toward the Psychology of Being. Martino Publishing.
-->




Now the point from Andy is exactly about the complex situation where it does not matter the size of the beast. The challenge is always a challenge. So when it was time for Intel to let the baby go, it comes the question of how that support is really being given? Is the mother really supporting and motivating the little one to go and to be access that space of autonomy in the new adventure or is the mother inducing because of mother fears? That space of confusion, is about to let chaos reign, because all mothers will fear. But once a decision is made, Andy makes a point about commitment of support - to reign in chaos - which is yet another struggling situation because again the general movement can be yet defensive, doing the right things. 

For Andy, in real life, when we give the go, even with all the good intentions where all is bright after we commit, we are very much into ducking:  

> *"Real life is - I want to do that. I'm going go to my best guy here and say, OK, you're going to go on this emerging stuff. And every general manager is going to jump on me: How can you pull him out of the business that pays all of our salaries? He says, OK, no, no, no, I was kidding. I was kidding. It was a bad idea. Bad idea. Let me take him. And he came up way below him, the other guy in the ranking. Let him do the new business. And he is really not very good. [...] Then we put him on the new area." (Grove, 2019, 32:55-33:36)

And so Andy wonders "is it not going to succeed because it was a bad idea in the first place? Or is it not going to succeed because we put our second class people on developing it?". This is how things happen in real life, he concludes.
