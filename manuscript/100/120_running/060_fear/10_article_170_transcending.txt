For writing, according to our Julia Cameron, it works and works and it is the only way, for real, to get there. Yes, fixing the grammar and a conscious path is a must. The same for entrepreneneuship, the release of control also involves allowence go the joy of the day and the release of stress of trying to control - being romantic control or systematic control. See, for founders, controlling sales, or success can also be romantic control. What matters is coordination, with time and opportunity, moving, and of course, managing goals from time to time.  







If we subtract the normal growth curve from Paul Graham's curve, we have the hill of promise:

[Figure of the hill of promise]

Then we can formalize that entrepreneurs must be aware of their urgent steps when they enter the launch field. Because launches promise. The most important point, number one, is awareness and managing expectations - we must thank Paul Graham for reminding us that if things calm down, if they get boring, if the customer doesn't show up, etc., etc.; you weren't the first to go through this and you won't be the last. This path demands you to continue, and use the calm to learn and improve your solution, business, product, relationship, etc.

Point number two, that the initial promise, the launch - call it what you will - should be seen more coldly, as an experiment. This is a mindset and doing so not only creates less frustration but also helps in structuring the episode with more rigor and less bet, like thinking it will work out. This model of strategizing says that there is an overarching meta control - as if it were a premeditated battle where the outcome, positive or negative, is always positive, an experiment.

Now, looking at a more generalized issue regarding these two valleys - all of them and those who created them are warning us so that we can proceed, to be resilient. That is the main message allied to the message that says we were not the first and we will not be the last who will face these valleys.

But connected to this idea is an optimistic view, if we assume that the investment is precisely in the field of the valley, if we think it is worth it. The valley, in the optimistic view, of that entrepreneur or group that sees it as a challenge - and that allows time and invests in the situation - is the great opportunity. The valley is the real work that must be done, and the process of walking through it needs to be nurtured. It all starts with permission and time allocated. It's not to say that time pressure should be eliminated, that no schedule is needed. But it is to say that the solution should not be dominated by a time schedule only and that sometimes the group needs to launch into the valley with positive energy, with an attitude of understanding the problem and with curiosity as its guide.

The valley is the opportunity, not the death.

The insight from a research cited by "Are You Afraid to Identify as a Leader?, has shown that how challenge it is to support the developement of leaders as the consideration of a self-identity of a leader, has brought reputational concerns. As an example, employees might fear being seen as autocratic, different, or unqualified, when they consider themselves to embrace the role of leaders. Their research  suggests that organizations can impact the development of leaders and support a viewpoint that affects the psychological standpoint as taking leadership roles can be viewed as positive, and can be shown to be an area that is oriented to skills, and not as an innate ability: 

> "In one study, we found that participants who listened to a podcast in which we framed leadership as risky were less likely to identify or act as leaders than those who listened to a podcast that described leadership as low-risk. This suggests that simply by presenting leadership as less risky and lower-stakes (for example, by clarifying that leadership mistakes are expected and will not be a black mark on an employee’s record), managers can help employees feel more comfortable seeing themselves as leaders." https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Why would perceptions of riskiness influence something as deeply ingrained as your identity? From a psychological standpoint, however, this effect is not surprising at all. No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might think." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "And across our studies, we found that people who reported higher levels of fear around these reputational risks were less likely to see themselves as leaders. As a result, they were less likely to act as leaders, and therefore less likely to be seen as leaders by their supervisors." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Running / Accessing - Consider the corporate case reflection from Andy and how it connects with the release from the "inertia of success" and encounter with the allowance for the curious case. @meta-refid 1223-6787-5456-9393

* Note - Inductive vs. Automous, check Andy's paper Let the Chaos Reign too - Growth up situation releases control? * Solution, to fear of growth, knowledge access - "Resolution of strategic dissonance does not come in the form of a figurative light bulb going on. It comes through experimentation. Loosen up the level of control that the organization normally is accustomed to. Let people try different techniques, review different products, exploit different sales channels, and go after different customers. Much as management has been devoted to making and keeping order in the company, at times like this they must become more tolerant of the new and the different. Only stepping out of the old ruts will bring new insights." Andy Grove, p.130, Only the Paranoid Survive 

* Note - To know or not to know - feat. Maslow - "In any case, this close relationship between knowing and doing can help us to interpret one cause of the fear of knowing as deeply a fear of doing, a fear of the consequences that flow from knowing, a fear of its dangerous responsibilities. Often it is better not to know, because if you did know, then you would have to act and stick your neck out. This is a little involved, a little like the man who said, "I'm so glad I don't like oysters, because if I liked oysters, I'd eat them, and I'd hate the darn things'" p.63 Toward the Psychology of Being. 

* #greatness #hubris * * * * * Note - "But we know also that curiosity and exploration are higher needs than safety, which is to say that the need to feel safe, secure, unanxious and afraid is prepotent, stronger over curiosity." and / and "The young child in a strange environment will characteristically hang on to its mother and only then venture out little by little from her lap to probe into things, to explore and to probe. If she disappears and he becomes frightened, the curiosity disappears until safety is restored. She explores only out of a safe harbor." p.61 of Toward the Psychology of Being. Note: The note from Maslow, by indicating the child situation, the connection is too direct between safety and the act to learn, to go seek, to discover. Logically, in the adult that is not at risk of losing its safety needs; but the point is that these models are used for risk movements, curious movements; it is coherent anyway to seek the new only when you can be safe about the mechanisms that let you seek in the first place. In p.54-55 Maslow also points the "subjective device" that is added to "principle of the hierarchical arrangements of our various needs," which may explain in part how our models for growth from the child are mapped as models to the adult growth.  This may also have to do with any psicanalysis generally goes back to childhood to explain to the adult that the mechanism does not need to apply. 

* #greatness #hubris #fright Note - * To know, acessing - "The moment of fright is quite understandable, but must nevertheless be overcome if creation is to be possible. Thus, to discover in oneself a great talent can certainly bring exhilaration, but it also brings a fear of the dangers and responsibilities and duties of being a leader and of being all alone. Responsibility can be seen as a heavy burden and evaded as long as possible. Think of the mixture of feelings of awe, humility, even of fright that have been reported to us, let us say, by people who have been elected president." Maslow p 58-59

* #hubris - On fear of hubris - or greatness - For the individual level this might have been better reflected; of a fear that is different from that fear of knowing, and the fear of responsibilty (feat. Maslow, Toward the Psychology of Being). The fear of hubris may be a fear of the established system's fear of the chaos which may be applicable to the individuals, or the individual units of a system, willing and interested in growth. When in doubt, about to grow big or to be struck, some of these may be stuck due to an outstanding suggestion by whoever controls a path for the societal system, asking to not access the Gods, to not go too far (this may be a view presented by Maslow). This in the view of Dorothea, could be related, she points the case that professors of writing generally in the very first lecture put upfront that genious cannot be taught, which Dorothea disagree. Her book, becoming a writer, is for that. The fear of Hubris might happen to be the esteem level regulator esteem-level editor? while the fear of knowledge and responsibility acting on other level? 

    * Self-esteem regulating "Therefore, we speak simply of fear of knowledge in general without discriminating to sharply fear of the inner from the fear of the outer. In general, this kind of fear is defensive in the sense that it is a protection of our self-esteem, of our love and respect for ourselves. We tend to be afraid of any knowledge that could cause us to despise ourselves or to make us inferior, weak, worthless, evil, shameful. We protect ourselves and our ideal image of ourselves by repression and similar defenses, which are essentially techniques by which we avoid becoming conscious of unpleasant or dangerous truths." p.57 Maslow in Toward the Psychology of Being

Some individuals, through projects in the corporate setting, are likely expressing an identity which is not a reflection of their true self of the present. The expression comes as they perform, as they see themselves as conductors for certain causes - it could be a key result ahead of a major objective. This expression might come in various ways as they see themselves in a role, or as supporters of a cause, such as a cause of other supporters, advocates, leaders, mentors, investors, angels, you name it. Naturally, the sky is the limit. 

From a storytelling perspective, a doer in a cause can be seen as a protagonist, or a messenger, or a conductor. Although what they do involves a set of specialized actions and behaviors, like when one is in control of how they act, the performer displays and develop behaviors that at the same time express and shape their identities.  

Framing from a storytelling perspective will helps us to understand how emotions, such as feelings of loss, are experienced quite strong to a point of governing decisions - thus the use of our scarce resources. The book Storynomics (2018), whose audience is marketers interested in improving their communications, shows how people's perception about things can influence decisions. The authors refer to a selection of scientific works that shows that people's perceptions about pain (or pleasure) are felt based on what is presented to them - as in narrated - influencing them from how they imagine the given narrative. The selection of studies presented (2018, p.43) does justice to this idea by supporting scientific evidence for what the world of advertising has long before cracked, and profited for a while [^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics], althought generally understood as a subject of persuasion.

[^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics]: 

Now the fact that the advertising "of the west world" has discovered - by measuring results with customers - reveals that people decide based on narratives and stories that they are told and listen. In other words, it matters a lot - minimally for advertising agencies as we can confirm - that in the end of the day people bring to their lives, that they decide, based on what they listen, no matter if the the stories told are seen as persuasive forms of communication, or emotional communication, rhetoric, and on and on. Or, from another perspective, the advertising of the west didn't invent, indeed, as they had more like discovered, or understood, the natural mechanism of how people decide from the perspectives from the narratives that they are told. In part three, we will explore further the subject of human communication as narration [^footnote_prelude_human_narration] but for now we will maintain the equilibrium by focusing on how fear drives us, or how fears enter our narrative that drive us. 

[^footnote_prelude_human_narration]: The work of Walter Fisher, Human Communication as Narration, will support us to improve our awareness of how people reason and decise based on the the experiences that they tell and listen. 

But if what is told makes people fear is only does so effectively in the face of an ongoing conversaion, an ongoing train that is moving. We recognize this train of thought if we imagine a team of people in a locomotive where the destination is a city but out of the sudden the train stops right before a bridge. In this situation, if someone says that they might have stopped to appreciate the view, some people might laugh or be mad with the realization of the irony or how the observation does not fit the reality of what is happening. Thus the storied context makes the possibility for what is told to be coherent or not, to be truthful or not. Thus in the tracks of our work projects, such as an entrepreneurial effort, w happens is that things go awry, or appears to be going in the bad direction, exactly as we want things to go in a certain direction, such as to stop by a key result associated with a higher-order objective or destination. All sort of situations that trigger fears such as the consideration that projects are going to be abruptly terminated, such as that layoffs as necessary, or if an entire division needs to be closed. And how certain things are triggered to our lives appears in different ways, because one may feel compassion for the people who could be affected, or when a leader feels in a position of being a messenger for a cause, a train conductor, you name it. Just as a train conductor is happy when the train is running smoothly and feels bad when it's no longer operational, the context of entrepreneurship and businesses also means a track of possibilities where the performers are protagonists who cares more than being apatic participants in a train moving to a random place. We aren't moving to an arbitrary place and we are not apatic participants. We are moving towards aspiring goals and we are humans. 

Thus the work situation, and especially the entrepreneurial situation, creates a storied context where certain values are established and helps to create an equilibrium. These values can be acessed if we dig into reflecting within actionable ideas like "we need to keep working in this project tonight" which might be associated with expectations of significant milestones, such as expected state of happiness of the team, expected state of security to the team or the project, or any measure of success that is ahead. Thus it's natural for a person's identity to be linked as a responsible being, as a protagonist, emotionally and ethically connected to a duty. Conversely, it is natural to expect that a failure to do so, to operate towards the success, might trigger an actual real impact to their lives, like the unsolvency of their ability to work, which triggers other fears as, for example, people may need to work for money or other reason they hold as value. Suddenly, due to various factors, external or internal, experienced or perceived, the protagonists find themselves crafting narratives that are powerful in the face of the experience of fears they project.

Diverging or transcending?
-->

What we can take away from this, once again, is a simple idea but one that we cannot ignore—we are human, we feel, and we will likely coordinate our entrepreneurial actions based on emotions. However, this doesn't mean we can't take time to recognize and reflect on all this. If the former Intel CEO recognizes that he was escaping from a larger problem by writing a book, could it be that we also sometimes engage in certain responsible actions as a form of blocking or self-defense to avoid feeling loss or strong emotions like fear and insecurity?

The point was given somewhere else here in the book. As for the book ref, his points are given within "Let Chaos Reign" of - @meta-refid 1222-2333-4333-7666 

* "With all the rhetoric about how management is about change, the fact is that we managers loathe change, especially when it involves us. Getting to a strategic inflection point involves confusion, uncertainty and disorder, both on a personal level if you are in management and on a strategic level for the enterprise as a whole. These two levels are more intimately connected than one might think." Andy Grove, p.123, Only the Paranoid Survive. 

* We should also consider that the corporate version goes through the very exercise of transcending, such as when these companies fall into the modes of bets (check the usage of various levels of bets by the following paper article ft. Andy Grove). The consideration of a new style changing strategy, is then the realization of the need for transcending, searching a wider view - writing a book, acquision of companies, pre-mortem, you name it.

* "It is instructive to follow this development. What started as an autonomous initiative with Centrino during the tenure of one CEO became the driving force of the induced strategy process - by the name “platformization” - under the next CEO in early 2005.

Andy Grove also articulated a corporate version of the potential for loss, self-defense—a situation where companies going through said inflection points decide to buy other companies. He questioned, in "Only the Paranoid Survive," why Japanese electronics companies, undergoing significant changes in their markets and industry, bought movie studios. For Grove, this could represent a form of escapism that ends up completely occupying managers' attention; they become too busy, they want to be occupied.
