#### The startup mirage 

Now, having us considered how fears take us to run or to grow or to be defensive, let us consider the startup situation. Not unlike the individual situation, as we know, our teams movement is to a greater extent done by interactions with the external environment. Thus as a team, we know it too the basics, that we can be quite into doing what we do by taking advantage of cheaper interactions, navigating fragments of data, getting feedback, these things; as the logic tell us, to probe first before taking higher bets. 

This situation set us to check about if fears can play an influence, such as when we are trying to do what is right in ways that take us to make bad decisions. But more than that, we are, again, concerned with a particular situation: if on that path we take our teams into being blocked; just like the young writer who when trying to be right ends up writing poor things, disconnected from what she wants to do, and being bored and potentially stuck. In other words, and again but for the startup team, can our fears to be wrong take us into that  B to A path that can take us to C? To a place of confusion? We will look at two situations which are essentially acts of publishing, which can be magical, seen like a treat, but also can be poisonous, can be tricky.

The first situation is us navigating through using social media interactions. This, as many of us know, is a kind of interaction where one goes to explore that social tree with the intention to collect fruits. It's like a giving, that we can navigate through the social tree and collect these things that make us happy in big ways.

Now, for this magical possibility to happen we need to consider some of the elements from the networked and digital space. One of them is the Like button. As you may recall from the chapter Identity we have considered the story of Wyrathu and his interactions through social media which Max Fisher considered as a parallel reality leading to violent attacks in Myanmar. Fisher's went further in *The Chaos Machine* (2022) to note an inflection point where Facebook had discovered the potential of the Like button. We know what is like to like. We can instantly support or connect with fellow friends or others. We can like a poem, celebrate an achievement, that sort of thing. But Fisher pointed to a greater discovery that, for whoever posts, the *Like Button*, and along with it the *Like Counter*, works as a gauge mechanism. This is where he hooked the theory of the *Sociometer* by Mark Leary [^footenote_sociometer] which considers a particular perspective for self-esteem as a "psychological measure of the degree to which people perceive that they are relationally valued and socially accepted by other people" (Fisher, 2022, p. 44).

[^footenote_sociometer]: Sociometer theory posits that self-esteem is a psychological gauge of the degree to which individuals perceive that they are relationally valued and accepted by others.

In other words, and through the oceans of social platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, WhatsApp and others, authors (anyone who actively posts) are essentially navigating by posting baits and fishing likes; thus satisfing their needs which regulates their self-esteem. 

Now, to consider our publishing acts in the social as fishing acts it surely set us into a dilemma. From one hand we could fear to be evil, as in to be the one who is fishing for results at the expense of the social, people. On the other hand, one could be naive fishers subject trapped by the waters and enchanted by the likes taking to nowhere, as following the weak likes. Now, and in reality for entrepreneurs, these extremmes are extremmes which set us to dismiss these thoughts since startup teams are different. To a certain extent they know that they are different from the normal. They are just in navigating in the space of discovery, they know, so they are in the middle - as a goal - not evil nor naive. They are in it, for the sake of seeking what is best, for them and for their customers, so what they do has to be legitimate. Plus, back to the premisses, after all all that we do we do because it's all a space for learning. 

Now, Fisher highlights too another dimension of how these things happen in the digital and networked space, as a major difference between the Likes from the digital and networked space and the Likes from the offline world: 

> *"It's not just that 'likes' provide the social validation we invest so much energy in obtaining; it's that they offer this validation with an immediacy and scale that was unprecedented in human experience."* (Fisher, 2022, p. 45)

He is saying that life was not like that. That applause was rare. And that in the offline, and slower world, likes and applauses went along with conversations. With that Fisher had unlocked a chaotic potential from the fact that in the online things happen in lightening fast ways. One may post, in a beautiful Saturday by the flow of a romantic song and out of the blue be struck by a lightening. In other words, you can take 1.2 gigawatz of applauses that can take you to different future. Fisher is reminding us that in this modern sea fishing now happens with a net. And that can be part of a normal morning that we may get lost in the enchantment under that sea. As a result, we shall wonder: Can our so called entrepreneurial minds really understand what is going on with our present? 

So we may think of each little bait, each post, as a low cost movement. That applauses aren't that big (in cost terms anyway). We may even think of these interactions in mechanical ways, placing small bets, small baits, that we are fishing results: more views, followers, and feedback, therefore learning. From that strategic position, it becomes clear that if anyone is a victim these might be them users. In addition to that, a whole world of professionals supports this movement, characterized by digital influencers, marketeers, media specialists, you name it. All promoting that practices in the social media are in a way or another normal and telling us that we are in control.  

Many things may come from the one that gets addicted to like this practice, even the occasional posts. In particular if we are in it to expect an eventual winning post we are essentially setting ourselves to depend. And the price we may is in terms of focus because some small wins may hint us of a potential big win. A consideration, for whoever are "posting occasionally" as an unofficial activity, would be to turn that into an official activity. To consider all the effort, from ideas to drafts to polish work, as things accounted, in alignment with our entitled Accounting. Although we pay a price for accounting, our involvement and partially a pain, it may set us to to know, to be aware, to be responsible, and evaluate and judge our actions in front of our goals.

@outline - The mirrage of validation 
--> 


In their pursuit of growth, as entrepreneurs may not notice them chasing validation or conscious, it may be so exactly because of the value-system and their understanding that these are interactions in ways that support their project development by checking with the outside world. Paul Graham, in his talk *Before the Startup with Paul Graham* (How to Start a Startup 2014: Lecture 3), had alerted a whole class of young founders to the risk of that instinctive movement: 

> *"[...] Starting a statup is where gaming the system stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. [...] Giving the impression of productivity by sending emails late at night. [...] But in startups, that does not work. [...] There is no boss to trick. There's no, how can you trick people if there's no one to trick? There's only users. [...] You can't, like, wave a red flag at a shark and fool it, it's like, meat or no meat. So, you have to have something people want. [...] And you only prosper to the extend that you do. The dangerous thing is, particularly for you guys, the dangerous thing is that faking does work to some extent with investors. You, if you're really good at knowing what you're talking about. You can fool investors for one, maybe two rounds of funding. But it's not in your interest to. I mean, you're all doing this for equity. You're playing a confidence trick on yourself. You're wasting your own time. "* Paul Graham (2014, Y Combinator: The Vault)

Charman (2015), in his article *The difference between Bootcamps, Incubators and Accelerators,* raises the question about not only of the self movement of entrepreneurs into the possibility of gaming the system, but also of themselves to be induced by the very systems meant to support them, i.e. accelerators, incubators, and bootcamps. He states: "We see more and more people self-qualifying their own personal achievements, and using these to drive their business and their media behind it." This observation raises an important consideration - that there is to some extent that instinctive game the system possibility - such as the one that Paul Graham might have suggested which likely has origins in universities as known so far - but there is also some other systems of acceleration that might be in fact inducing, to some extent, the possibility of setting the team to seek the results such as in a hurry, which may take the team to not even realize it the necessary conscious view for it. The social system in which we might be navigating can be in away a probing system - not to say a game - in itself that can confuse us. The systems, supposedly the projection of real life, nevertheless an environment such as percepived by the interactions with social media, may not reflect the actual reality towards your goal.

Silicon Valley investor Andrew Chen, and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, highlights the well-discussed pattern as observed by these top-tier folks: a situation that many founders fall to, top-tier teams included not mattering how smart they are. This is known as the *Trough of Sorrow* and refers to the situation when a startup face a challenging moment which follows from moments of launch efforts, when they "go public" with their in-development products. In the article, *After the TechCrunch bump: Life in the âTrough of Sorrow"* [^footnote_andrewchen_trough], he describes the drawing of the *Trough of Sorrow* which may well represent the self-esteem going along with the social reactions. The movement starts, to the right, and the team self-esteem and social feedback goes up, and it reaches the climax of launch which is characterized by the moment when they get good press about what they did. But then, reality sets in, and different than the ride of a rollercoaser, the ride down is generally boring and can also consume the team. The point of the cartoon is that the recovering period if far in the future. Thus Chen is asking them to pay attention, to be calmer, to know that this is where the actual work could start, could happen or should happen, when slower or calmer learning is helpful. 

[^footnote_andrewchen_trough]: In *After the TechCrunch bump: Life in the âTrough of Sorrow"*, Andrew Chen, partner-investor at A16Z, had reflected about a pattern which was discussed with Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, and others colleagues, a pattern that shows a struggle that founders live through as they launch their early "products."

Chen's article is an wake up call as one that says "Hey founders, this is normal" or "folks, that wasn't a real product that you had promoted there" or "people, things are hard" or "team, don't fight much over this, move on" or "founder, don't quit." But the point from these investors not only shows how urgently founders enter the ride and fall to the mirage but reveals too that they are essentially inviting themselves into that space. We can see that too by the word, *TechCrunch* [^footnote_techcrunch], incrusted in the title of the article. So right there, it cannot be missed that many founders are into a kind of "right ride" to launch their "hot new products," where they are essentially building up stories of themselves as "hot founders," and the like. Andrew too reminded them of that, that "working on press mentions, conferences, etc," is not enough [^footnote_andrew_press]. What is inescapable is: how can these founders got to be induced into the track consisting of publishing as in launching, certainly taking advantage of the news and publications good feedback and insights, but in a way without knowing that the movement that they are doing and the interactions from the audiences is not really real? Why do they miss the nuanced observation, the meta-analysis of what will happen? Why the pattern is observed in the first place? That they do want to interact in cheaper ways, they know that. That they are into a path for improving things, for learning, perhaps pivoting, they know it too. But into that, why is it that when the limelights sets in, they fall into that trap movement as if they got famous and as if their brands or product were real? And why is is that when the light shuts down they get bored, or even blocked in ways to quit? In other words, they fell into creating a narrative for themselves. 


[^footnote_techcrunch]: TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news. They launched in 2005. More on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch

[^footnote_andrew_press]: In 2018, June 20, Andrew reminded founders, with a note on his Twitter channel, that  "Working on press mentions, conferences, etc., can be a good way to get an initial traffic boost.

Harrison Metal investor Michael Dearing, when interviewed by Reid Hoffman about what things founders (in the early stage) should ignore, had first acknowledged how critical it is for all teams to have a list of things to be ignored. We should celebrate that [^footnote_michaeldearing_reflection_awareness]. Then, and to the point, he pointed about press or the acts of PR, or as he put it, *freakni' PR*, as a big something to ignore:

> *"One of the things I wish was on your list, and maybe it is further down is freakin' PR. And the idea that founders are brands and that companies need to have high profile and be written about by whomever is a lie. It's a complete and total lie. And it's manufactured by the people who sell ads for page views to convince you that you need to talk to them. And it's a complete and total lie. You may decide for your own reasons to go do PR for your company, but it doesn't actually change the outcome. In fact many times it can actually tip the outcome in the wrong direction, and recruiting is a perfect example of this. If you are deciding to do PR because of recruiting, the people you'll attract are the wrong people. Because most of your life, as a company, will be spent not being written about in a flattering way. And so if that's what they need to be motivated, then they're going to be very disappointed."* Michael Dearing (Greylock, 2015, 1:00:41)

[^footnote_michaeldearing_reflection_awareness]: It is very tempting for one to pick a question and wonder about the answer. But Michael, before replying the question to Reid, made a point, highlighted, that teams should have a list of things to ignore. He is celebrating too the question from Reid, he is asking us to pause, and he is reminding us that of a level of awareness about what we do.

This view, of the effects of the down movement to the life of the team might be good enough reason for us to think of going public, and interactions with the social, as a subject more than signal or noise. Teams may not be prepared for that, to take in the excitement of reaching the high places as something cold, and to learn and to be motivated when we go down, into that place of sorrow. If what works is the other way around, then we aren't really in control, and we are essentially being controlled by the movement and too - to be considered - that we are controlling the project of success exactly because we are frigthened of being wrong. And the result, the more we go in that direction? Just like the writer entering the space of confusion and "being bored out of writing" which can block their creative being, we can too take our teams to be blocked, out of our best creative condition or flexible condition and unable to engage in change. That is why consequences like the considerations to quit become real.
