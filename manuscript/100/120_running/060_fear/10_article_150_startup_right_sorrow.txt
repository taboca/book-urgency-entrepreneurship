### Motivated by social validation 

What we have just considered is a trying to be right that follows from trying to not fail or even from being frightened of being wrong. This certainly requires a celebration - it is a fear that influences a direction and that set us to be productive. Conversely, it also set us into being blocked, such as when the young writer does not enjoy writing from that movement of being right that disconnects from being honest. It is implied, by this illustration, the connection between being right and the external environment driving the disconnect between being real and the internal being. Now, as we leave that writer case we shall welcome other settings of entrepreneurs too are navigating towards growth. We will find that what happens with the startup situation, and even with grown up companies, is not much different. The common aspect starts with the fact that they all are trying to grow with the support from what they think are the external environment. 

Considering first the startup situation, we should first acknowledge that they now operated in a quite dynamic space. In other words, and because we are networked, we engage in interactions with our external environment as a means to navigate further, to develop something, even in the early stage. This kind of interaction is generally seen as a good because it means cheaper interactions, data, feedback, these things. In other words, we are in it to learn fast, and then to only make higher bets after initial bets, some probing, that sort of thing. What we will consider though, is that the team in the early stage is essentially building a narrative. And with that, and with online interactions and in trying to do the right steps, they too can take themselves to build a poor narrative, not taking them to make a great product, and great team. The grand risk, on the other hand, is that they may take to make a poor product or making of them a team that is blocked, just like the poor writing and a blocked writer went along. Again, this is a team trying to go from B to A but taking themselves into a C-space, a place of confusion. 

One possibility for building that kind of journey is to use the social, using social media platforms. From the positive side, anything narrated to this ground can mean learning, as in learning in real-time, with our the audiences. What an opportunity to learn from posting, to get feedback, and even perhap to build a brand while doing it. Now this magical narrative only happens because of some other elements of the networked and digital world. To elaborate about the dynamics we should consider first the potential given by the Like button. According Max Fisher, in his book *The Chaos Machine: The Inside Story of How Social Media Rewired Our Minds and Our World* (2022), Facebook made a significant leap in the platform's potential for engagement after launching the Like button. Certainly, as users, we know the positive side of the Like button: We can instantly connect with friends, support a poem, celebrate an achievement of a relative, that kind of thing. But Facebook's great discovery also involved learning that, for the one that posts, the Like button and the Like Counter function as gauge mechanism that they can see how successful they are doing. To explain this, Fisher hooked the theory of the *Sociometer* by Mark Leary [^footenote_sociometer] that sees self-esteem as a "psychological measure of the degree to which people perceive that they are relationally valued and socially accepted by other people" (Fisher, 2022, p. 44).

[^footenote_sociometer]: Sociometer theory posits that self-esteem is a psychological gauge of the degree to which individuals perceive that they are relationally valued and accepted by others.

The result is that in the wide ocean of social platforms - LinkedIn, Instagram, WhatsApp and virtually any platform - our dependence on posting (and to receive likes) reveals how we may use the medium to actually satisfy our needs but to too to regulate self-esteem. Now, to consider that our acts - by these these social network movements - means something critical to our teams, and to our startup paths, could be perhaps a nuisance, if think about it in a hurry. We have good reasons not to worry about that and this may be so because we do see ourselves as beings that are different from the normal people, the normal user condition. It has to be, right? We entrepreneurs are the ones that to some extent, or better extent anyway, can manipulate the world. We create new recipes, we cook things. We don't eat the junk or get trapped by eating habits. 

But what we are not aware too is that the volatily of ours interaction builds up very concrete outcomes for ourselves, likely by the very fact that the networks are real, and all connected. It is the world, on the other hand. And it is our presence, our product, our narrative. Fisher highlights to us another major difference of the Like given in the digital and networked space - its potential due the immediacy and scale: 

> *"It's not just that 'likes' provide the social validation we invest so much energy in obtaining; it's that they offer this validation with an immediacy and scale that was unprecedented in human experience." (Fisher, 2022, p. 45)

He is saying that life was not like this. Applause was rare, especially in public. And in the slower world, likes and applauses were likely counterbalanced with conversations. Now, as he explain the chaotic potential, on social networks especially given that the networked situation is lightening fast, an aggregation of applauses can be part of a normal morning.  As a result, the entrepreneurial mind which in a normal day would feel in control, thinking that these actions where some small strategic actions - these are just likes, nothing more - 
Or even, we know the low cost of a post, we know that these applauses are not that big, we don't feel victims of the need for these Likes. Consider, for example, a communication plan where entrepreneurs are engaged in a larger, long-term strategy that gives a sense of control – we only decide to support our business, we are just making some posts. Additionally, they may even do it mechanically with the aim of supporting their brand or value proposition. They may even automate that nowadays, asking an AI tool to do it. In this sense, it signals that they are aware that they are free from the negative potential of the interactions - as in they won't feel bad when engagement does not occur. They think that they are not in the zone of dependence on the likes associated with their posts. It's as if they see themselves as the one flying over, perhaps even more of that when they are in "post, post, post" mode. They may even see all of that as iterative learning, small bets, that they are accumulating results, such as more views, more followers, more feedback. When questioned about if they depend on the acceptance, applauses and likes, they may even say that they don't even look in realtime, that they collect the interactions first and positive results a week after. Nothing could go wrong with this idea. And again, they have a clear thought, resulting from their strategic and special place, that if anyone can be a real victim of the situation, these might be their users. It's like a basic math that gives carte blanche to advance digital communication on social networks. Consider the number of people around you from the business world, such as digital influencers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners, who promote these methods and practices for social media activity. In this situation, even if your project idea is the most physical in the world, like a plate of food, it becomes quite normal now to think that everything can proceed with actions that goes on in digital medium of social networks.

In this process, the cost to be paid may first appear as not so damaging, as in to be seen as a team wasting energy, or time. This may be so because we see these interactions not as key activities, first. And this is so too exactly because these mediuns are driven to positive interactions too. Thus, the real case of a test of the sociometer in action may show how happy the team becomes after a comment from someone successful, like an influencer. Next is myself being happy that an investor liked my post: 

> *"I don't forget my first user who commented on a post on my channel 'Uncle of the Valley,' about entrepreneurship. It was the angel investor João Kepler. In fact, that day, I had sent a post to a friend who knew João Kepler and tagged him. João Kepler liked the post. It was very cool."* – Marcio S Galli, https://www.instagram.com/tiodovale

While potential results can be great - my self esteem was high that day - we too see that these practical actions are low cost. But in our mind, in the world of our narratives, we are connected to that, and it may too consume us. The price we pay for increasing our network, our channels, is becoming attached to the narrative that grows, many of them fragmented first, but moving the needle anyway, such as the total number of followers or a comment from someone special. We become dependent on the narrative as a whole, and it can change our behavior. The more we watch what we sign up for, such as our numbers, the more we believe that our entrepreneurship occurs and that it may be given by that kind of data. But the cost to be paid is not in the possibility of the project's failure if these signals do not resonate with the reality and truths the business or project will face. The cost is in the emotional condition we reach when we face disappointment or when, despite the peaks of dopamine and excitement, we are still pursuing the larger goal that is not resolved day by day. With this, we can find ourselves cornered, or letting time pass, without considering another environment and believing that environment is real.

In defense of another category that posts occasionally without much dedication, a note is worth mentioning. In practice, perhaps many of us do not dedicate specific time to social media posts. It's something light, we do it occasionally like "Look, my company is more than this, I just post and it doesn't even wear us out." But consider the cost to be paid when taking this path, once the individual(s) position themselves in defense, at face value. Who could hold responsibility for something done in free time or in strategic time slots? As if saying, "Oh, it's just some posts I do occasionally." We don't stop to consider that much of what we do, such as things in free time and escapes from time, can actually be things we expect a lot from. It is not logically and well-defined charges, but it consumes silently. And this is exactly the addiction game that Mark Leary suggests. For example, when a person goes there and makes another post believing that perhaps one of them will be a winning post. On one hand, it suggests a construction narrative, without major losses. On the other, it is treading a behavior and a dependence. The focus pays the price. A basic recommendation, if one day you think about "posting occasionally" as an unofficial activity; consider turning this into an official activity. Consider that everything you do for your business should be accounted for during working hours, and you should be responsible and evaluate and judge it in front of your goals.

#### The mirage of validation

In their pursuit of growth, entrepreneurs may find themselves in a chase for validation, attempting to control - not to say manipulate - the interaction in ways that supports the project development by acceptance from the outside world. Paul Graham, in his talk *Before the Startup with Paul Graham* (How to Start a Startup 2014: Lecture 3), had alerted a whole class of generally young founders to the risk of that instinctive movement: 

> *"[...] Starting a statup is where gaming the system stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. [...] Giving the impression of productivity by sending emails late at night. [...] But in startups, that does not work. [...] There is no boss to trick. There's no, how can you trick people if there's no one to trick? There's only users. [...] You can't, like, wave a red flag at a shark and fool it, it's like, meat or no meat. So, you have to have something people want. [...] And you only prosper to the extend that you do. The dangerous thing is, particularly for you guys, the dangerous thing is that faking does work to some extent with investors. You, if you're really good at knowing what you're talking about. You can fool investors for one, maybe two rounds of funding. But it's not in your interest to. I mean, you're all doing this for equity. You're playing a confidence trick on yourself. You're wasting your own time. *" Paul Graham (2014, Y Combinator: The Vault)

Charman (2015), in his article *The difference between Bootcamps, Incubators and Accelerators,* raises the question about not only of the self movement of entrepreneurs into the possibility of gaming the system, but also of themselves to be induced by the very systems meant to support them, i.e. accelerators, incubators, and bootcamps. He states: "We see more and more people self-qualifying their own personal achievements, and using these to drive their business and their media behind it." This observation raises an important consideration - that there is to some extent that instinctive game the system possibility - such as the one that Paul Graham might have suggested which likely has origins in universities as known so far - but there is also some other systems of acceleration that might be in fact inducing, to some extent, the possibility of setting the team to seek the results such as in a hurry, which may take the team to not even realize it the necessary conscious view for it. The social system in which we might be navigating can be in away a probing system - not to say a game - in itself that can confuse us. The systems, supposedly the projection of real life, nevertheless an environment such as percepived by the interactions with social media, may not reflect the actual reality towards your goal.

Silicon Valley investor Andrew Chen, and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, highlights the well-discussed pattern as observed by these top-tier folks: a situation that many founders fall to, top-tier teams included not mattering how smart they are. This is known as the *Trough of Sorrow* and refers to the situation when a startup face a challenging moment which follows from moments of launch efforts, when they "go public" with their in-development products. In the article, *After the TechCrunch bump: Life in the “Trough of Sorrow"* [^footnote_andrewchen_trough], he describes the drawing of the *Trough of Sorrow* which may well represent the self-esteem going along with the social reactions. The movement starts, to the right, and the team self-esteem and social feedback goes up, and it reaches the climax of launch which is characterized by the moment when they get good press about what they did. But then, reality sets in, and different than the ride of a rollercoaser, the ride down is generally boring and can also consume the team. The point of the cartoon is that the recovering period if far in the future. Thus Chen is asking them to pay attention, to be calmer, to know that this is where the actual work could start, could happen or should happen, when slower or calmer learning is helpful. 

[^footnote_andrewchen_trough]: In *After the TechCrunch bump: Life in the “Trough of Sorrow"*, Andrew Chen, partner-investor at A16Z, had reflected about a pattern which was discussed with Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, and others colleagues, a pattern that shows a struggle that founders live through as they launch their early "products."

Chen's article is an wake up call as one that says "Hey founders, this is normal" or "folks, that wasn't a real product that you had promoted there" or "people, things are hard" or "team, don't fight much over this, move on" or "founder, don't quit." But the point from these investors not only shows how urgently founders enter the ride and fall to the mirage but reveals too that they are essentially inviting themselves into that space. We can see that too by the word, *TechCrunch* [^footnote_techcrunch], incrusted in the title of the article. So right there, it cannot be missed that many founders are into a kind of "right ride" to launch their "hot new products," where they are essentially building up stories of themselves as "hot founders," and the like. Andrew too reminded them of that, that "working on press mentions, conferences, etc," is not enough [^footnote_andrew_press]. What is inescapable is: how can these founders got to be induced into the track consisting of publishing as in launching, certainly taking advantage of the news and publications good feedback and insights, but in a way without knowing that the movement that they are doing and the interactions from the audiences is not really real? Why do they miss the nuanced observation, the meta-analysis of what will happen? Why the pattern is observed in the first place? That they do want to interact in cheaper ways, they know that. That they are into a path for improving things, for learning, perhaps pivoting, they know it too. But into that, why is it that when the limelights sets in, they fall into that trap movement as if they got famous and as if their brands or product were real? And why is is that when the light shuts down they get bored, or even blocked in ways to quit? In other words, they fell into creating a narrative for themselves.

Harrison Metal investor Michael Dearing, when interviewed by Reid Hoffman about what things founders (in the early stage) should ignore, had first acknowledged how critical it is for all teams to have a list of things to be ignored. This is Michael making the point, first, that a team needs to be conscious about what they do and how they do. Moreover, goes straight to consider how teams engage in going public as a mechanism for being motivated: 

> *"One of the things I wish was on your list, and maybe it is further down is freakin' PR. And the idea that founders are brands and that companies need to have high profile and be written about by whomever is a lie. It's a complete and total lie. And it's manufactured by the people who sell ads for page views to convince you that you need to talk to them. And it's a complete and total lie. You may decide for your own reasons to go do PR for your company, but it doesn't actually change the outcome. In fact many times it can actually tip the outcome in the wrong direction, and recruiting is a perfect example of this. If you are deciding to do PR because of recruiting, the people you'll attract are the wrong people. Because most of your life, as a company, will be spent not being written about in a flattering way. And so if that's what they need to be motivated, then they're going to be very disappointed."* Michael Dearing (Greylock, 2015, 1:00:41)

This view, of the effects of the down movement to the life of the team might be good enough reason for us to think of going public, and interactions with the social, as a subject more than signal or noise. Teams may not be prepared for that, to take in the excitement of reaching the high places as something cold, and to learn and to be motivated when we go down, into that place of sorrow. If what works is the other way around, then we aren't really in control, and we are essentially being controlled by the movement and too - to be considered - that we are controlling the project of success exactly because we are frigthened of being wrong. And the result, the more we go in that direction? Just like the writer entering the space of confusion and "being bored out of writing" which can block their creative being, we can too take our teams to be blocked, out of our best creative condition or flexible condition and unable to engage in change. That is why consequences like the considerations to quit become real.
