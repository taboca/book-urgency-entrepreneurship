#### Trough of sorrow 

There's nothing much different between the journey of the self and the journey of a team in a startup situation. Although the startup situation of the team might be, in some circumstances, quite complicated, as they will be sucked into the whirlpool of social validation. In the entrepreneurial journey, the pressure for growth and rapid expansion is constant. Additionally, the desire for validation and social acceptance often leads entrepreneurs to invest in social media interactions as a way to advance – which is good. However, this immersion can be a double-edged sword: while it offers instant feedback and visibility, it is also a fertile ground for self-validation based on superficial feedback that does not represent validation for the future of the business.

How can we understand this dynamic and help entrepreneurs avoid these pitfalls? To address this issue, it is important to reflect on the factors that contribute to this problematic situation, starting with how social media communications are used as mechanisms to regulate the entrepreneur's self-esteem, leading to a mirage of progress. In the course of these reflections, consider the importance of not cheating the validation system and understanding how validation systems are also flawed.

#### The Pursuit of Positive Feedback on Social Media

Digital platforms, especially social media, have become a potential ground for quick feedback and popularity. Entrepreneurs, driven by the potential volume of interactions, may confuse social approval with progress, propelling them into a cycle of self-validation instead of genuine growth.

This phenomenon can be explained through Mark Leary's 'Sociometer' theory, as contextualized by Max Fisher in his book "The Chaos Machine: How Social Media Reprogrammed Our Minds and Our World" (2023). According to the author, Facebook made a significant leap in engagement after launching the Like button. Certainly, as users, we know the positive side of the Like button, which allows us to instantly connect with friends, support a poem, a celebration, or a theme that someone in your network launched. But Facebook's great discovery is that for the person posting, the Like button and the like counter function as a sociometer: a mechanism that feeds our self-esteem. In this sense, Fisher brings Leary's definition of self-esteem as a "psychological measure of the degree to which people perceive that they are valued in relationships and socially accepted by others" (Fisher, 2023, p. 44).

Logically, we know that these features are present on many other social platforms, such as LinkedIn, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Although this idea about our dependence on posting (to receive likes) may signal a relationship with self-esteem regulation, we still have good reasons not to worry about it and activate the posting mode when undertaking.

The act of entrepreneurship implies that the entrepreneurial mode is different from the "normal" user condition. It's as if the entrepreneurial mode gives us a status like "now I'm not just any user, now I'm in control."

But what we are not necessarily aware of is that we are advancing a narrative about our entrepreneurial action in general. When Facebook realized the power of the Like button, the social network created something more. According to Fisher (2023), "It's not just that 'likes' provide the social validation we invest so much energy in obtaining; it's that they offer this validation with an immediacy and scale that was unprecedented in human experience" (p. 45). He suggests that life was not like this; applause was rare, especially in public. He indicates that, on social networks, receiving many applauses can be part of a normal morning.

As a result, the entrepreneurial mind, which feels in control, recognizes these actions as small strategic actions. They are just likes, nothing more. Or even, we know the low cost of a post, we know that these applause are not that big, we don't feel victims of the need for these Likes. Consider, for example, a communication plan where entrepreneurs are engaged in a larger, long-term strategy that gives a sense of control – we only decide to support our business, we are just making some posts. Additionally, they may even do it mechanically with the aim of supporting their brand or value proposition. In this sense, they are aware that they do not feel bad when engagement does not occur; they are not in the zone of dependence on the likes associated with each post. It's as if they see themselves as the one flying over, in "post, post, post" mode, because they know they are accumulating results, such as followers and more views. When questioned about depending on the acceptance of Likes, they say they don't even look and that the posts are light, with positive results week after week. Nothing could go wrong with this idea. Additionally, they have a clear thought, resulting from their strategic position, that the real victims are their users.

It's like a basic math that gives carte blanche to advance digital communication on social networks. Consider the number of people around you from the business world, such as digital influencers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners, who promote these methods and practices for social media activity. In this situation, even if your project idea is the most physical in the world, like a plate of food, it becomes natural to think that everything can proceed with actions in digital media and social networks.

In this process, which does not necessarily appear urgent, the cost to be paid may lie in the use of energy, time, and focus on digital activities; with metrics focused solely on the "strategic" action itself, such as the total number of followers or even following some opportunity that suddenly arises on a beautiful day. A simple test, to see if the sociometer is in action for the team of entrepreneurs, consists of noting how happy the team is when a comment from someone successful, like an influencer, appears. See the situation of the user "Uncle of the Valley" of this author:

> *"I don't forget my first user who commented on a post on my channel 'Uncle of the Valley,' about entrepreneurship. It was the angel investor João Kepler. In fact, that day, I had sent a post to a friend who knew João Kepler and tagged him. João Kepler liked the post. It was very cool."* – Uncle of the Valley, Marcio S Galli, https://www.instagram.com/tiodovale

It is inevitable that we want to measure – to observe the results of what we are creating. It may even seem that practical actions are low cost, but in our mind, in our narrative, in the subconscious, you will be connected to it, and it starts to consume you.

The price we pay for increasing our network, our channel, is becoming attached to the narrative that can be fueled by the actions, many of them fragmented, and logically the metrics, such as the total number of followers or a comment from someone special. We become dependent on the narrative as a whole, and it can change our behavior. The more we watch what we sign up for, such as our numbers, the more we believe that our entrepreneurship occurs in that arena, on that stage. But the cost to be paid is not in the possibility of the project's failure if these signals do not resonate with the reality and truths the business or project will face. The cost is in the emotional condition we reach when we face disappointment or when, despite the peaks of dopamine and excitement, we are still pursuing the larger goal that is not resolved day by day. With this, we can find ourselves cornered, or letting time pass, without considering another environment and believing that environment is real.

In defense of another category that posts occasionally without much dedication, a note is worth mentioning. In practice, perhaps many of us do not dedicate specific time to social media posts. It's something light, we do it occasionally like "Look, my company is more than this, I just post and it doesn't even wear us out." But consider the cost to be paid when taking this path, once the individual(s) position themselves in defense, at face value. Who could hold responsibility for something done in free time or in strategic time slots? As if saying, "Oh, it's just some posts I do occasionally." We don't stop to consider that much of what we do, such as things in free time and escapes from time, can actually be things we expect a lot from. It is not logically and well-defined charges, but it consumes silently. And this is exactly the addiction game that Mark Leary suggests. For example, when a person goes there and makes another post believing that perhaps one of them will be a winning post. On one hand, it suggests a construction narrative, without major losses. On the other, it is treading a behavior and a dependence. The focus pays the price. A basic recommendation, if one day you think about "posting occasionally" as an unofficial activity; consider turning this into an official activity. Consider that everything you do for your business should be accounted for during working hours, and you should be responsible and evaluate and judge it in front of your goals.

#### Navigating the System Game

In their pursuit of growth, entrepreneurs may find themselves in a chase for validation, attempting to control - not to say manipulate - the interaction in ways that supports the project development by acceptance from the outside world. Paul Graham, in his talk *Before the Startup with Paul Graham* (How to Start a Startup 2014: Lecture 3), had alerted a whole class of generally young founders to the risk of that instinctive movement: 

> *"[...] Starting a statup is where gaming the system stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. [...] Giving the impression of productivity by sending emails late at night. [...] But in startups, that does not work. [...] There is no boss to trick. There's no, how can you trick people if there's no one to trick? There's only users. [...] You can't, like, wave a red flag at a shark and fool it, it's like, meat or no meat. So, you have to have something people want. [...] And you only prosper to the extend that you do. The dangerous thing is, particularly for you guys, the dangerous thing is that faking does work to some extent with investors. You, if you're really good at knowing what you're talking about. You can fool investors for one, maybe two rounds of funding. But it's not in your interest to. I mean, you're all doing this for equity. You're playing a confidence trick on yourself. You're wasting your own time. *" Paul Graham (2014, Y Combinator: The Vault)

Charman (2015), in his article *The difference between Bootcamps, Incubators and Accelerators,* raises the question about not only of the self movement of entrepreneurs into the possibility of gaming the system, but also of themselves to be induced by the very systems meant to support them, i.e. accelerators, incubators, and bootcamps. He states: "We see more and more people self-qualifying their own personal achievements, and using these to drive their business and their media behind it." This observation raises an important consideration - that there is to some extent that instinctive game the system possibility - such as the one that Paul Graham might have suggested which likely has origins in universities as known so far - but there is also some other systems of acceleration that might be in fact inducing, to some extent, the possibility of setting the team to seek the results such as in a hurry, which may take the team to not even realize it the necessary conscious view for it. The social system in which we might be navigating cam be in away a probing system - not to say a game - in itself that can confuse us. The systems, supposedly the projection of real life, nevertheless an environment such as percepived by the interactions with social media, may not reflect the actual reality towards your goal.

#### The Mirage of Validation


Andrew Chen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, highlights the well-discussed pattern called the *Trough of Sorrow*, where startups face challenging times after launch efforts with external audiences. In his article, *After the TechCrunch bump: Life in the “Trough of Sorrow"* [^footnote_andrewchen_trough], he first describes the pattern where many founders launch their projects, living through a phase of excitement but one which is followed by a setback - where things are not excited - where the actual work could happen, could start, when an actual slower learning and development phase may happen (a potential opportunity) given that the team can support that long journey. But the point of these investors and practitioners spreading the world about this pattern-curve that looks like a rollercoaser, not a fun one tough, is really a revelation to founders of something that somehow they miss or may enter the path not knowing it. The situational, inescapable, it how consistent founders and teams fall, as in to be taken by strong emotions. He is givin a hand to founders as in "wait, this is normal" or "folks, that wasn't a real product" or "people, things are hard" or "team, don't fight much" or "founder, think twice before quit." 

[^footnote_andrewchen_trough]: In *After the TechCrunch bump: Life in the “Trough of Sorrow"*, Andrew Chen, partner-investor at A16Z, had reflected about a pattern which was discussed with Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, and others colleagues, a pattern that shows a struggle that founders live through as they launch their early "products."

The revelation, from the revealed pattern, not directly stated in the article perhaps due to obvious reasons, can't anyway be missed since the title carries *TechCrunch* [^footnote_techcrunch] in it. In other words, the phenomenon observed cannot be disconnected from the prior movement of them telling stories, in the media, about their "hot new products." Stories from these "hot founders." Andrew too reminds them of that, that "working on press mentions, conferences, etc," is not enough [^footnote_andrew_press]. What is inescapable is: how can these founders be induced into the track of publishing that is about getting news and publications without knowing that the movement from audiences is not really totally real? Why do they miss the nuanced observation, the meta-analysis of what will happen? Why the pattern is real? They do want to interact in cheaper ways? They know that. Are they into a path for improving things, for learning, perhaps pivoting? They know it too. But into that, why is it that when the limelights sets in, they fall into that trap movement as if they got famous and as if their brands or product were real? In other words, they fell into creating a narrative for themselves. How much of that is signal or noise? They generally aren't prepared for that. The fact that excitement takes them to high places, the their down movement to a place of sorrow, reveals that they aren't really in control, that they were essentially controlling and becoming a team-being that are to a certain extent obsessively using that PR-like movement as a self-validation, to be right. Which likely sets them out of their creative and flexible condition. That is why consequences like the considerations to quit become real.
