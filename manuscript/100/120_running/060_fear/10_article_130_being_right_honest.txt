### Being right (vs. being honest)







<!--
@outline - ax.x - Being right, standing, not outstanding - Critic that is blocking; frightened of being wrong; (Feat. Julia Cameron, Feat. Sir Ken Robinson)
--> 


The subject in this section considers how entrepreneurs are pressured in ways to be blocked, as they feel a need to do things right. While it may work in some circumstances, we may take that ship to interesting places, yet it may be so that something in the core of ourselves builds up, as in an internal mutilation happening that make us appear to be right, to be integer, while standing, not outstanding. 

No one doing entrepreneurship expects a bad outcome, as in a product that fails, a service that is not welcomed, a solution that is poor. We all expect the best, noone doubts that - it's inescapable. And it also makes a lot of sense to not be arbitrary, although we understand the importance of zooming out to access a wider view before converging, polishing, concretizing.

A challenge, though, comes our way which comes from something great we learned as humans, something that we discussed too in the prior section; that as we do, as we run, as we follow duty of the calling, we do in a way by playing nice with our audiences. In other words, we might be operating with our specialist first, being safe, pleasing as well, expecting the best of course. Thus, we want to advance, we have aspiring goals, and we know too that the path is uncertain, that path of growth for the startup and for ourselves. But we want to do it with a degree of caution, by moving with an approval system, in a way going back to the leg of our mother, the entrepreneurial mother. We constantly may be asking her permission. By trying to do it right, we may get into places that we may not even desire too, such as to places we don't want to be, places we find ourselves lacking movement, lacking creativity, lacking energy, to be bored, to not find value or meaning for ourselves or with our audiences. 



> *"They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities."* Sir Ken Robinson (TED Conferences, 2006)

To not be meaningful which is not different from a writer trying to reach a good writer by first trying to write in the right ways. Point from Julia Cameron that what "we learn in school" has to do with a prose "that actually bores a lot of us out of writing". The thinking pushes us, according to her, "If you can't say anything nice - or nicely - don't say anything at all". That, according to Julia, is what we were taught. Yes, it damages us. For writing, she urges us to move out of that thinking, and mindset, or frameset. She suggests, towars what she believes is the enligthening way of supporting oneself towards *The Right to Write*,  to engage in a new way of doing it, "if only we could give ourselves permission to write 'badly,' so many of us would write very well indeed. "

Let us deepen this discussion, first by relating the entrepreneurial journey to writing, where the focus on being 'right' can lead to outcomes that are technically correct but lack soul or engagement. Next we will reflect that the key is to open up a conscious and creative pace of running; and we shall conclude reflecting that the critic will always come anyway, but that it can be a friendly one, not an enemy.
