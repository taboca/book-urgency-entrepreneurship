### On the right side of a bad road

@outline - ax.x - Being right, standing, not outstanding - Critic that is blocking; frightened of being wrong; (Feat. Julia Cameron, Feat. Sir Ken Robinson)
--> 


No one expects a bad outcome, a product that fails, a service that is not welcomed and likely us to become doers unable to do it. We expect the best - it's an inescapable truth when we are navigating that ocean of entrepreneurship. In this journey, as captains, we know it can't be arbitrary. That's why we trust the ship, we trust our tools, our maps, and our fellow sailor-colleagues that joined the boat. In this journey, in expecting the "land ho!" We accept the storms, the challenges of the open sea, and accept acceptable losses. What we don't accept, as captains, is to abandon the ship. Even when everything changes, on the way, when parts of our ship are mutilated, our duty is to set the pieces, back to the places, to keep the ship integral, in its duty, mainly to navigate the ocean.

Another characterization of these roles is that they are likely unable to revisit their methods, their views, especially in the circumstances or major changes, as in a 10x storm which they never shaw. That is plausible by the very nature of their situation because if they don't honor the procedures, the right ways of doing so, they are out of business, either by the incidents of the nature - straight to the bottom of the sea - or by attackers, or by their central courts. There are just too many layers given by whoever is on board, and by the tools and setting of the local environment, and by the outer environment and the social capital that invested in the ship and journey. 

Although these ships, and their captains, are in a journey for discovery, they're in the first place in a journey for doing the right ways, being specialists in the first place.  If on one hand this is a highly productive setup for navigating, on the other hand, it also sets a challenging setup if for any reason they are confronted with a need to change. The evident aspect of this setup is that it's a result of a prior school. In other words, they were educated and are frightened of being wrong, they're frightened of being drifters, of being arbitrary, of wasting time and wasting resources. Sir Ken Robinson, in *Do schools kill creativity?" had reminds us of our young, aspiring captain, before we get educated: 

> *"They're not frightened of being wrong. [...] What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities."* Sir Ken Robinson (TED Conferences, 2006)

The job of us as captain then sets us into that situation, no matter if we are navigating into art, or writing, or a startup. The young artist, the young writer, the young founder, they all are quite educated into being right. According to Julia Cameron, the traditional school and what "we learn in school," asks us to march into a mode of being right, as in, "if you can't say anything nice - or nicely - don't say anything at all." 

For now, we shall celebrate the phone call that she received from a writer that could not get it right and could not understand what was going on with her writing or herself: 

> *"I got a phone call from Caroline, a young writer finishing her college degree. Caroline is a feisty writer whose prose snorts with spirit. She's witty, pointed, poignant - but not this time. 'I'm writing a paper and it's miserable,' she wailed. 'Can I read you some of it?'
> 'All right, a little,' I reluctantly agreed. Who wants to hear something 'miserable'? Caroline began reading. Her sentences marched like dutiful soldiers. There was no fire, no passion, nothing but duty, duty, duty running across the line. It was 'good' writing at its worst."* (Cameron, Julia, 1998, p.23)

Julia's point, throughout the right to write, is an enlightening reminder and a warning call, that the movement we are set by our schools sets us to write in the correct ways although doesn't take us to write interesting things. But more than that, as we march, it brings us to distance from our true selves which can take us to a situation "that actually bores a lot of us out of writing" (1998, p.23). She urges us to move out of that thinking, that mindset. And she provoke us, to consider the very "permission to write 'badly.'" and the possibilities of that taking us to write interesting things, if not very well.
