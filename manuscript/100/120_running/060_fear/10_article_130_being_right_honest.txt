### Being right (vs. being honest)




<!--
@outline - ax.x - Being right, standing, not outstanding - Critic that is blocking; frightened of being wrong; (Feat. Julia Cameron, Feat. Sir Ken Robinson)
--> 


No one expects a bad outcome, as in a product that fails, a service that is not welcomed, a solution that is poor. We expect the best - it's an inescapable truth when we are navigating that ocean of entrepreneurship. We aren't in it to be arbitrary on our way too - we are captains. Thus we trust the ship, we trust the equipment, and our collegues, our fellow sailors. Our faithful path expects the "land ho!". Yes, we accepts losses, storms, and battles with other ships or pirates. What we don't accept, as captains, is to abandon the ship, even if the whole ship crew seems different, even if all the wooden pieces were replaced, even mutilated, we hold the ship together as if it is integer. 

From our so wanted need for the right moves, our drive to conquer, a challenge sets in from that position of captains, the one that sets in the minute we set our foot aboard. Although we recognize the perils of the open sea, we aren't ready to revisit our methods, ourselves as captains. What looks like doing right continues to flow. And even when the pressure is high, when the winds change, we continue to see all that come to us with our same spyglasses. The challenge, the complication, comes a step before, from the land. From the schools we came, from the world that had educated ourselves, the world that prepare us to be frightened of being wrong and therefore which also take us drift from the possibility of change, of transformation, which may be required when the winds change, when the uncertain environment asks us to become somebody else. Sir Ken Robinson, in *Do schools kill creativity?" had reminds us of our young, aspiring captain, before we get educated: 

> *"They're not frightened of being wrong. [...] What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities."* Sir Ken Robinson (TED Conferences, 2006)

The job of us as captain then sets us into that situation, no matter if we are navigating into art, or writing, or a startup. The young artist, the young writer, the young founder, they all are quite educated into being right. According to Julia Cameron, what "we learn in school" has to do with a prose "that actually bores a lot of us out of writing". She is refering to the real writing, or colorful writing, or eloquent writing, to something that not many writers get there. The trouble-thinking pushes us, according to her, into that mode of being so right that "If you can't say anything nice - or nicely - don't say anything at all". That is what we are taught, and she thinks that it damages us. It take us to writing right things that aren't interesting, although written in propoer ways. For writers, she urges them to move out of that thinking, that mindset. She suggests an enligthening way in *The Right to Write*, to engage, or to recover, or to face, that "if only we could give ourselves permission to write 'badly,' so many of us would write very well indeed. " If we are not prepared of being wrong, we won't get into original places. 

Let us deepen this discussion, first by relating the entrepreneurial journey to writing, where the focus on being 'right' can lead to outcomes that are technically correct but lack soul or engagement. Next we will reflect that the key is to open up a conscious and creative pace of running; and we shall conclude reflecting that the critic will always come anyway, but that it can be a friendly one, not an enemy.
