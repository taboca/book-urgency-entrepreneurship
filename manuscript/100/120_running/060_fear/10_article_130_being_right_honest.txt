### On the right side of a bad road

@outline - ax.x - Being right, standing, not outstanding - Critic that is blocking; frightened of being wrong; (Feat. Julia Cameron, Feat. Sir Ken Robinson)
--> 


No one expects a bad outcome, a product that fails, a service that is not welcomed and likely us to become doers unable to do it. We expect the best - it's an inescapable truth when we are navigating that ocean of entrepreneurship. In this journey, as captains, we know it can't be arbitrary. That's why we trust the ship, we trust our tools, our maps, and our fellow sailor-colleagues that joined the boat. In this journey, in expecting the "land ho!" We accept the storms, the challenges of the open sea, and accept acceptable losses. What we don't accept, as captains, is to abandon the ship. Even when everything changes, on the way, when parts of our ship are mutilated, our duty is to set the pieces, back to the places, to keep the ship integral, in its duty, mainly to navigate the ocean.

It's undeniable, the truth that took so many captains to "discover" lands, which they took as their lands; even though in many circumstances they found quite arbitrary lands. That they are unable to revisit their methods, to see from perspective. And it may be plausible by the very nature of their situation. Because if they don't honor the procedures, the right way of doing so, they would be out, either by the nature to the bottom of the ocean, or by their courts, out of business. What's challenging and not so different, if looking from above, is the a complication for the journey of discovery, such as founders navigating their startups - the journey before the journey - our schools. 

From the schools come from, from the world that had educated ourselves, the world that prepare us to be frightened of being wrong and therefore which also take us drift from the possibility of change, of transformation, which may be required when the winds change, when the uncertain environment asks us to become somebody else. Sir Ken Robinson, in *Do schools kill creativity?" had reminds us of our young, aspiring captain, before we get educated: 

> *"They're not frightened of being wrong. [...] What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities."* Sir Ken Robinson (TED Conferences, 2006)

The job of us as captain then sets us into that situation, no matter if we are navigating into art, or writing, or a startup. The young artist, the young writer, the young founder, they all are quite educated into being right. According to Julia Cameron, the traditional school and what "we learn in school," asks us to march into a mode of being right, as in, "if you can't say anything nice - or nicely - don't say anything at all." We will soon consider the major complication from that movement, and how "that actually bores a lot of us out of writing" (Cameron, 1998, p.23). For now, we can celebrate the phone call she got of a writer that could not really understand what were going on with her writing: 

> *"I got a phone call from Caroline, a young writer finishing her college degree. Caroline is a feisty writer whose prose snorts with spirit. She's witty, pointed, poignant - but not this time. 'I'm writing a paper and it's miserable,' she wailed. 'Can I read you some of it?'
> 'All right, a little,' I reluctantly agreed. Who wants to hear something 'miserable'? Caroline began reading. Her sentences marched like dutiful soldiers. There was no fire, no passion, nothing but duty, duty, duty running across the line. It was 'good' writing at its worst."* (Cameron, Julia, 1998, p.23)

That is what we are taught, and it may serve for certain things in life, but Julia's point throughout the *The Right to Write* is really to warn us as for how that movement, although taking us to write correct, does not take us to write interesting things. She urges us to move out of that thinking, that mindset. And she provoke us, to consider the very "permission to write 'badly.'" and the possibilities of that taking us to write interesting things, if not very well. Julia sets writers to be prepared to being wrong as a fair to escape the traps of being right.
