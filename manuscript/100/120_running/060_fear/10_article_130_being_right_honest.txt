### On the right side of a bad road






To recapitulate, we have just considered two kinds of fears driving a movement. First, celebrating a language of action following a narrative where fears may set us to run from failure. This one I had called it as pre-cooked fear. Then, we have considered another kind, that raw fear kind, inspired by thoughts from Doug Leone, where one might be open to think through, perhaps to consider strategies, but not so fast as the cooked version. If these are kinds of fears driving a movement, we may then turn to perspectives where fear which set us into a defensive position, which in the fast-paced world may not even look defensive since the rich world can too offers fast-paced ways to do nothing, or worse, to move into what seems right. 

No one expects a bad outcome, a product that fails, a service that is not welcomed and likely us to become doers unable to do it. We expect the best - it's an inescapable truth when we are navigating that ocean of entrepreneurship. In this journey, as captains, we know it can't be arbitrary. That's why we trust the ship, we trust our tools, our maps, and our fellow sailor-colleagues that joined the boat. In this journey, in expecting the "land ho!" We accept the storms, the challenges of the open sea, and accept acceptable losses. What we don't accept, as captains, is to abandon the ship. Even when everything changes, on the way, when parts of our ship are mutilated, our duty is to set the pieces, back to the places, to keep the ship integral, in its duty, mainly to navigate the ocean.

Another characterization of these roles is that they are likely unable to revisit their methods, their views, especially in the circumstances or major changes, as in a 10x storm which they never shaw. That is plausible by the very nature of their situation because if they don't honor the procedures, the right ways of doing so, they are out of business, either by the incidents of the nature - straight to the bottom of the sea - or by attackers, or by their central courts. There are just too many layers given by whoever is on board, and by the tools and setting of the local environment, and by the outer environment and the social capital that invested in the ship and journey. 

Although these ships, and their captains, are in a journey for discovery, they're in the first place in a journey for doing the right ways, being specialists in the first place.  If on one hand this is a highly productive setup for navigating, on the other hand, it also sets a challenging setup if for any reason they are confronted with a need to change. The evident aspect of this setup is that it's a result of a prior school. In other words, they were educated and are frightened of being wrong, they're frightened of being drifters, of being arbitrary, of wasting time and wasting resources. Sir Ken Robinson, in *Do schools kill creativity?" had reminds us of our young, aspiring captain, before we get educated: 

> *"They're not frightened of being wrong. [...] What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities."* Sir Ken Robinson (TED Conferences, 2006)

The job of us as captain then sets us into that situation, no matter if we are navigating into art, or writing, or a startup. The young artist, the young writer, the young founder, they all are quite educated into being right. According to Julia Cameron, the traditional school and what "we learn in school," asks us to march into a mode of being right, as in, "if you can't say anything nice - or nicely - don't say anything at all." 

For now, we shall celebrate the phone call that she received from a writer that could not get it right and could not understand what was going on with her writing or herself: 

> *"I got a phone call from Caroline, a young writer finishing her college degree. Caroline is a feisty writer whose prose snorts with spirit. She's witty, pointed, poignant - but not this time. 'I'm writing a paper and it's miserable,' she wailed. 'Can I read you some of it?'
> 'All right, a little,' I reluctantly agreed. Who wants to hear something 'miserable'? Caroline began reading. Her sentences marched like dutiful soldiers. There was no fire, no passion, nothing but duty, duty, duty running across the line. It was 'good' writing at its worst."* (Cameron, Julia, 1998, p.23)

Julia's point, throughout the right to write, is an enlightening reminder and a warning call, that the movement we are set by our schools sets us to write in the correct ways although doesn't take us to write interesting things. But more than that, as we march, it brings us to distance from our true selves which can take us to a situation "that actually bores a lot of us out of writing" (1998, p.23). She urges us to move out of that thinking, that mindset. And she provoke us, to consider the very "permission to write 'badly.'" and the possibilities of that taking us to write interesting things, if not very well.

Julia sets writers to be prepared to being wrong as a way to escape the traps of being right. Now, if we consider the meaning of preparing to being wrong as a way to escape the traps of being right, we will inevitably set ourselves into the struggle of balance, inescapably dealing with questions such as what's the right way for growth. Even if there is permission, it would certainly set us to deal with our critics, the criticism of failing, the criticism of lacking responsibility, criticism of being arbitrary, and the like.

But right there, at that very moment, if thinking or struggling and considering the non-productive possibilities from that possibility, we are very likely missing the point from Julia, that it has more to do with how and when that actual presence of that know-it-all critic gets in the way. That in many situations we are simply unable to perform wth a more flexible mindset as we set our critics on our shoulders, so that in realtime they keep telling us mainly what not to do, and by doing so influence our what to do. And likely, the accumulated tension of non-productivity in the name of productivity. 

This is not different in the entrepreneurial life or the writer's life. We are mainly proudly educated and we carry on a critic on our shoulders. Founders, like captains, carry on too a responsibility to operationalize things, in the first place. They're being somebody in the first place and producing in the first place. Navigating the world, the environment, as they have discussed; with the support from their social environment, as we have discussed, and in many ways wearing an identity, one mainly succeed. Perhaps we are not too different from those captains back in the 1500s, reading and writing letters from and to their kings. As founders we do it too, we read and write letters, to our kings - these can arbitrarily be parents, investors, mentors, and entities and roles within what we see as a supporting system of growth, which may also be characterized, but not limited to, accelerators, incubators, investors, customers, tools, systems, playbooks, plus AI mentors are too coming our way.

The author Dov Seidman, in *How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything*, introduces the concept of the *Valley of Confusion* which describes the "paths" people go through when they face challenges. He compares people who get a "B" grade with those who get an "A" and those who get a "C". The curve that many do is that in their attempt to go from "B" to "A" they end up falling into the "C" grade. This space in the middle is a confusing zone that indeed many get lost.

This is everywhere and it is observable, especially if eventually you get to the space which is easier to take lessons in retrospect about what had happened before. In retrospect, I didn't have trouble to identify elements of that situation from my own journey trying to write this book, likely a C-space throughout the middle years before the work towards completing the book took off. In 2017, when learning the blitzscaling lectures, I had a target - doing things right. I knew that I had an idea of a B-book, of course in a route to make it an A-book. That was sort of my good goal. Not knowing at the time, following the plan of being right, I brought myself into that C space. The observable effects of that space of confusion involved sporadically moments of work, giving up, trying again, letting time pass, days, weeks, months. I was productive in terms of too many moments of interruption or acts that procrastination. But the worst, an accumulated debit, really had to do with a growing frustration which was not clear at the time - of one being bored from that space of confusion, perhaps distancing myself from true writing, not being happy. 

Running the risk of this moment of recounting to sound like that I were on to a hero's journey, a special encounter with a guide on my way made a big difference. Yes, the same Julia Cameron, who is a conductor to the perspectives in this section. Throughout her books, *The Artist's Way*, I was conducted into *The Right to Write* which led me to other books (and guides) like *Becoming a Writer* of Dorothea Brande. That moment, an inflection point, was big because she gave me permission to write in ways which would be wrong using my prior goggles; so I were a bad writer, or writing badly, but essentially respecting myself with an allowance to write. After not trying to sound right to the eyes of a critic (one I mainly had invented) I had started to recover myself, to discover myself, to engage as a writer, to move towards a voice. The permission to make mistakes unleashed a new kind of flow. It brought me to places, to write more like a human, places that would be impossible if I didn't change that prior mindset. 

I'll give you a particular window into how that critic were attacking me into that C space. One special passage happened when I approached about 300 pages, because I felt that the total number of pages had to be around 300. When mentioning to colleagues, I got a positive feedback that it seemed correct to be monitoring. Anyway, having set my market-driven critic in the next seat, I continued to run after 300 miles into that road of confusion. I was partially blocked, partially not blocked, accelerating and braking and stopping. Hey, stop here. No, turn there. Watch out - this is tailgating. What is tailgating? Now you have to do a full stop my friend. Oh, I think I just missed that exit. Watch out. No, wait. This is good, wait. It seems that we drove for too many hours, by now. Oh, shit, the tank is empty. We should fill our tank. Oh, nice, there's an alcohol station right there. That kind of attack was happening at the level of sections, of paragraphs, and even words. But take aside these observable effects, there's something else going on within that car - a major movement inside, at the core. In the inside, I was not enjoying to be a writer that way. Not enjoying at all. Circling, fighting, wasting energy. It was pressure from inside, two people talking at the same time. So chaotic that one would I think that that situation would, perhaps, cause a major destruction. No, it had caused the destruction that creating an illusion that I would engage with work (don't want to say writing) like that. The destruction was evident by some of the pauses in the pitstop where you just don't feel you want to drive again. You can't even tell why. 

Having accepted to not care about the number of pages, anyway for a while, I had witnessed how the process took off. I passed the 400 mark, 500 mark and 600 mark, not counting the pages coming in and out, everyday, extra rides. I was making nice curves and flowing. I even thought I saw that critic in the pitstop waving a headset in his hands. He was trying to say something. I felt a productive traction, ideas that started to make sense. But more than that, I wasn't angry. I had joy next to me. And when I eventually stopped in the pitstop, of course looking at the whole situation and the marks by the characters left behind, it indeed seemed to be a little crazy and out of control. I felt a bit embarrassed, in a way, as in "oops, I did it again," or oops, excuse me. But somehow a thought came in, from the confidence I felt, that I could fix things later. Or that someone else could. And as far as fixing were concerned, fixing the mess left the road, and as far as the number of pages were concerned, I recall the growing of a movement from confidence and from clarity. That movement was a call for a friendly editing and a force to fix and even remove paragraphs, and sections. It was a conscious understanding that I arrived at a place that I could leave certain things behind. So I started first doing it with sections, up to a day that I recall removing about 5 chapters, the book went from 600 pages to 480 in an afternoon. And I tell you that this wasn't about driving under the influence. Now if you ask how I was able to delete many chapters at once? The answer is that, given the considerations so far given, I have used it that backspace key. The very backspace key, now being used to delete whole sections, or an entire chapters, instead of being used in realtime fashion to delete characters within the context of words being typed, or sentences. 

Now if I were challenged to set up a boat for the journey and reconcile the theme of fears, I would certainly invite Doug Leone and Julia Cameron and Sir Ken Robinson as they will be reminding us in enlightening ways that our drive to be right, to being right may connect with an actual denial and the fear of failure voiced by the real time and know-it-all critics that we create to ourselves to justify doing the way we do. But that nevertheless damages our ways, that bores us out from craft. 


In closing our thoughts for this section and yet thinking about grades, I ask us to celebrate an ideal grading scenario that Doug Leone had shown to explain the culture style that seeds Sequoia Capital and sets them apart from other investment firms: 

> *"We have a culture of taking risks. I prefer you take a shot. I’d rather have someone who gets A, F, F, A than someone that gets B+, B+, B+, B+. I prefer people who ask for forgiveness rather than for permission. You have to be willing to put yourself out of business by trying new things, before someone else does.*" (Leone, 2022)
