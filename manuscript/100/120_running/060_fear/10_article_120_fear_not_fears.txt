* Doug Leone talking about fears is massging how to solve the problem, he is allowing himself. To know - of the fears? what you are afraid - may explain Doug's point "The adult human being is far more subtle and concealed about his anxieties and fears. If they do not overwhelm him altogether, he is very apt to repress them, to deny even to himself that they exist. Frequently he does not know that he is afraid." p. 61 

* Note - On fears -> anxiety -> is a prompt - "There are many ways of coping with such anxieties and some of these are cognitive. To such a person, the unfamiliar, the vaguely perceived, the mysterious, the hidden, the unexpected are all apt to the threatening. One way of rendering them familiar, predictable, manageable, controllable, i.e., frightening and harmless is to know them and to understand them. And so, knowledge may have not only a growing forward function, but also an anxiety reduction function, a protective homeostatic function." p.61 of Toward the Psychology of Being 

* Note - Inertia of success, from Andy Grove in Only the Paranoid Survive, connects, perhaps, with the point from Doug, the realization that the meta movement, leading to acceptance of a principle. A reference is the quote from Andy Grove - "Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to live with their strengths. So it's not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers - especially during their 'championship season.' I call this phenomenon the inertia of success. It is extremely dangerous and it can reinforce denial." Andy Grove, Only the Paranoid Survive, The Inertia of Success, p. 127

The italian-born Doug Leone is a successful investor and general partner of Sequoia Capital, a top-tier venture capital firm in Silicon Valley that invested in startups such as Apple, Google, PayPal, Oracle, Yahoo!, Instagram, Oracle, Yahoo!, YouTube, Airbnb, Whatsapp, LinkedIn, and many others. Visinting Doug's wikipedia page, and noticing that he was born in the 4th of July, that in 2017 "Forbes named him as the top-10 investor in the technology industry in the United States," and that in 2021 he "was conferred with the Order of the Star of Italy," it made me think of him as a king, on top of the food-chain, which goes along with his last name, Leone. But can a lion fear something? This one does. Doug said that "raw fear" is the thing that motivates him, to keep going, to keep growing, when he was asked precisely "how do you stay hungry when you get some degree of success?" 

> *"It's not something I do consciously. [...] But to me is just raw, raw fear. I remember walking in the Stanford Mall in 1988, making 67 thousand dollars and not really having enough money to buy presents. I remember those days, and they didn't feel very good, so I have this. I still have this fear that I'm going to be poor. I still have this fear that they're going to throw me out of Sequoia Capital. I still have this fear that I'm gonna, really mess up a founder. I have a great fear, you know, I've been on thirty boards and I have to admit, I messed up one company really good. Now, thankfully, I helped a whole bunch of others, but I fear that I have a huge sense of responsibility. I think fear would be, would be my number one thing. And it's not something I do, it's not a little game I play with myself, I actually, it kind of really gets me going. And, and, it drives me."* Doug Leone (Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2014, 45:20)

That raw fear, put in a way like a force for growth, seems like a more grown up version of that fear that make us run. As in a fear that make him to be calmer, as in that he fears his own roars. His mechanism is one that sets him to kill his self lion, and to embrace the circle of life by reminding his younger one that he is more than what he had become. He is reminding his very self son that the responsibility to become the true king is rooted in the respect for his ancestors and the future generation. But another thing is right there, that he had given to us, the recording, the recounting, his testimony and his honesty; meaning that we had a window into his process of growing as a human and as an investor. That expression is part of his process. He is talking about his fears, that is, he is breaking things down.

For Maslow, what is ahead, after us being triggered by a fear, is generally two options: to know or not to know. Although our willingness to talk about our fears is not a predictor for one or the other movement, into growth or to being defensive, it is a primary element for reflection anyway. In this regard, he celebrates the role of therapists who help people face their resistances as work essentially helping them to bear the truth (2011, p. 57). In this context, he quoted Freud, "To be completely honest with oneself is the very best effort a human being can make."

Thus, if to know or not to know is the next step after being fearful, then talking about fears might be a door to it, and it may also help reduce our anxieties. When Doug framed, in retrospect, raw fear as an element, and recounted potential outcomes of inaction — e.g., messing up a founder, being ousted from Sequoia Capital — these are likely shortcut reminders. He is projecting the tiger that can bring a whole bunch of outcomes if he does not engage his lion. Thank you, Mr. Leone.

The entrepreneur that embraces their fears, which allow the conflict and asks for help, is one that engages into the collaboration process; which is a big idea in the sense that it has to do with allowance for a wider view, a different perspective, which opens the door for an actual wiser view about the entrepreneurship, as opposed to be constrained living an identity, a role, that continues to operate using the same goggles and refusing to see it from different views.
