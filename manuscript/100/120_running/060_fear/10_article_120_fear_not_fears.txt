* Doug Leone talking about fears is massging how to solve the problem, he is allowing himself. To know - of the fears? what you are afraid - may explain Doug's point "The adult human being is far more subtle and concealed about his anxieties and fears. If they do not overwhelm him altogether, he is very apt to repress them, to deny even to himself that they exist. Frequently he does not know that he is afraid." p. 61 

* Note - On fears -> anxiety -> is a prompt - "There are many ways of coping with such anxieties and some of these are cognitive. To such a person, the unfamiliar, the vaguely perceived, the mysterious, the hidden, the unexpected are all apt to the threatening. One way of rendering them familiar, predictable, manageable, controllable, i.e., frightening and harmless is to know them and to understand them. And so, knowledge may have not only a growing forward function, but also an anxiety reduction function, a protective homeostatic function." p.61 of Toward the Psychology of Being 

* Note - Inertia of success, from Andy Grove in Only the Paranoid Survive, connects, perhaps, with the point from Doug, the realization that the meta movement, leading to acceptance of a principle. A reference is the quote from Andy Grove - "Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to live with their strengths. So it's not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers - especially during their 'championship season.' I call this phenomenon the inertia of success. It is extremely dangerous and it can reinforce denial." Andy Grove, Only the Paranoid Survive, The Inertia of Success, p. 127

The italian-born Doug Leone is a successful investor and general partner of Sequoia Capital, a top-tier venture capital firm in Silicon Valley that invested in startups such as Apple, Google, PayPal, Oracle, Yahoo!, Instagram, Oracle, Yahoo!, YouTube, Airbnb, Whatsapp, LinkedIn, and many others. Visinting Doug's wikipedia page, and noticing that he was born in the 4th of July, that in 2017 "Forbes named him as the top-10 investor in the technology industry in the United States," and that in 2021 he "was conferred with the Order of the Star of Italy,"it made me think of him as a king, on top of the food-chain, which goes along with his last name, Leone. But can a lion fear something? This one does. Doug said that "raw fear" is the thing that motivates him, to keep going, to keep growing, when he was asked precisely "how do you stay hungry when you get some degree of success?" 

> *"It's not something I do consciously. [...] But to me is just raw, raw fear. I remember walking in the Stanford Mall in 1988, making 67 thousand dollars and not really having enough money to buy presents. I remember those days, and they didn't feel very good, so I have this. I still have this fear that I'm going to be poor. I still have this fear that they're going to throw me out of Sequoia Capital. I still have this fear that I'm gonna, really mess up a founder. I have a great fear, you know, I've been on thirty boards and I have to admit, I messed up one company really good. Now, thankfully, I helped a whole bunch of others, but I fear that I have a huge sense of responsibility. I think fear would be, would be my number one thing. And it's not something I do, it's not a little game I play with myself, I actually, it kind of really gets me going. And, and, it drives me."* Doug Leone (Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2014, 45:20)

Raw fear as a force for growth? It may be, perhaps, a grown up version of that ligth version of fear which make us run. But Leone's approach is not light, it's raw indeed, from that unsetting place perhaps taking him into the struggle, considering a whole bunch of aspects of his position that should be challenged. Doug is embracing the circle of life, killing his own prior lion, or letting it die, and becoming the new king. When he does that, when he looks in the mirror, he wonders between to be or not to be, he reminds himself of his responsibilities. 

So then, right there and given in the interview, through the recording, his recounting, his testimony and and his honesty, we can see a window into his process, for growing, as a human and as an investor. That expression is part of his process. He is talking about his fears, that is, he is breaking things down, he is accessing knowledge. Although raw fear, his process takes him to reduce anxiety by accessing that new Leone.

* [ ] Friends - Jorge Henrique, Jow, helped with the digging bringing that Lion King is Hamlet, that Hamlet becoming Hamlet is a struggle, perhaps to a certain extent, transcending. This gave me support to go dig for understanding that scene of the Lion King (Simba and his father the ghost.) All this goes along with the be and not to be and also a synchronicity point is that English from Britain has changed after USA colonization. https://chatgpt.com/share/cc0f0c63-5cba-44ae-a78a-5d531cd0915d Jow also confirmed that Hamlet speaking with his "father" the scene equivalent to the ghost of father in Lion king is in fact himself speaking.

For Maslow, in *The Need to Know and the Fear of Knowing*, what is ahead after we are triggered by a fear (when anxiety comes up,) are two options: to want to know or not want to know. This idea is contextualized when he identifies the role of therapists as the ones who help people face their resistances - as the ones essentially helping people to bear the truth (2011, p. 57). In this context, he quotes the goal according to Freud, "To be completely honest with oneself is the very best effort a human being can make." 

As Doug recounts his raw fear, and the potential outcomes of inaction - e.g., messing up a founder, being ousted from Sequoia Capital - he is projecting a tiger and a whole bunch of outcomes. He is, in the first place, being honest with himself. And although one's act in being open to talk about fears is not a predictor for one (growth) or the other (defensive) movement, yet we can't miss one's self willingness to create the exposition, and the potential to support in therapeutic ways what comes next. Since Doug consistently opens himself and acknowledge his raw fears, he sets himself in a place to be okay to know, not into the fear of knowing, to some extent in alignment with the growth path as suggested by Maslow: 

> *"There are many ways of coping with such anxieties and some of these are cognitive. To such a person, the unfamiliar, the vaguely perceived, the mysterious, the hidden, the unexpected are all apt to the threatening. One way of rendering them familiar, predictable, manageable, controllable, i.e., frightening and harmless is to know them and to understand them. And so, knowledge may have not only a growing forward function, but also an anxiety reduction function, a protective homeostatic function."*  (Maslow, 2011, p. 61)

Essentially, Doug's atitude takes him to not fear knowing, which takes him to the need to know. In other words, from his self-therapeuthic process goes from being honest, to feel, to know, to learn, thus to become. This is for us an opportunity to celebrate that to be, or not to be, we depends on the to know, or not to know, which comes after we noticing ours fears in the first place. 

The entrepreneur that embraces their fears, which allow that struggle, and asks for help, is one that engages into a collaboration process. This starts as a self-collaboration process in the first place and it is a big idea in the sense that it represents a movement, one step, into what can mean acquiring new perspectives. This is for us an opportunity to celebrate that to be, or not to be, we depends on the to know, or not to know, which comes after we noticing ours fears in the first place.
