* Doug Leone talking about fears is massging how to solve the problem, he is allowing himself. To know - of the fears? what you are afraid - may explain Doug's point "The adult human being is far more subtle and concealed about his anxieties and fears. If they do not overwhelm him altogether, he is very apt to repress them, to deny even to himself that they exist. Frequently he does not know that he is afraid." p. 61 

* Note - On fears -> anxiety -> is a prompt - "There are many ways of coping with such anxieties and some of these are cognitive. To such a person, the unfamiliar, the vaguely perceived, the mysterious, the hidden, the unexpected are all apt to the threatening. One way of rendering them familiar, predictable, manageable, controllable, i.e., frightening and harmless is to know them and to understand them. And so, knowledge may have not only a growing forward function, but also an anxiety reduction function, a protective homeostatic function." p.61 of Toward the Psychology of Being 

* Note - Inertia of success, from Andy Grove in Only the Paranoid Survive, connects, perhaps, with the point from Doug, the realization that the meta movement, leading to acceptance of a principle. A reference is the quote from Andy Grove - "Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to live with their strengths. So it's not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers - especially during their 'championship season.' I call this phenomenon the inertia of success. It is extremely dangerous and it can reinforce denial." Andy Grove, Only the Paranoid Survive, The Inertia of Success, p. 127

The italian-born Doug Leone is a successful investor and general partner of Sequoia Capital, a top-tier venture capital firm in Silicon Valley that invested in startups such as Apple, Google, PayPal, Oracle, Yahoo!, Instagram, Oracle, Yahoo!, YouTube, Airbnb, Whatsapp, LinkedIn, and many others. Visiting his Wikipedia page, I couldn't resist an instinct to see him as a king. Born on the 4th of July, in 2017 Forbes named him as the "top=10 investor in technology in the United States." In 2021, he was conferred with the "Order of the Star of Italy."

In a way, on top of the food-chain, that is Mr. Leone. But can a lion fear something? This one does. Doug said that "raw fear" is the thing that motivates him, to keep going, to keep growing, when he was asked precisely "how do you stay hungry when you get some degree of success?" 

> *"It's not something I do consciously. [...] But to me is just raw, raw fear. I remember walking in the Stanford Mall in 1988, making 67 thousand dollars and not really having enough money to buy presents. I remember those days, and they didn't feel very good, so I have this. I still have this fear that I'm going to be poor. I still have this fear that they're going to throw me out of Sequoia Capital. I still have this fear that I'm gonna, really mess up a founder. I have a great fear, you know, I've been on thirty boards and I have to admit, I messed up one company really good. Now, thankfully, I helped a whole bunch of others, but I fear that I have a huge sense of responsibility. I think fear would be, would be my number one thing. And it's not something I do, it's not a little game I play with myself, I actually, it kind of really gets me going. And, and, it drives me."* Doug Leone (Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2014, 45:20)

Raw fear as a force for growth? If that prior kind, the cooked fear, were a serving for productivity, perhaps halfway setting the what to do, this one is certainly a different kind. One that sets movement as well, but it works at another level, certainly in the strategic ways. Doug certainly knows what it takes, for him and his colleagues, to keep Sequoia as an outstanding investing firm. It demands reinvention from within: 

> *"The old adage that, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it,' does not apply to Sequoia Capital. Itâ€™s the exact opposite. If something is working like a dream, we modify it, we try to break it, because competitors and new entrants will try to find new ways to beat us."*  (Leone, 2017)

Doug's fear sets him into the woods, back to the struggle. It is a place of hard work and he needs to be paranoid as heck to not be trapped by any given, even crystal-clear, views. Doug kills his own lion, letting it go, as a process to become a king again. When he looks in the mirror, and wonder again and again to be or not to be, he reminds himself of that responsibity. Right there, given by his testimony, I ask us to celebrate his honest expression as a vital part in his process. It is by talking about these things, his first movement to try to break the working things, to step toward not being afraid of knowing.

* [ ] Friends - Jorge Henrique, Jow, helped with the digging bringing that Lion King is Hamlet, that Hamlet becoming Hamlet is a struggle, perhaps to a certain extent, transcending. This gave me support to go dig for understanding that scene of the Lion King (Simba and his father the ghost.) All this goes along with the be and not to be and also a synchronicity point is that English from Britain has changed after USA colonization. https://chatgpt.com/share/cc0f0c63-5cba-44ae-a78a-5d531cd0915d Jow also confirmed that Hamlet speaking with his "father" the scene equivalent to the ghost of father in Lion king is in fact himself speaking.

For Maslow, in *The Need to Know and the Fear of Knowing*, fear, and the anxiety that goes along, set us to solve bring back the equilibrium by choosing between two exits: to want to know or to not want to know. This is where a therapist role chimes in, to help people face their resistances, essentially helping them to bear the truth (2011, p. 57). In this context, he quotes the goal according to Freud, "To be completely honest with oneself is the very best effort a human being can make." Although one's self act talking about fears is not a predictor for knowing (growth) or the fearing to know (defensive), yet we shouldn't miss the importance of that prime movement that creates the exposition, that asks for help. It is, nevertheless, a way into the knowing: 

> *"There are many ways of coping with such anxieties and some of these are cognitive. To such a person, the unfamiliar, the vaguely perceived, the mysterious, the hidden, the unexpected are all apt to the threatening. One way of rendering them familiar, predictable, manageable, controllable, i.e., frightening and harmless is to know them and to understand them. And so, knowledge may have not only a growing forward function, but also an anxiety reduction function, a protective homeostatic function."*  (Maslow, 2011, p. 61)

To recapitulate, we have considered two aspects of fears that drive us to move. First, that language of fear which we react in productive ways, apparently anyway, where our movements can generally be instinctive, driven from a knowing from real or projected or subjective threats derived from other higher-order threats [^footnote_higher_order_threats]. This may be, a way like a fear that comes with a knowledge after a post-mortem analysis. On the other hand, we have too considered this raw fear situation, one that may set one into a calling - it may suggest a movement but not so reactive as it may ask us to hold, before action, perhaps more like a pre-mortem exercise where we feel first but enter the path of knowing, not fearing knowledge, essentially being more honest. 

[^footnote_higher_order_threats]: In the timeline of a corporate situation there is always the fear of insolvency, such as of a division to be killed. So in a way or another the idea of one's head on the line will propagate from top to bottom. The use and abuse of the language - or iminent risk or loss or death - is a mechanism we use to get things done.
