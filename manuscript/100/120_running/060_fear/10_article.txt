@outline - subject - Fear make us decide. Fears make us run. We need to acknowledge fear such as fear of knowing.

On the other hand, it is also unfair to think that entrepreneurs don't feel and reflect about their fears. I fear that fear happens in the work day the other way around - that fear is naturally felt in the and it is seamlessly well-administered in the life of founders, their start-ups and even grown-up companies.


Fear might actually affect to move mountains, perhaps grain-by-grain the fast-paced world accumulating amounts of energy, deploying resources, using time, in other words, the fear that appears as a fuel and gives us direction and then the impulse to run, to do things faster. But what we don't generally consider is the possibility of the other kind of fear, the fear that sets us to go back to safety. No matter which condition stage of growth we are in, there's always a kind of fear that appears that may increase anxiety, where we don't want to know, don't want to get there and we rather stick by an unshakable faith within the course and the given perspective.

<!-- 
@note * Fears vs. Faith - was broutht by Marcio. In the introduction, of the section Fears, Marcio has suggested a metaphor, that "fear can move mountains." Then, he objects to it, by saying that, perhaps not, that in fact fear can build faith. Although a bit coherent, this saying were lacking substance, or connection, as if it was metaphorical but not fundamented. But then, when reading Maslow's book "Toward a Psychology of Being," the section Entitled "Need to Know and Fear of Knowing," Maslow refers to a kind of fear that's different from the fear of knowledge, that is a fear of us becoming too great. And it seems to be that such fear is an attack, comes from an attack of the environment, of the superior, that to some, or perhaps a great, extent induces the subordinate to not become like Gods or greater. Maslow indicates that religions and other systems brings a kind of message about the dangers of allowing us to enter the space of knowledge, the dangers of letting us to become curious, the dangers of curiosity, the dangers of being Gods, or geniuses. And he suggests the trace, a preference for things like faith and belief and piety rather than knowledge. Or the feeling that some forms of knowledge were too dangerous to meddle with and had best be forbidden or reserved to a few special people.

@outline - situation - Fear is in us, humans carry, drives survival. It gets into the language. 
--> 

If we set a time machine to somewhere 30000 to 36000 years ago, and find a human on a tree fearing the fearless wolf that paciently waits, we can visualize - and respect - that feeling which improves the chances for survival in the face of the danger. Someone in your ancestors tree feared a similar threat since you are now reading this book, feeling connected with that ancestor, next to your puppy, Wolfie. But back to the future of now, the metaphor that fears move mountains makes sense as decisions in the knowledge economy, especially in the digital landscape, are not disconnected from what we perceive, what we think, and what we feel. The mountain of now can be the pile of resources, such as money, or time. The wolves of now can be the competitor. And your organization is the tree of now, where we can go up and down, and hoping to survive. And we you do so, my hope that we can have the time to reflect, first, and to come down from that tree and paint about that situation-complication, to help ourselves with a reflection and the next generation helping us. 

If some of that sounds far from where we are, I fear that we must confront, or celebrate, or accept, the fact that narratives driven by fear are quite naturally administered into the veins of our corporate body - even to a point where we don't make sense of how our now-networked brain responds. And all of this becomes even more serious given that the startup situation deals with threats as projections, idealized, more than real threats of the present. In other words, because growth is expected and ahead, and risks or prizes are there; it follows an implied element of risk analysis and the potential that larger sums of resources are lined up to be deployed under the expectation that it will support growth to happen. In other words, a lot is based on signals, or perceptions, therefore less related to real threats or iminent risk. 





<!--
@outline - complication - No room to discussion fears, the role of fear, how fears impacts productivity and strategy. But fear is presently influencing anyway, the moving to know more or to not be willing to know. The movement anyway, even to run, when we want to get away from problems. 
--> 





The reason for us to be together celebrating the role of fear, is that the entrepreneurial agenda does not allow room to discuss fears, or the role of fear, or how a language and dynamics oriented to fears is just part of our mechanism to be productive. In other words, fear drives productivity, fear eloquently shapes the narratives that create that affects our decisions. To note, or to narrow our scope and increase the complexity of the situation, the setting of a startup starts with a few people - founders and the small team [^footnote_blitzscaling_family_stage] - which certainly means agility, therefore increased level of authority. In other words, although the mountain of resources is small comparing with a large company, it is bigger in terms of impact to the path, to the future of the startup. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_family_stage]: Within the Blitzscaling lectures, the family stage refers to a small team, and it is stage one. 








<!--
@outline - GA - Running is not the purpose, is getting things done which is to know.

* Note - To get things done, you get to know. We either fear knowing it, to reduce anxiety, or we do not fear knowing it. The mechanism is to cut impulses to the know part, or to boost it. (Highly ingluenced by Maslow's model given in p.63 of Toward a Psychology of Being)

* Note - * Fear vs. knowing which is doing - "In any case, this close relationship between knowing and doing can help us to interpret one cause of the fear of knowing as deeply a fear of doing, a fear of the consequences that flow from knowing, a fear of its dangerous responsibilities. Often it is better not to know, because if you did know, then you would *have* to act and stick your neck out. This is a little involved, a little like the man who said, "I'm so glad I don't like oysters, because if I liked oysters, I'd eat them, and I'd hate the darn things." " Maslow, p.63 
-->






With that, and depending on the circunstances of what is ahead, we know that people can be more or less fearful. And, although we don't generally characterize teams, or divisions, as fearful, we will explore how the constituents turn fears into narratives that are powerful to change directions.If a team member had the courage to put straightforward such as "I am afraid of going in this direction" it would perhaps be a call for a debate. But reality is that fear chimes differently, like a movement in the backstage, such as when a local authority says "I fear that we will be killed by our competition." Therefore, in this chapter, we shall continue to respect fear as an element that pushes the entrepreneur's journey, not only the pace but also the path of innovation. 

We'll start by visualizing how fear appears in the normal, average day of work at the language level, where us doers are either influenced or influencing the face of threats, fearfully driven to run faster, not because of a threat to our lives, but nevertheless to our identities or values we hold in the face of what we want to get done and our needs to grow and succeed. We follow with managerial conversations and perspectives where fear is acknowledged, either at the personal level or managerial discussions, such as in large organizations. We close, not in ways to suppress fear, but to acknowledge, to develop a conscious feel about the narratives and the two modes where fear either boosts to run faster or cut the impulses and keep us defensive.

@outline - Ax.x - Stakes are high, fears are in the language, in the enviroment, even to take us to act.

### The stakes are high, put that coffee down!  



"This [project] will blow up!" Is what I once heard from my manager, shortly after I had entered the meeting room. I think that he feared a dead end, if we didn't act in a different way. Or, perhaps, he feared that weren't doing enough, or that we could put more effort, or do things in a different way, a better way, a faster way. What is interesting - now in retrospect - is that it didn't cross my mind to offer support to him, to elaborate on his fears. Perhaps that inaction was just part of the mood, and context, that we were in at the time. The mood that gave the title of "war room" to the temporary meeting place where most of us had to work for a while - a sacred space for getting things done. From that message, it was unavoidable to see a future where we would not exist, our team, and consequently myself as a worker of that well-known, and respected, Silicon Valley company. Plus, the rent. Plus, myself as an immigrant in US. 

A few years later, back in another office space of another Silicon Valley company, I caught a post-it glued to the keys of my laptop. It had a written message, "Things are not working yet!" Nothing signed. Not written in blood, nothing to be too scary. But I got scared, perhaps from seeing too many movies anyway, I don't know. I know that I couldn't think twice: I picked the post-it and showed to the startup's vice president, which happen to be who hired me. Hey, Bob, see this. The minute he read the note, he immediately said that "this is unacceptable in America!" I won't ever forget the precision of his move, or his motives, his reaction. I think that Robert were, to some extent, intersted in equalizing that situation - that complication - as in within 9 seconds. 24-hours later he told me that he was not anymore working for that company. I don't know if any of that were connected, I don't even know exactly what had happened. Anyway, in retrospect, I think that he feared that the company lacked a more transparent or ethical communication. Or perhaps he feared that the note would decrease my chances to thrive in that organization, to help the organization.  

With these examples, I am not saying that all employees, and management, that everyone follows primarily the dramatic moves given or driven first by fears. But it is undeniable, or primal, when fear chimes in and gives us an unsetting atmosphere one that sets us anyway, that take us, although it can appear in lighter ways or may be the kind of fear that some refer as raw fear. At this stage of reflection, my intent is to position us in the place of respecting that fear in the corporate setting might be present as a beast behind the actual scene. In other words, constituents are able to feel threats from a potentially risky situation which pulls them to come up with a narrative, which can become quite colorful, quite real, and meaningful. In other words, the feeling of a painful outcomes triggers the creative mind to come up with a story, a narrative, or a calling, like tigers, which may prompt us to take a actions, to decide, like to run.

Doug Leone, partner at Sequoia Capital, explains how he keeps himself motivated and out of his comfort zone. He added that "raw fear" is what motivates him. Fear, put in a way like a serious motivational force? There must be something in there. His idea invites us to reflect on fears connected to hopes:

> *"But to me is just raw, raw fear. I remember walking in the Stanford Mall in 1988, making 67 thousand dollars and not really having enough money to buy presents. I remember those days, and they didn't feel very good, so I have this. I still have this fear that I'm going to be poor. I still have this fear that they're going to throw me out of Sequoia Capital. I still have this fear that I'm gonna, really mess up a founder. I have a great fear, you know, I've been on thirty boards and I have to admit, I messed up one company really good. Now, thankfully, I helped a whole bunch of others, but I fear that I have a huge sense of responsibility. I think fear would be, would be my number one thing. And it's not something I do, it's not a little game I play with myself, I actually, it kind of really gets me going. And, and, it drives me."* Doug Leone (Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2014, 45:20)

When listening to Doug's note, I noticed a truth but at the same time a puzzle. How come that in some circumstances, fear sets us to engage with a whole bunch of troubles and do what it takes to face the challenges, including the challenges of changing ourselves? That, instead of that other fear that drives us to inaction, to be defensive? But another truth was there too — right there, visible and materialized by his saying — exactly from that not so typical statement from an investor, a highly qualified one. That he talked about it, that he had given to us, the recording, the recounting, his testimony and his honesty; meaning that we had a window into his process of growing as a human and as an investor. That expression is part of his process. He is talking about his fears, that is, he is breaking things down.

For Maslow, what is ahead, after us being triggered by a fear, is generally two options: to know or not to know. Although our willingness to talk about our fears is not a predictor for one or the other movement, into growth or to being defensive, it is a primary element for reflection anyway. In this regard, he celebrates the role of therapists who help people face their resistances as work essentially helping them to bear the truth (2011, p. 57). In this context, he quoted Freud, "To be completely honest with oneself is the very best effort a human being can make."

Thus, if to know or not to know is the next step after being fearful, then talking about fears might be a door to it, and it may also help reduce our anxieties. When Doug framed, in retrospect, raw fear as an element, and recounted potential outcomes of inaction — e.g., messing up a founder, being ousted from Sequoia Capital — these are likely shortcut reminders. He is projecting the tiger that can bring a whole bunch of outcomes if he does not engage his lion. Thank you, Mr. Leone.

The entrepreneur that embraces their fears, which allow the conflict and asks for help, is one that engages into the collaboration process; which is a big idea in the sense that it has to do with allowance for a wider view, a different perspective, which opens the door for an actual wiser view about the entrepreneurship, as opposed to be constrained living an identity, a role, that continues to operate using the same goggles and refusing to see it from different views.

### From being right to being honest







<!--
@outline - ax.x - Being right, standing, not outstanding - Critic that is blocking; frightened of being wrong; (Feat. Julia Cameron, Feat. Sir Ken Robinson)
--> 


The subject in this section considers how entrepreneurs are pressured in ways to be blocked, as they feel a need to do things right. While it may work in some circumstances, we may take that ship to interesting places, yet it may be so that something in the core of ourselves builds up, as in an internal mutilation happening that make us appear to be right, to be integer, while standing, not outstanding. 

No one doing entrepreneurship expects a bad outcome, as in a product that fails, a service that is not welcomed, a solution that is poor. We all expect the best, noone doubts that - it's inescapable. And it also makes a lot of sense to not be arbitrary, although we understand the importance of zooming out to access a wider view before converging, polishing, concretizing.

A challenge, though, comes our way which comes from something great we learned as humans, something that we discussed too in the prior section; that as we do, as we run, as we follow duty of the calling, we do in a way by playing nice with our audiences. In other words, we might be operating with our specialist first, being safe, pleasing as well, expecting the best of course. Thus, we want to advance, we have aspiring goals, and we know too that the path is uncertain, that path of growth for the startup and for ourselves. But we want to do it with a degree of caution, by moving with an approval system, in a way going back to the leg of our mother, the entrepreneurial mother. We constantly may be asking her permission. By trying to do it right, we may get into places that we may not even desire too, such as to places we don't want to be, places we find ourselves lacking movement, lacking creativity, lacking energy, to be bored, to not find value or meaning for ourselves or with our audiences. 



> *"They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities."* Sir Ken Robinson (TED Conferences, 2006)

To not be meaningful which is not different from a writer trying to reach a good writer by first trying to write in the right ways. Point from Julia Cameron that what "we learn in school" has to do with a prose "that actually bores a lot of us out of writing". The thinking pushes us, according to her, "If you can't say anything nice - or nicely - don't say anything at all". That, according to Julia, is what we were taught. Yes, it damages us. For writing, she urges us to move out of that thinking, and mindset, or frameset. She suggests, towars what she believes is the enligthening way of supporting oneself towards *The Right to Write*,  to engage in a new way of doing it, "if only we could give ourselves permission to write 'badly,' so many of us would write very well indeed. "

Let us deepen this discussion, first by relating the entrepreneurial journey to writing, where the focus on being 'right' can lead to outcomes that are technically correct but lack soul or engagement. Next we will reflect that the key is to open up a conscious and creative pace of running; and we shall conclude reflecting that the critic will always come anyway, but that it can be a friendly one, not an enemy. 






<!--
@outline - startup like a game 
--> 

#### Startup can played, like a game 

Here is where Julia Cameron comes to us again, her contribution set us into the enlighted ways and one that starts with permission. Permission to step into the opportunity path, permission to seek for engagement, for meaning, which may also mean that the path may appear to be wrong. By the way this opportunity path is about stepping into what would be the "bad writing that leads to good writing" or the "bad entrepreneurship of good entrepreneurshp". First, managing the possibility part, is pilar 1, supporting pilar. It's okay and real stories are not made of following the right stones and the "side B" of what it takes to do things matters. We need to grasp that first. That is that. 

Complex because being right, for the startup, may not look different from trying to be right for writing, as in good grammar or trying to write what others want to listen. In the startup situation the being right can be come out differently although the essence connects with being right in the eyes of another audience. And which is one of the criteria for the "right paths"? Following the stones such as the milestones that other successful stories, such as the milestones of success, seeking approaval from customers, from investors, from a process system that is seen as a validating process, sounding right to an advisor, and more. 

It is complex because in the startup situation it may be, for example, that quite exciting things are the actual things that are expected by this external system, an audience which we may want to please. The point is that colorful pathways can be these right pathways, and can be given by frameworks which can be seen as the right way of doing as told by their environment. It may be that the team sets a mat in front of them which in a way tells them where to jump - like a jump to conclusions mat [^footnote_jump_conclusions_mat], one which they can jump to, step into the right spots. 

[^footnote_jump_conclusions_mat]: The "Jump to Conclusions Mat" isn't really a game but a fictional product referred in the movie *Office Space*, to symbolize that humans may come up with systems that are meant to help them; but too that their own systems can also be means for executing and deciding in ways they want, as in to exercise control and not for being used as systems for comprehension. In the game, the player can "jump" to, literally by jumping on different labeled conclusions. The humor and satire of the game serve as a metaphor for the human tendency to jump to conclusions without sufficient evidence or reasoning. This product humorously critiques our often premature or simplistic decision-making processes, reflecting the broader comedic tone of the movie in which it appears.







The author Dov Seidman, in "How" (check page), introduces the concept of the Valley of Difficulty (check the name of the Valley) which describes the "paths" people go through when they face challenges; and he compares people who get a "B" grade with those who get an "A" and those who get a "C". The curve goes from "B" to "A", passing through "C". He points out, citing research (check), that between the "B" grade and the "A" grade there is a valley, a confusing and arduous place where many people get lost and end up stuck in the valley, receiving the "C" grade.

This space in the middle is a confusing zone that indeed demotivates many people, a valley that can be gloomy, in the sense that many get bogged down there. But those who pass through it manage to succumb (rise) and reach a clearer space, the "A" grade.

We all recognize that many things are difficult, because there is this pressure to do better - we are always comparing our work to the external world. So often the "task" to be done, the challenge, becomes nebulous precisely because our reference is the external world - for example, many of the challenges faced by entrepreneurs are guided by metrics, like the idea of being better, faster, cheaper. Often, the pilgrimage in this valley becomes indeed frustrating because it starts with parameters, becomes mediocre, when it is limited to having to differentiate from something that others do, such as competition.

@outline - Controlling creativity, not chaos, but transcending with chaotic possibly 
--> 

#### Controlling creativity 



Maslow See the point? The real point is about trying to control success, which is not the creative mindset. The colorful and likely bad writing of a writer's path is the bad of unknown which, for one that expects to be a writing, the not allowed path. Why? Because it would be boring, too painful, not possible to grab success with that uncertainty.  

It's not about doing the bad and arbitrary and even colorful which is meant for the sake of executing chaos as if chaos means creativity. Or, on the other hand, the right outcome that has not color, the extremmes. These are two faces of operating as in trying to control, a movement that is forced. In this regard, I would like to bring a concrete contribution from Maslow from *Maslow on Management*. When he refers to the creative being, the being that does not control the outcome. But see, the creative is not random too. He or she is just outside the pressure system of trying to control: 

> *"Need to pick the Reference of quotation and page for this Maslow of Management article about the creative person."*

-->

This allowing may set the team into joyful findings, if we put ourselves into the possibility. Thus, this is about having fun too, as a path. A gentlemen which I met in the bus one day asked me to organize the company, the room, without worrying about the outcome, that things would work in the end. I felt something big there as in "do not control". In the releasing control, as an exercise of process, we can find joy too, a calmness. What if we can do that "in the day" as opposed to "in the year" or "in the week" in opposed to "in the month". See, going back to recognizing the axis of the free and creative (not right) versus the controled and right way, we can unleash us into the "moments of relaxation" which may in fact set us into having clear views about the whole thing.  





Investor Paul Graham created another illustration for a different type of valley that also affects entrepreneurs, called the "Valley of Sorrow," shown below.

[Figure of Paul Graham's Valley of Sorrow]

In Paul Graham's version, entrepreneurs launch their products and initially gain some traction—they get media coverage and experience a sort of pre-carnival; but soon they find themselves alone, without users or customers, and no longer appear in the media. They have passed through. In this zone, many give up. Still, in the optimistic narrative, the survivors find themselves on a slow growth curve; and this is Paul Graham's advice for entrepreneurs to focus on learning and gaining real traction with their customers—the trend of "doing things that don't scale," a topic for the next section. [Check which section].

[Check if this article is redundant due to another article somewhere that also talked about Paul Graham's Valley of Sorrow]

But Paul made this forecast, based on experience, observation. Perhaps this version of the valley of sorrow came out with this drawing, this initial curve followed by a valley, a slow and arduous pilgrimage, precisely because at some point the world, the entrepreneurs, began to operate "on the wave" of previous successful models, from others. Paul Graham's valley is very clear on the first mountain.

[Figure of an ascending curve, without the valley; versus the curve with the valley. Showing the initial problem]

It can then be articulated that the problem of the valley, or relevant issue, stems from the initial urgency, in the first place - the intention to launch into the world, perhaps artificially.

#### Grown up blocky situations 




We want to feel emotions, we want to recognize fear, we want to allow ourselves to be vulnerable. These aren't  statements that we generally get busy with, or think of, in the entrepreneurial space or in the corporate arena. It sounds a bit like some touchy-feely issues [^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely], or perhaps things for a therapy session. 

[^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely]: In his book *Only the Paranoid Survive* (1999), Andy Grove discusses, in *Let Chaos Reign*, what he calls *The Touchy-feely Issues*, that in certain situations, particularly those faced by large corporations, managers often react emotionally to crises (p. 123) as business people are humans where their personal growth and emotions are closely tied to the identity and well-being of their business.

So a real complicated question would not even rise here, not normally, not in the work setting in general. We know that the average runner is not talking, or reflective about that, perhaps more foused in the running by the fears that drives the movement, from the threats real or not than to consider the dynamics of themselves when they are more or less fearfull, being more or less anxious, more or less inclined to supress anxiety by either facing acessing knowleldge or living the denial of it and focusing in what is known. 

Let us dig into some well-known reflections about fears, and feelings related to fears such as fear of loss, from mindful doers that went through and witnessed and reflected about the challenging space of humans operating organizations for growth. This will certainly help us to recognize fear in our language, and anxiety that takes over which take us to know more or to deny knowledge, but to value that the theme is valid and it supports our conscious view; that to be aware and to not dismiss the subject as a serious subject. The allowance for disucssions about fears, the conscious discussions about how fears which gets translated into the narratives, is in itself powerful and can be a seed for the culture that is a truth seeking culture, an activity consisting of seeking honesty.  





Andy Grove also shared a similar idea about fears as a force that motivates creativity and action—fear of losing to a competitor, fear that the product is not good enough for customers, and more. 


For Andy, there exists a sequence of emotions that is not too different from those experienced during the loss of loved ones, which can be experienced by people, like leaders in the corporate setting, in the midst of what he called "inflection points." Let us first bring about his definition of an inflection point in the context of a major organization - Intel went through a few of those but the iconic moment was the moment when Intel had to drop its identity from *Being* a memory chip manufacturing to embrace *Becoming* a microprocessor manufacturer. Since Intel survived the inflection point, then we have good thoughts from Andy to reccount. The following passage gives us a view: 

> *""* 

But then, as the major corporation is passing through that, is perhaps a reflection of what a human passes as they need to move from being and into becoming especially when they are challenged, their views, their perspectives, their views about their identities. 

He suggests a parallel between the sequence of losing a loved one and the sequence experienced in the corporate domain during an inflection point. Grove revealed that he wrote one of his books amidst one of these turbulent journeys that Intel went through around the 1980s suggesting that in that situation, he might have been escaping from recognizing the situation? Perhaps?







> *"Business people are not just managers, they are also human. They have emotions and a lot of their emotions are tied up in the identity and well-being of their businesses. If you are a senior manager, you probably got to where you are because you have devoted a large portion of your life to your trade, to your industry and to your company. In many instances, your personal identity is inseparable from your life work. So, when your business gets into serious difficulties, in spite of the best attempts of business schools and management training courses to make you a rational analyzer of data, objective analysis will take second seat to personal and emotional reactions almost every time."* 

> *"If you are a middle manager, many of the same considerations apply, but very often your job is also at stake. How your corporation succeeds in working its way through a strategic inflection point may determine what happens to your career."*

> *"A manager in a business that is undergoing a strategic inflection point is likely to experience a variation of the well-known stages of what individuals go through when dealing with a serious loss. This is not surprising because the early stages of a strategic inflection point are fraught with loss. Loss of your company's preeminence in the industry, of its identity, of a sense of control of your company's destiny, of job security and, perhaps the most wrenching, the loss of being affiliated with a winner. However, unlike the accepted model of the sequence of emotions associated with grief, i.e., denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, ultimately, acceptance, in the case of a strategic inflection point, the sequence goes more as follows, denial, escape or diversion and, finally, acceptance and pertinent action."* 

> *"Escape, or diversion, refers to the personal actions of the senior manager. When companies are facing major changes in their car business, they seem to plunge into what seem to be totally unrelated acquisitions and mergers. In my view, a lot of these activities are motivated by the need of senior management to occupy themselves respectively with something that clearly and legitimately requires their attention day in and day out, something that they can justify spending their time on and make progress in instead of figuring out how to cope with an impeding strategic destructive force. At such times, senior managers often involve themselves in feverish, charitable fundraising. A lot of outside board activities are pet projects. Take a look at a representative calendar of the CEO of a major corporation that was in the middle of a strategic inflection point, page 126. Does his allocation of time, his most precious reserves, reflect his strategic crisis? I don't think so."* 



> *"He is by no means unique, frankly, as I look back, I have to wonder if it was an accident that I've devoted a significant amount of my time in the years preceding our memory episode, years during which the storm clouds were already very evident to writing a book. As I write this, I wonder what storm clouds I might be ducking now, I'll probably know in a few years."*

For writing, according to our Julia Cameron, it works and works and it is the only way, for real, to get there. Yes, fixing the grammar and a conscious path is a must. The same for entrepreneneuship, the release of control also involves allowence go the joy of the day and the release of stress of trying to control - being romantic control or systematic control. See, for founders, controlling sales, or success can also be romantic control. What matters is coordination, with time and opportunity, moving, and of course, managing goals from time to time.  







If we subtract the normal growth curve from Paul Graham's curve, we have the hill of promise:

[Figure of the hill of promise]

Then we can formalize that entrepreneurs must be aware of their urgent steps when they enter the launch field. Because launches promise. The most important point, number one, is awareness and managing expectations - we must thank Paul Graham for reminding us that if things calm down, if they get boring, if the customer doesn't show up, etc., etc.; you weren't the first to go through this and you won't be the last. This path demands you to continue, and use the calm to learn and improve your solution, business, product, relationship, etc.

Point number two, that the initial promise, the launch - call it what you will - should be seen more coldly, as an experiment. This is a mindset and doing so not only creates less frustration but also helps in structuring the episode with more rigor and less bet, like thinking it will work out. This model of strategizing says that there is an overarching meta control - as if it were a premeditated battle where the outcome, positive or negative, is always positive, an experiment.

Now, looking at a more generalized issue regarding these two valleys - all of them and those who created them are warning us so that we can proceed, to be resilient. That is the main message allied to the message that says we were not the first and we will not be the last who will face these valleys.

But connected to this idea is an optimistic view, if we assume that the investment is precisely in the field of the valley, if we think it is worth it. The valley, in the optimistic view, of that entrepreneur or group that sees it as a challenge - and that allows time and invests in the situation - is the great opportunity. The valley is the real work that must be done, and the process of walking through it needs to be nurtured. It all starts with permission and time allocated. It's not to say that time pressure should be eliminated, that no schedule is needed. But it is to say that the solution should not be dominated by a time schedule only and that sometimes the group needs to launch into the valley with positive energy, with an attitude of understanding the problem and with curiosity as its guide.

The valley is the opportunity, not the death.

The insight from a research cited by "Are You Afraid to Identify as a Leader?, has shown that how challenge it is to support the developement of leaders as the consideration of a self-identity of a leader, has brought reputational concerns. As an example, employees might fear being seen as autocratic, different, or unqualified, when they consider themselves to embrace the role of leaders. Their research  suggests that organizations can impact the development of leaders and support a viewpoint that affects the psychological standpoint as taking leadership roles can be viewed as positive, and can be shown to be an area that is oriented to skills, and not as an innate ability: 

> "In one study, we found that participants who listened to a podcast in which we framed leadership as risky were less likely to identify or act as leaders than those who listened to a podcast that described leadership as low-risk. This suggests that simply by presenting leadership as less risky and lower-stakes (for example, by clarifying that leadership mistakes are expected and will not be a black mark on an employee’s record), managers can help employees feel more comfortable seeing themselves as leaders." https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Why would perceptions of riskiness influence something as deeply ingrained as your identity? From a psychological standpoint, however, this effect is not surprising at all. No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might think." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "And across our studies, we found that people who reported higher levels of fear around these reputational risks were less likely to see themselves as leaders. As a result, they were less likely to act as leaders, and therefore less likely to be seen as leaders by their supervisors." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

It comes through experimentation. Loosen up the level of control that the organization normally is accustomed to. Let people try different techniques, review different products, exploit different sales channels, and go after different customers. Much as management has been devoted to making and keeping order in the company, at times like this they must become more tolerant of the new and the different. Only stepping out of the old ruts will bring new insights." Andy Grove, p.130, Only the Paranoid Survive 

* Note - To know or not to know - feat. Maslow - "In any case, this close relationship between knowing and doing can help us to interpret one cause of the fear of knowing as deeply a fear of doing, a fear of the consequences that flow from knowing, a fear of its dangerous responsibilities. Often it is better not to know, because if you did know, then you would have to act and stick your neck out. This is a little involved, a little like the man who said, "I'm so glad I don't like oysters, because if I liked oysters, I'd eat them, and I'd hate the darn things'" p.63 Toward the Psychology of Being.

If she disappears and he becomes frightened, the curiosity disappears until safety is restored. She explores only out of a safe harbor." p.61 of Toward the Psychology of Being. Note: The note from Maslow, by indicating the child situation, the connection is too direct between safety and the act to learn, to go seek, to discover. Logically, in the adult that is not at risk of losing its safety needs; but the point is that these models are used for risk movements, curious movements; it is coherent anyway to seek the new only when you can be safe about the mechanisms that let you seek in the first place. In p.54-55 Maslow also points the "subjective device" that is added to "principle of the hierarchical arrangements of our various needs," which may explain in part how our models for growth from the child are mapped as models to the adult growth.  This may also have to do with any psicanalysis generally goes back to childhood to explain to the adult that the mechanism does not need to apply. 

* #greatness #hubris #fright Note - * To know, acessing - "The moment of fright is quite understandable, but must nevertheless be overcome if creation is to be possible. Thus, to discover in oneself a great talent can certainly bring exhilaration, but it also brings a fear of the dangers and responsibilities and duties of being a leader and of being all alone. Responsibility can be seen as a heavy burden and evaded as long as possible. Think of the mixture of feelings of awe, humility, even of fright that have been reported to us, let us say, by people who have been elected president." Maslow p 58-59

* #hubris - On fear of hubris - or greatness - For the individual level this might have been better reflected; of a fear that is different from that fear of knowing, and the fear of responsibilty (feat. Maslow, Toward the Psychology of Being). The fear of hubris may be a fear of the established system's fear of the chaos which may be applicable to the individuals, or the individual units of a system, willing and interested in growth. When in doubt, about to grow big or to be struck, some of these may be stuck due to an outstanding suggestion by whoever controls a path for the societal system, asking to not access the Gods, to not go too far (this may be a view presented by Maslow). This in the view of Dorothea, could be related, she points the case that professors of writing generally in the very first lecture put upfront that genious cannot be taught, which Dorothea disagree. Her book, becoming a writer, is for that. The fear of Hubris might happen to be the esteem level regulator esteem-level editor? while the fear of knowledge and responsibility acting on other level? 

    * Self-esteem regulating "Therefore, we speak simply of fear of knowledge in general without discriminating to sharply fear of the inner from the fear of the outer. In general, this kind of fear is defensive in the sense that it is a protection of our self-esteem, of our love and respect for ourselves. We tend to be afraid of any knowledge that could cause us to despise ourselves or to make us inferior, weak, worthless, evil, shameful. We protect ourselves and our ideal image of ourselves by repression and similar defenses, which are essentially techniques by which we avoid becoming conscious of unpleasant or dangerous truths." p.57 Maslow in Toward the Psychology of Being

Some individuals, through projects in the corporate setting, are likely expressing an identity which is not a reflection of their true self of the present. The expression comes as they perform, as they see themselves as conductors for certain causes - it could be a key result ahead of a major objective. This expression might come in various ways as they see themselves in a role, or as supporters of a cause, such as a cause of other supporters, advocates, leaders, mentors, investors, angels, you name it. Naturally, the sky is the limit. 

From a storytelling perspective, a doer in a cause can be seen as a protagonist, or a messenger, or a conductor. Although what they do involves a set of specialized actions and behaviors, like when one is in control of how they act, the performer displays and develop behaviors that at the same time express and shape their identities.  

Framing from a storytelling perspective will helps us to understand how emotions, such as feelings of loss, are experienced quite strong to a point of governing decisions - thus the use of our scarce resources. The book Storynomics (2018), whose audience is marketers interested in improving their communications, shows how people's perception about things can influence decisions. The authors refer to a selection of scientific works that shows that people's perceptions about pain (or pleasure) are felt based on what is presented to them - as in narrated - influencing them from how they imagine the given narrative. The selection of studies presented (2018, p.43) does justice to this idea by supporting scientific evidence for what the world of advertising has long before cracked, and profited for a while [^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics], althought generally understood as a subject of persuasion.

[^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics]: 

Now the fact that the advertising "of the west world" has discovered - by measuring results with customers - reveals that people decide based on narratives and stories that they are told and listen. In other words, it matters a lot - minimally for advertising agencies as we can confirm - that in the end of the day people bring to their lives, that they decide, based on what they listen, no matter if the the stories told are seen as persuasive forms of communication, or emotional communication, rhetoric, and on and on. Or, from another perspective, the advertising of the west didn't invent, indeed, as they had more like discovered, or understood, the natural mechanism of how people decide from the perspectives from the narratives that they are told. In part three, we will explore further the subject of human communication as narration [^footnote_prelude_human_narration] but for now we will maintain the equilibrium by focusing on how fear drives us, or how fears enter our narrative that drive us. 

[^footnote_prelude_human_narration]: The work of Walter Fisher, Human Communication as Narration, will support us to improve our awareness of how people reason and decise based on the the experiences that they tell and listen. 

But if what is told makes people fear is only does so effectively in the face of an ongoing conversaion, an ongoing train that is moving. We recognize this train of thought if we imagine a team of people in a locomotive where the destination is a city but out of the sudden the train stops right before a bridge. In this situation, if someone says that they might have stopped to appreciate the view, some people might laugh or be mad with the realization of the irony or how the observation does not fit the reality of what is happening. Thus the storied context makes the possibility for what is told to be coherent or not, to be truthful or not. Thus in the tracks of our work projects, such as an entrepreneurial effort, w happens is that things go awry, or appears to be going in the bad direction, exactly as we want things to go in a certain direction, such as to stop by a key result associated with a higher-order objective or destination. All sort of situations that trigger fears such as the consideration that projects are going to be abruptly terminated, such as that layoffs as necessary, or if an entire division needs to be closed. And how certain things are triggered to our lives appears in different ways, because one may feel compassion for the people who could be affected, or when a leader feels in a position of being a messenger for a cause, a train conductor, you name it. Just as a train conductor is happy when the train is running smoothly and feels bad when it's no longer operational, the context of entrepreneurship and businesses also means a track of possibilities where the performers are protagonists who cares more than being apatic participants in a train moving to a random place. We aren't moving to an arbitrary place and we are not apatic participants. We are moving towards aspiring goals and we are humans. 

Thus the work situation, and especially the entrepreneurial situation, creates a storied context where certain values are established and helps to create an equilibrium. These values can be acessed if we dig into reflecting within actionable ideas like "we need to keep working in this project tonight" which might be associated with expectations of significant milestones, such as expected state of happiness of the team, expected state of security to the team or the project, or any measure of success that is ahead. Thus it's natural for a person's identity to be linked as a responsible being, as a protagonist, emotionally and ethically connected to a duty. Conversely, it is natural to expect that a failure to do so, to operate towards the success, might trigger an actual real impact to their lives, like the unsolvency of their ability to work, which triggers other fears as, for example, people may need to work for money or other reason they hold as value. Suddenly, due to various factors, external or internal, experienced or perceived, the protagonists find themselves crafting narratives that are powerful in the face of the experience of fears they project.

Diverging or transcending?

What we can take away from this, once again, is a simple idea but one that we cannot ignore—we are human, we feel, and we will likely coordinate our entrepreneurial actions based on emotions. However, this doesn't mean we can't take time to recognize and reflect on all this. If the former Intel CEO recognizes that he was escaping from a larger problem by writing a book, could it be that we also sometimes engage in certain responsible actions as a form of blocking or self-defense to avoid feeling loss or strong emotions like fear and insecurity?

Getting to a strategic inflection point involves confusion, uncertainty and disorder, both on a personal level if you are in management and on a strategic level for the enterprise as a whole. These two levels are more intimately connected than one might think." Andy Grove, p.123, Only the Paranoid Survive. 

* We should also consider that the corporate version goes through the very exercise of transcending, such as when these companies fall into the modes of bets (check the usage of various levels of bets by the following paper article ft. Andy Grove). The consideration of a new style changing strategy, is then the realization of the need for transcending, searching a wider view - writing a book, acquision of companies, pre-mortem, you name it.

Andy Grove also articulated a corporate version of the potential for loss, self-defense—a situation where companies going through said inflection points decide to buy other companies. He questioned, in "Only the Paranoid Survive," why Japanese electronics companies, undergoing significant changes in their markets and industry, bought movie studios. For Grove, this could represent a form of escapism that ends up completely occupying managers' attention; they become too busy, they want to be occupied.
