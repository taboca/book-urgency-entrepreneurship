@outline - subject - Fear make us decide. Fears make us run. We need to acknowledge fear such as fear of knowing. 
--> 

In this chapter, we will consider the role of fear, especially in the fast-paced world, and how it affects our decisions, and our pace, such as the pace calling us for running. That, because fear can move mountains. Well, not really, not so direct. Maybe fear can prevent us to break our faith. 

<!-- 
@note * Fears vs. Faith - was broutht by Marcio. In the introduction, of the section Fears, Marcio has suggested a metaphor, that "fear can move mountains." Then, he objects to it, by saying that, perhaps not, that in fact fear can build faith. Although a bit coherent, this saying were lacking substance, or connection, as if it was metaphorical but not fundamented. But then, when reading Maslow's book "Toward a Psychology of Being," the section Entitled "Need to Know and Fear of Knowing," Maslow refers to a kind of fear that's different from the fear of knowledge, that is a fear of us becoming too great. And it seems to be that such fear is an attack, comes from an attack of the environment, of the superior, that to some, or perhaps a great, extent induces the subordinate to not become like Gods or greater. Maslow indicates that religions and other systems brings a kind of message about the dangers of allowing us to enter the space of knowledge, the dangers of letting us to become curious, the dangers of curiosity, the dangers of being Gods, or geniuses. And he suggests the trace, a preference for things like faith and belief and piety rather than knowledge. Or the feeling that some forms of knowledge were too dangerous to meddle with and had best be forbidden or reserved to a few special people.

@outline - situation - Fear is in us, humans carry. It gets into the language. 
--> 

If we set a time machine to somewhere 30000 to 36000 years ago, and find a human on a tree fearing the fearless wolf that paciently waits, we can visualize - and respect - that feeling which improves the chances for survival in the face of the danger. Someone in your ancestors tree feared a treat so that you can be reading this book and somehow feeling connected with that ancestor who survived. But back to the future of now, the metaphor that fears move mountains makes sense as decisions in the knowledge economy, especially in the digital landscape, are not disconnected from what we perceive, what we think, and what we feel. The mountain of now can be the pile of resources, such as money, or time. The wolves of now can be the competitor. And your organization is the tree of now, where we can go up and down, and hoping to survive. And if you do so, I hope that you have time to come down from the tree to paint the situation in a stone wall of now.

If some of that sounds far from where we are, I fear that we must confront, or celebrate, or accept, the fact that narratives driven by fear are quite naturally administered into the veins of our corporate body - even to a point where we don't make sense of how our now-networked brain responds. And all of this becomes even more serious given that the startup situation deals with threats as projections, idealized, more than real threats of the present. In other words, because growth is expected and ahead, and risks or prizes are there; it follows an implied element of risk analysis and the potential that larger sums of resources are lined up to be deployed under the expectation that it will support growth to happen. In other words, a lot is based on signals, or perceptions, therefore less related to real threats or iminent risk. 





<!--
@outline - complication - No room to discussion fears, the role of fear, how fears impacts productivity and strategy. But fear is presently influencing anyway, the moving to know more or to not be willing to know. The movement anyway, even to run, when we want to get away from problems. 
--> 





The reason for us to be together celebrating the role of fear, is that the entrepreneurial agenda does not allow room to discuss fears, or the role of fear, or how a language and dynamics oriented to fears is just part of our mechanism to be productive. In other words, fear drives productivity, fear eloquently shapes the narratives that create that affects our decisions. To note, or to narrow our scope and increase the complexity of the situation, the setting of a startup starts with a few people - founders and the small team [^footnote_blitzscaling_family_stage] - which certainly means agility, therefore increased level of authority. In other words, although the mountain of resources is small comparing with a large company, it is bigger in terms of impact to the path, to the future of the startup. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_family_stage]: Within the Blitzscaling lectures, the family stage refers to a small team, and it is stage one. 








<!--
@outline - GA - Running is not the purpose, is getting things done which is to know.

* Note - To get things done, you get to know. We either fear knowing it, to reduce anxiety, or we do not fear knowing it. The mechanism is to cut impulses to the know part, or to boost it. (Highly ingluenced by Maslow's model given in p.63 of Toward a Psychology of Being)

* Note - * Fear vs. knowing which is doing - "In any case, this close relationship between knowing and doing can help us to interpret one cause of the fear of knowing as deeply a fear of doing, a fear of the consequences that flow from knowing, a fear of its dangerous responsibilities. Often it is better not to know, because if you did know, then you would *have* to act and stick your neck out. This is a little involved, a little like the man who said, "I'm so glad I don't like oysters, because if I liked oysters, I'd eat them, and I'd hate the darn things." " Maslow, p.63 
-->






With that, and depending on the circunstances of what is ahead, we know that people can be more or less fearful. And, although we don't generally characterize teams, or divisions, as fearful, we will explore how the constituents turn fears into narratives that are powerful to change directions.If a team member had the courage to put straightforward such as "I am afraid of going in this direction" it would perhaps be a call for a debate. But reality is that fear chimes differently, like a movement in the backstage, such as when a local authority says "I fear that we will be killed by our competition." Therefore, in this chapter, we shall continue to respect fear as an element that pushes the entrepreneur's journey, not only the pace but also the path of innovation. 

Let's start with visualizing fear in the work situation first, how we experience it in ongoing conversation of the day - at the interpersonal level. Then we will explore how the individual is highly influenced by fears of threats - of course, not directly to their lives - but to their identities or a value that is key for their ongoing narrative. We will also consider different point of views and other reflections where fear is recognized as present from the individual level to the management situation of large organizations. As we move on, not to supress fear but to note and acknoledge, we shall identify more vividly how fear enters the communication of teams, and impacts decisions in the everyday, as it causes blockage, defense, censorship, or attack.

### The experience of fears 



#### The stakes are high, put that coffee down  



"This [project] will blow up!" Is what I once heard from my manager, shortly after I had entered the meeting room. I think that he feared a dead end, if we didn't act in a different way. Or, perhaps, he feared that weren't doing enough, or that we could put more effort, or do things in a different way, a better way, a faster way. What is interesting - now in retrospect - is that it didn't cross my mind to offer support to him, to elaborate on his fears. Perhaps that inaction was just part of the mood, and context, that we were in at the time. The mood that gave the title of "war room" to the temporary meeting place where most of us had to work for a while - a sacred space for getting things done. From that message, it was unavoidable to see a future where we would not exist, our team, and consequently myself as a worker of that well-known, and respected, Silicon Valley company. Plus, the rent. Plus, myself as an immigrant in US. 

A few years later, back in another office space of another Silicon Valley company, I caught a post-it glued to the keys of my laptop. It had a written message, "Things are not working yet!" Nothing signed. Not written in blood, nothing to be too scary. But I got scared, perhaps from seeing too many movies anyway, I don't know. I know that I couldn't think twice: I picked the post-it and showed to the startup's vice president, which happen to be who hired me. Hey, Bob, see this. The minute he read the note, he immediately said that "this is unacceptable in America!" I won't ever forget the precision of his move, or his motives, his reaction. I think that Robert were, to some extent, intersted in equalizing that situation - that complication - as in within 9 seconds. 24-hours later he told me that he was not anymore working for that company. I don't know if any of that were connected, I don't even know exactly what had happened. Anyway, in retrospect, I think that he feared that the company lacked a more transparent or ethical communication. Or perhaps he feared that the note would decrease my chances to thrive in that organization, to help the organization.  

With these examples, I am not saying that all employees, and management, that everyone follows primarily the dramatic moves given or driven first by fears. But it is undeniable, or primal, when fear chimes in and gives us an unsetting atmosphere one that sets us anyway, that take us, although it can appear in lighter ways or may be the kind of fear that some refer as raw fear. At this stage of reflection, my intent is to position us in the place of respecting that fear in the corporate setting might be present as a beast behind the actual scene. In other words, constituents are able to feel threats from a potentially risky situation which pulls them to come up with a narrative, which can become quite colorful, quite real, and meaningful. In other words, the feeling of a painful outcomes triggers the creative mind to come up with a story, a narrative, or a calling, like tigers, which may prompt us to take a actions, to decide, like to run. 





<!--
@outline - a1.1 - Storied context, narratives social 
--> 

#### Fears in the storied context 

Some individuals, through projects in the corporate setting, are likely expressing an identity which is not a reflection of their true self of the present. The expression comes as they perform, as they see themselves as conductors for certain causes - it could be a key result ahead of a major objective. This expression might come in various ways as they see themselves in a role, or as supporters of a cause, such as a cause of other supporters, advocates, leaders, mentors, investors, angels, you name it. Naturally, the sky is the limit. 

From a storytelling perspective, a doer in a cause can be seen as a protagonist, or a messenger, or a conductor. Although what they do involves a set of specialized actions and behaviors, like when one is in control of how they act, the performer displays and develop behaviors that at the same time express and shape their identities.  

Framing from a storytelling perspective will helps us to understand how emotions, such as feelings of loss, are experienced quite strong to a point of governing decisions - thus the use of our scarce resources. The book Storynomics (2018), whose audience is marketers interested in improving their communications, shows how people's perception about things can influence decisions. The authors refer to a selection of scientific works that shows that people's perceptions about pain (or pleasure) are felt based on what is presented to them - as in narrated - influencing them from how they imagine the given narrative. The selection of studies presented (2018, p.43) does justice to this idea by supporting scientific evidence for what the world of advertising has long before cracked, and profited for a while [^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics], althought generally understood as a subject of persuasion.

--> 

[^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics]: 

Now the fact that the advertising "of the west world" has discovered - by measuring results with customers - reveals that people decide based on narratives and stories that they are told and listen. In other words, it matters a lot - minimally for advertising agencies as we can confirm - that in the end of the day people bring to their lives, that they decide, based on what they listen, no matter if the the stories told are seen as persuasive forms of communication, or emotional communication, rhetoric, and on and on. Or, from another perspective, the advertising of the west didn't invent, indeed, as they had more like discovered, or understood, the natural mechanism of how people decide from the perspectives from the narratives that they are told. In part three, we will explore further the subject of human communication as narration [^footnote_prelude_human_narration] but for now we will maintain the equilibrium by focusing on how fear drives us, or how fears enter our narrative that drive us. 

[^footnote_prelude_human_narration]: The work of Walter Fisher, Human Communication as Narration, will support us to improve our awareness of how people reason and decise based on the the experiences that they tell and listen. 

But if what is told makes people fear is only does so effectively in the face of an ongoing conversaion, an ongoing train that is moving. We recognize this train of thought if we imagine a team of people in a locomotive where the destination is a city but out of the sudden the train stops right before a bridge. In this situation, if someone says that they might have stopped to appreciate the view, some people might laugh or be mad with the realization of the irony or how the observation does not fit the reality of what is happening. Thus the storied context makes the possibility for what is told to be coherent or not, to be truthful or not. Thus in the tracks of our work projects, such as an entrepreneurial effort, w happens is that things go awry, or appears to be going in the bad direction, exactly as we want things to go in a certain direction, such as to stop by a key result associated with a higher-order objective or destination. All sort of situations that trigger fears such as the consideration that projects are going to be abruptly terminated, such as that layoffs as necessary, or if an entire division needs to be closed. And how certain things are triggered to our lives appears in different ways, because one may feel compassion for the people who could be affected, or when a leader feels in a position of being a messenger for a cause, a train conductor, you name it. Just as a train conductor is happy when the train is running smoothly and feels bad when it's no longer operational, the context of entrepreneurship and businesses also means a track of possibilities where the performers are protagonists who cares more than being apatic participants in a train moving to a random place. We aren't moving to an arbitrary place and we are not apatic participants. We are moving towards aspiring goals and we are humans. 

Thus the work situation, and especially the entrepreneurial situation, creates a stotied context where certain values are established and helps to create an equilibrium. These values can be acessed if we dig into reflecting within actionable ideas like "we need to keep working in this project tonight" which might be associated with expectations of significant milestones, such as expected state of happiness of the team, expected state of security to the team or the project, or any measure of success that is ahead. Thus it's natural for a person's identity to be linked as a responsible being, as a protagonist, emotionally and ethically connected to a duty. Conversely, it is natural to expect that a failure to do so, to operate towards the success, might trigger an actual real impact to their lives, like the unsolvency of their ability to work, which triggers other fears as, for example, people may need to work for money or other reason they hold as value. Suddenly, due to various factors, external or internal, experienced or perceived, the protagonists find themselves crafting narratives that are powerful in the face of the experience of fears they project.

@outline - a2 - Recognizing 
-->

### Recognizing fears 






We want to feel emotions, we want to recognize fear, we want to allow ourselves to be vulnerable. These aren't  statements that we generally get busy with, or think of, in the entrepreneurial or even the corporate setting, in the arena. It sounds more like touchy-feely issues [^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely], more like the kind of things of a therapy session. So a real complicated question rises here - if the average runner is not talking, or reflective about that, do other people talk about these things outside that therapy room as in especially when they think about their role executing their startups? And when they grow, as they grow, and as they enter the growth stage of their companies, do they consider that as relevant? In other words, the founder-being that feels, the being that fears, do they have the power to mess up the growth of their company? And the collective being, the entity, shares patterns of constituent individuals or the collective is free from the fears due to the potentiality of the rational entity which is expected to be less subject to touchy-feely [^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely] issues? 

[^footnote_andygrove_touchy_feely]: In his book *Only the Paranoid Survive* (1999), Andy Grove discusses, in *Let Chaos Reign*, what he calls *The Touchy-feely Issues*, that in certain situations, particularly those faced by large corporations, managers often react emotionally to crises (p. 123) as business people are humans where their personal growth and emotions are closely tied to the identity and well-being of their business.

Let us dig into some well-known reflections about fears, and feelings related to fears such as fear of loss, from mindful doers that went through and witnessed and reflected about the challenging space of humans operating organizations for growth. This will certainly help us to recognize fear in our language, and anxiety that takes over which take us to know more or to deny knowledge, but to value that the theme is valid and it supports our conscious view; that to be aware and to not dismiss the subject as a serious subject. The allowance for disucssions about fears, the conscious discussions about how fears which gets translated into the narratives, is in itself powerful and can be a seed for the culture that is a truth seeking culture, an activity consisting of seeking honesty.  





The entrepreneur that embraces their fears, which allow the conflict and asks for help, is one that engages into the collaboration process; which is a big idea in the sense that it has to do with allowance for a wider view, a different perspective, which opens the door for an actual wiser view about the entrepreneurship, as opposed to be constrained living an identity, a role, that continues to operate using the same goggles and refusing to see it from different views. 







#### The works in the head - the experience in the head 




Perhaps this association is common in the world of artists or those involved in creative works. But it serves us well to reflect that a lot of what people do start in their heads, in a black box.

Thus, relevant in the entrepreneur's context is the censorship that becomes decisive, even though we don't  acknowledge fears. But our fears from situations like dreaming, reflecting, or planning, can quickly engage a self-censor. In other words, our fears might act behind the scenes although it impacts a world of possibilities, which might limit what we do. Dealing with these subject it not a simple task, such as of asking technical help or even reading book, because it involves taking initiative and to engage in reflective thinking, to put things in perspective, such as what comes from reflective writing or other related processes that involves asking for help, just like one would when one enters a session with a psychoterapeut, or a coach, or board members.  

Author Julia Cameron, known for her book The Artist's Way (1992), assists artists from various fields in navigating their creative potentials and blocks. Her 12-week course, which is outlined in the book, includes what is an apparently a simple exercise of "morning pages," consisting of writing long hand-written pages every morning; an essentially liberating practice that exercises the mind, much like a gym for the body, allowing the censoring side of the mind to cease stifling creativity. It's a technique that encourages making mistakes, experiencing fears, beginning with granting oneself permission.

Through Julia's explanations, we can see how she discovered this technique throughout her career. She was a recognized artist in Hollywood who, at some point, had her work rejected. In her account of the emotions she experienced, she likened the feeling of her work's rejection to the loss of a pregnancy.

* Doug Leone talking about fears is massging how to solve the problem, he is allowing himself. To know - of the fears? what you are afraid - may explain Doug's point "The adult human being is far more subtle and concealed about his anxieties and fears. If they do not overwhelm him altogether, he is very apt to repress them, to deny even to himself that they exist. Frequently he does not know that he is afraid." p. 61 


* Note - On fears -> anxiety -> is a prompt - "There are many ways of coping with such anxieties and some of these are cognitive. To such a person, the unfamiliar, the vaguely perceived, the mysterious, the hidden, the unexpected are all apt to the threatening. One way of rendering them familiar, predictable, manageable, controllable, i.e., frightening and harmless is to know them and to understand them. And so, knowledge may have not only a growing forward function, but also an anxiety reduction function, a protective homeostatic function." p.61 of Toward the Psychology of Being 

* Note - Inertia of success, from Andy Grove in Only the Paranoid Survive, connects, perhaps, with the point from Doug, the realization that the meta movement, leading to acceptance of a principle. A reference is the quote from Andy Grove - "Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to live with their strengths. So it's not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers - especially during their 'championship season.' I call this phenomenon the inertia of success. It is extremely dangerous and it can reinforce denial." Andy Grove, Only the Paranoid Survive, The Inertia of Success, p. 127

Doug Leone, partner of Sequoia Capital, explains how he keeps himself motivated and out of a comfort zone. He added that ""**raw fear**", is what motivates him; as he recalled the days when he would walk at the Stanford Shopping center, in 1988, making about 67000 dollars per year, knowing that he didn't have enough money to buy gifts (Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2014, 45:22). And went on, recognizing the fears that kept him to work, such as fear of being lay-off from Sequoia, fear of messing up with the life of entrepreneurs. Thus, for Doug, fear can be connected as a motivation force. That idea might be, for us now, an invitation to reflect that his views about fears might be in fact reflections of hopes, that may be for instance ways of his interpretations, ways to frame the path he is in.

#### The fearfull corporate beast   







Andy Grove also shared a similar idea about fears as a force that motivates creativity and action—fear of losing to a competitor, fear that the product is not good enough for customers, and more. 


For Andy, there exists a sequence of emotions similar to those experienced during the loss of loved ones, which can be experienced by people in the midst of what he called "inflection points." He suggests a parallel between the sequence of losing a loved one and the sequence experienced in the corporate domain during an inflection point. Grove revealed that he wrote one of his books amidst one of these turbulent journeys that Intel went through around the 1980s suggesting that in that situation, he might have been escaping from recognizing the situation? Perhaps?

What we can take away from this, once again, is a simple idea but one that we cannot ignore—we are human, we feel, and we will likely coordinate our entrepreneurial actions based on emotions. However, this doesn't mean we can't take time to recognize and reflect on all this. If the former Intel CEO recognizes that he was escaping from a larger problem by writing a book, could it be that we also sometimes engage in certain responsible actions as a form of blocking or self-defense to avoid feeling loss or strong emotions like fear and insecurity?

* "With all the rhetoric about how management is about change, the fact is that we managers loathe change, especially when it involves us. Getting to a strategic inflection point involves confusion, uncertainty and disorder, both on a personal level if you are in management and on a strategic level for the enterprise as a whole. These two levels are more intimately connected than one might think." Andy Grove, p.123, Only the Paranoid Survive. 

* We should also consider that the corporate version goes through the very exercise of transcending, such as when these companies fall into the modes of bets (check the usage of various levels of bets by the following paper article ft. Andy Grove). The consideration of a new style changing strategy, is then the realization of the need for transcending, searching a wider view - writing a book, acquision of companies, pre-mortem, you name it.  

* "the RISC team was able to get almost a third of the company’s microprocessor development resources even though top management had not made a corporate-level strategic decision to pursue RISC;"  https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/gsb-box/route-download/318706 Feat. Andy Grove. 

* "It is instructive to follow this development.

Andy Grove also articulated a corporate version of the potential for loss, self-defense—a situation where companies going through said inflection points decide to buy other companies. He questioned, in "Only the Paranoid Survive," why Japanese electronics companies, undergoing significant changes in their markets and industry, bought movie studios. For Grove, this could represent a form of escapism that ends up completely occupying managers' attention; they become too busy, they want to be occupied.

#### Challenging the narrative 







The insight from a research cited by "Are You Afraid to Identify as a Leader?, has shown that how challenge it is to support the developement of leaders as the consideration of a self-identity of a leader, has brought reputational concerns. As an example, employees might fear being seen as autocratic, different, or unqualified, when they consider themselves to embrace the role of leaders. Their research  suggests that organizations can impact the development of leaders and support a viewpoint that affects the psychological standpoint as taking leadership roles can be viewed as positive, and can be shown to be an area that is oriented to skills, and not as an innate ability: 

> "In one study, we found that participants who listened to a podcast in which we framed leadership as risky were less likely to identify or act as leaders than those who listened to a podcast that described leadership as low-risk. This suggests that simply by presenting leadership as less risky and lower-stakes (for example, by clarifying that leadership mistakes are expected and will not be a black mark on an employee’s record), managers can help employees feel more comfortable seeing themselves as leaders." https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Why would perceptions of riskiness influence something as deeply ingrained as your identity? From a psychological standpoint, however, this effect is not surprising at all. No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might think." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "And across our studies, we found that people who reported higher levels of fear around these reputational risks were less likely to see themselves as leaders. As a result, they were less likely to act as leaders, and therefore less likely to be seen as leaders by their supervisors." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader
