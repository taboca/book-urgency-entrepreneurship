@outline - situation - Fear is in us, humans carry, drives survival. It gets into the language.

Founders don't talk about fears. That is not because they fear fears. It is so because they are doers in the first place. That does not mean that they don't recognize fears. In fact, they do it so naturally, for the sake of not failing, in the name of getting things done. It's like a fear of things that help them into the movement, to know, to act, to do it. Before we check on the ways that fear acts on us we should respect fears because as we know even the wildest of the movements may actually be driven by fears

If we set a time machine to somewhere 30000 to 36000 years ago, and find a human on a tree fearing the fearless wolf that paciently waits, we may recognize - and respect - a feeling that improve our chances for survival in the face of the danger. Someone in your ancestors tree feared a similar threat so that you can be now reading this feeling connected with them. Some of you may be now observed by your puppy, Wolfie. Make sure you feed her well. 

As for the how that old fear now drive us, we should too celebrate our lighting-fast narratives driven by fear which are well-administered through the veins of our corporate body - even to a point where we don't make sense of how our now-networked brain responds. And all of this becomes even more serious given that the startup situation deals with threats as projections, idealized, more than real threats of the present. In other words, because growth is expected and ahead, and risks or prizes are there; it follows an implied element of risk analysis and the potential that larger sums of resources are lined up to be deployed under the expectation that it will support growth to happen. In other words, a lot is based on signals, or perceptions, therefore less related to real threats or iminent risk.

@outline - complication - No room to discussion fears, the role of fear, how fears impacts productivity and strategy. But fear is presently influencing anyway, the moving to know more or to not be willing to know. The movement anyway, even to run, when we want to get away from problems.

The reason for us to be together celebrating the role of fear, is that the entrepreneurial agenda does not allow room to discuss fears, or the role of fear, or how a language and dynamics oriented to fears is just part of our mechanism to be productive. In other words, we might have a reason to consider that generally unnoticed fear that drives our productivity, that in many circunstances eloquently shapes the narratives that affect our decisions. To narrow our scope at the risk of increasing the complexity of the startup situation, we should remind ourselves that the size and stage, of a small team [^footnote_blitzscaling_family_stage] which characterizes the early stage,means agility, indeed; which goes with that an degree of authority. In other words, although the mountain of resources is small comparing with a large company, it is bigger in terms of impact to the path, to the future of the startup. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_family_stage]: Within the Blitzscaling lectures, the family stage refers to a small team, and it is stage one.

@outline - GA - Running is not the purpose, is getting things done which is to know.

* Note - To get things done, you get to know. We either fear knowing it, to reduce anxiety, or we do not fear knowing it. The mechanism is to cut impulses to the know part, or to boost it. (Highly ingluenced by Maslow's model given in p.63 of Toward a Psychology of Being)

* Note - #unproductive - * Fear vs. knowing which is doing - "In any case, this close relationship between knowing and doing can help us to interpret one cause of the fear of knowing as deeply a fear of doing, a fear of the consequences that flow from knowing, a fear of its dangerous responsibilities. Often it is better not to know, because if you did know, then you would *have* to act and stick your neck out. This is a little involved, a little like the man who said, "I'm so glad I don't like oysters, because if I liked oysters, I'd eat them, and I'd hate the darn things." " Maslow, p.63

With that, and depending on the circunstances of what is ahead, we know that people can be more or less fearful. And, although we don't generally characterize teams, or divisions, as fearful, we will explore how the constituents turn fears into narratives that are powerful to change directions.If a team member had the courage to put straightforward such as "I am afraid of going in this direction" it would perhaps be a call for a debate. But reality is that fear chimes differently, like a movement in the backstage, such as when a local authority says "I fear that we will be killed by our competition." Next, we're going to first recognize the fears that pushes us to the movement, to do run or to do it, knowing of them or not, before considering the fears that may set us to be defensive or into being blocked. 

We'll start by visualizing how fear appears in the normal, average day of work at the language level, where us doers are either influenced or influencing the face of threats, fearfully driven to run faster, not because of a threat to our lives, but nevertheless to our identities or values we hold in the face of what we want to get done and our needs to grow and succeed. We follow with managerial conversations and perspectives where fear is acknowledged, either at the personal level or managerial discussions, such as in large organizations. We close, not in ways to suppress fear, but to acknowledge, to develop a conscious feel about the narratives and the two modes where fear either boosts to run faster or cut the impulses and keep us defensive.
