@outline - subject - Fear make us decide. Fears make us run. We need to acknowledge fear such as fear of knowing. 
--> 


If we could talk about fears, if we had the time, it won't take long to notice how it is not a subject common in the workplace, or our entrepreneurial lives. With a few steps further, we will also recognize a particular kind of fear, which can be tested, when observing the action of us doers. This one appears in our language, the one that sets the pace and asks for productivity. It is one that gives us the impulses, to get out from trouble, to do the mining work, to survive, towards success. This may be a kind of fear from failure driving us to seek answers. On the other hand, there is a fear that is hidden, which can cut our impulses to seek knowledge, especially when major changes are required. This one is rarely noticed but just like the other affects all of our movements. 

If the biblical passage had a typo in it and it had been said that fear, instead of faith, as the thing that move mountains [^footnote_biblical_faith_mountains], it would be literally applicable to our days since we are the ones moving a pile of resources, in the fast-paced way, grain by grain, bit by bit, byte by byte, from a place to another. For that, using a subjective language of action where we run from trouble given our fears: fear to fail, to be fired, to not be associated with success. But the passage uses faith instead and because of that it transcends the moment we live, it is stronger. For me, when I can't solve a problem, I generally think about faith, or hope. For me, it is a way to sometimes not enter into the trouble of trying to understand the unsolvable. 

[^footnote_biblical_faith_mountains]: This reference is to a biblical passage, specifically Matthew 17:20, where it is stated, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

<!-- 
@note * Fears vs. Faith - was broutht by Marcio. In the introduction, of the section Fears, Marcio has suggested a metaphor, that "fear can move mountains." Then, he objects to it, by saying that, perhaps not, that in fact fear can build faith. Although a bit coherent, this saying were lacking substance, or connection, as if it was metaphorical but not fundamented. But then, when reading Maslow's book "Toward a Psychology of Being," the section Entitled "Need to Know and Fear of Knowing," Maslow refers to a kind of fear that's different from the fear of knowledge, that is a fear of us becoming too great. And it seems to be that such fear is an attack, comes from an attack of the environment, of the superior, that to some, or perhaps a great, extent induces the subordinate to not become like Gods or greater. Maslow indicates that religions and other systems brings a kind of message about the dangers of allowing us to enter the space of knowledge, the dangers of letting us to become curious, the dangers of curiosity, the dangers of being Gods, or geniuses. And he suggests the trace, a preference for things like faith and belief and piety rather than knowledge. Or the feeling that some forms of knowledge were too dangerous to meddle with and had best be forbidden or reserved to a few special people.

@outline - situation - Fear is in us, humans carry, drives survival. It gets into the language. 
--> 

If we set a time machine to somewhere 30000 to 36000 years ago, and find a human on a tree fearing the fearless wolf that paciently waits, we can visualize - and respect - that feeling which improves the chances for survival in the face of the danger. Someone in your ancestors tree feared a similar threat so that you can be now reading this, feeling connected with that ancestor next to your puppy, Wolfie. 

But back to the future of now, the metaphor that fears move mountains makes sense as decisions in the knowledge economy, especially in the digital landscape, are not disconnected from what we perceive, what we think, and what we feel. The mountain of now can be the pile of resources, such as money, or time. The wolves of now can be the competitor. And your organization is the tree of now, where we can go up and down, and hoping to survive. And we you do so, my hope that we can have the time to reflect, first, and to come down from that tree and paint about that situation-complication, to help ourselves with a reflection and the next generation helping us. 

If some of that sounds far from where we are, I fear that we must confront, or celebrate, or accept, the fact that narratives driven by fear are quite naturally administered into the veins of our corporate body - even to a point where we don't make sense of how our now-networked brain responds. And all of this becomes even more serious given that the startup situation deals with threats as projections, idealized, more than real threats of the present. In other words, because growth is expected and ahead, and risks or prizes are there; it follows an implied element of risk analysis and the potential that larger sums of resources are lined up to be deployed under the expectation that it will support growth to happen. In other words, a lot is based on signals, or perceptions, therefore less related to real threats or iminent risk.

@outline - complication - No room to discussion fears, the role of fear, how fears impacts productivity and strategy. But fear is presently influencing anyway, the moving to know more or to not be willing to know. The movement anyway, even to run, when we want to get away from problems. 
--> 





The reason for us to be together celebrating the role of fear, is that the entrepreneurial agenda does not allow room to discuss fears, or the role of fear, or how a language and dynamics oriented to fears is just part of our mechanism to be productive. In other words, fear drives productivity, fear eloquently shapes the narratives that create that affects our decisions. To note, or to narrow our scope and increase the complexity of the situation, the setting of a startup starts with a few people - founders and the small team [^footnote_blitzscaling_family_stage] - which certainly means agility, therefore increased level of authority. In other words, although the mountain of resources is small comparing with a large company, it is bigger in terms of impact to the path, to the future of the startup. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_family_stage]: Within the Blitzscaling lectures, the family stage refers to a small team, and it is stage one.

@outline - GA - Running is not the purpose, is getting things done which is to know.

* Note - To get things done, you get to know. We either fear knowing it, to reduce anxiety, or we do not fear knowing it. The mechanism is to cut impulses to the know part, or to boost it. (Highly ingluenced by Maslow's model given in p.63 of Toward a Psychology of Being)

* Note - #unproductive - * Fear vs. knowing which is doing - "In any case, this close relationship between knowing and doing can help us to interpret one cause of the fear of knowing as deeply a fear of doing, a fear of the consequences that flow from knowing, a fear of its dangerous responsibilities. Often it is better not to know, because if you did know, then you would *have* to act and stick your neck out. This is a little involved, a little like the man who said, "I'm so glad I don't like oysters, because if I liked oysters, I'd eat them, and I'd hate the darn things." " Maslow, p.63

With that, and depending on the circunstances of what is ahead, we know that people can be more or less fearful. And, although we don't generally characterize teams, or divisions, as fearful, we will explore how the constituents turn fears into narratives that are powerful to change directions.If a team member had the courage to put straightforward such as "I am afraid of going in this direction" it would perhaps be a call for a debate. But reality is that fear chimes differently, like a movement in the backstage, such as when a local authority says "I fear that we will be killed by our competition." Therefore, in this chapter, we shall continue to respect fear as an element that pushes the entrepreneur's journey, not only the pace but also the path of innovation. 

We'll start by visualizing how fear appears in the normal, average day of work at the language level, where us doers are either influenced or influencing the face of threats, fearfully driven to run faster, not because of a threat to our lives, but nevertheless to our identities or values we hold in the face of what we want to get done and our needs to grow and succeed. We follow with managerial conversations and perspectives where fear is acknowledged, either at the personal level or managerial discussions, such as in large organizations. We close, not in ways to suppress fear, but to acknowledge, to develop a conscious feel about the narratives and the two modes where fear either boosts to run faster or cut the impulses and keep us defensive.
