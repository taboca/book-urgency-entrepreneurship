@outline - Startup trying to be right 
--> 


If to some extent, Julia asks to try the bad writer that leads to better writing which may set us to consider the failing entrepreneur that leads to better entrepreneurial action.  We'll inevitably need to go back to a struggle of the balance - to inescapably deals with what's the right way into growth, and when and how we can even allow ourselves to be free from controlling, to be flexible or creative. Even if there is permission, it would certain set us to deal with the critics, the criticism of failing, criticism of lacking responsibility, criticism of being arbitrary. 

And so, and if for a moment we think about, of perhaps escaping from being right feeling the fears of the open sea, we're jumping too fast and missing the point from Julia. It has to do with the very presence of that know-it-all critic that gets in the way, that is standing on our shoulders, in real-time and telling us exactly, mostly, what not to do; but by doing so influencing what to do, and creating a tension. This is not different in the entrepreneurial life or the writer's life. We are mainly proudly educated and we carry on a critic on our shoulders. Founders, like captains, carry on too a responsibility to operationalize things, in the first place. They're being somebody in the first place and producing in the first place. Navigating the world, the environment, as they have discussed; with the support from their social environment, as we have discussed, and in many ways wearing an identity, one mainly succeed. Perhaps we are not too different from those captains back in the 1500s, reading and writing letters from and to their kings. As founders we do it too, we read and write letters, to our kings - these can arbitrarily be parents, investors, mentors, and entities and roles within what we see as a supporting system of growth, which may also be characterized, but not limited to, accelerators, incubators, investors, customers, tools, systems, playbooks, plus AI mentors are too coming our way.

The author Dov Seidman, in *How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything*, introduces the concept of the *Valley of Confusion* which describes the "paths" people go through when they face challenges. He compares people who get a "B" grade with those who get an "A" and those who get a "C". The curve that many do is that in their attempt to go from "B" to "A" they end up falling into the "C" grade. This space in the middle is a confusing zone that indeed many get lost.

I clear see myself, now in restrospect, having being into that space, the "C" space, throughout the journey of writing this book. I got stuck, especially between the initial days in 2017 - when I were learning the Blitzscaling lectures - when I had set a target toward the book: I wanted a B-book which I thought would take me to a A-Book. Now from far it is clearer to see how that C-space developed, starting and giving up, for years, slow updates and attempts. At certain point, during one of these attempts, an encounter was special and made a big difference, which I may generalize as Julia Cameron, but the one thing I embraced from her perspective had really to do with that permission (to not be so right and) to accept my bad writing and or a bad writer. After not trying to sound right to the eyes of a critic (one I mainly had invented) I had started to recover myself, to discover myself, to engage as a writer, to move towards a voice. The permission to make mistakes unleashed a new kind of flow. It brought me to places, to write more like a human, places that would be impossible if I didn't change that prior mindset. 

Of course, it wasn't a shift in a day and then all were bright. But the light were there. A particular passage, as for the moments where that critic took me to that C place, had happened when I approached 300 pages. I felt that the number of pages had to be around 300 pages. So having set my market-driven critic in the next seat, I was approaching 300 miles into a road of confusion. Partially blocked, partially not blocked. Accelerating and breaking and stop here, move there, no no, turn here. Ahh, you are tailgating. What is tailgating? Oh now, that is full stop my friend. Oh, I think I passed. Watch out! No, wait this is good. Wait, it has passed a couple hours driving. Oh shit, the tank is empty. Let's fill the tank. Nice, there is an alcohol station there. I was living the attack happening at the level of sections and paragraphs and words and characters even. But mainly, aside from the observable effects of not evolving, at the core of it I were not enjoying to be a writr. Not enjoying anything, certainly. I were fighting. 

Having accepted the courage to not care about the number of pages, I had vitnessed how the process took off. I passed the 400 mark, 500 mark, 600 mark, not counting the pages in and out every day. Sometimes making nice curves and flowing I thought I saw that critic in the cockpit and perhaps I laughed - he were holding a headset I guess trying to say something. But the ideas started to make sense and I wasn't angry. And joy were there too. And when an eventual stop, of course, looking at the situation with road written, all seemed to be quite crazy and out of control, for a while. I felt a bit embarrassed, in a way, as in oops, and excuse me, I have to drink water. We can fix that mess later. As as far as fixing the mess left in the road, as far as the number of pages is concerned, I recall the growing of a movement of courage, and confidence, to remove paragraphs. A conscious understanding that I arrived at a place that I was able to leave things behind. First, doing that with sections, and to the point of removing about five chapters in a day - the book went from 620 pages to 480 in an afternoon. Not under the influence. How? I used the delete key. 

Now if I were challenged to set up a boat for the journey and reconcile the theme of fears, I would certainly invite Doug Leone and Julia Cameron and Sir Ken Robinson as they will be reminding us in enlightening ways that our drive to be right, to being right may connect with an actual denial and the fear of failure voiced by the real time and know-it-all critics that we create to ourselves to justify doing the way we do. But that nevertheless damages our ways, that bores us out from craft. That takes us from that ideal B to A into the sea of confusion. To close, we shall celebrate a point from Doug Leone that connects with the cultural movement of being so right: 

> *"We have a culture of taking risks. I prefer you take a shot. Iâ€™d rather have someone who gets A, F, F, A than someone that gets B+, B+, B+, B+. I prefer people who ask for forgiveness rather than for permission. You have to be willing to put yourself out of business by trying new things, before someone else does.*" (Leone, 2022)

Of course, especially for the case of writers but not limited to, we should add one more thought about the potential conflict between us creative doers vs. us know-it-all critics. In this context, it is better to simple celebrate the wisdom from *Becoming a Writer* about how, in the end, there is a place where both the creative doer and the critic doer can be happy. Dorothe Brand, in 1934, pulled that truth from her well, to tell yet-to-become writers about the peaceful place where these personalities do not have to attack each other in realtime. I think that this is applicable to the life of a writer, to the life of a developer writing code, to an individual going through projects and writing the narrative of their lives and their startups:  

> *"He has trained himself so that the physical effort of writing does not tire him out of all proportion to the effect he achieves. His intellect directs, criticizes, and discriminates whatever two possible courses present themselves in such a way as to leave the more sensitive elements of his nature free to bring forth its best fruit. He learns to use his intellect both cursively, as he works, and later, as he considers what he has done during the period of the creative flow. He replaces by conscious intention, and day by day, the drawings made on his fonts of images, sensations, and ideas by keeping awake to the observations. Ideally, the two sides of his nature are at peace with each other and work in harmony. At the least, he must be able to suppress one or other at discretion. Each side of his character must learn to be able to trust the other, to do what is in its field, and to carry the full responsibility for its own work. He restrains each side of his mind to its own functions, never allowing the conscious to usurp the privilege of the unconscious, and vice versa.*" Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)
