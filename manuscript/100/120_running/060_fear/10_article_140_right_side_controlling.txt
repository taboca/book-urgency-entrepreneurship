#### On the right side (of a bad road) 

What Julia suggests to the yet-to-become good and great writers is a path that starts with permission. Permission that will certainly bring a criticism of being wrong. Nevertheless, asking us into the stepping into what would be the "bad writing that leads to good writing" or the bad entrepreneurial actions that leads to good entrepreneurship may too suffer from a space of interactions with the environment, given that we are in a path of interactions with audiences and also with the environment that speaks to us as we have discussed.  

In other words, the startup pathways can indeed bring so many exciting confirmations, or validations, given by the external systems, an audience which we may want to please or one which are might be somewhat pleasing, so actual colorful things may come our ways, if not support that we are right by the frameworks - like accelerators, incubators, mentors, early customers, which can be seen as the right way of doing as told by this environment.

The author Dov Seidman, in *How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything*, introduces the concept of the *Valley of Confusion* which describes the "paths" people go through when they face challenges. He compares people who get a "B" grade with those who get an "A" and those who get a "C". The curve that many do is that in their attempt to go from "B" to "A" they end up falling into the "C" grade. This space in the middle is a confusing zone that indeed many get lost. 

I clear see myself, now in restrospect, having moving toward that space, the "C" space, in the journey of this book. I got stuck, especially between the initial days, when I were learning the Blitzscaling lectures and annotating with a B-target toward the book. Then it took me a C-stage, for years, with slow updates not really moving into the possibility. At certain point, in one of the attempts to get back to it, before the 200 days effort as a writer (writing), a special element came on my way, which I may generalize as Julia Cameron. But if I were to check one specific perspective leading to a great impact it had to do with that permission to not be so right and accept bad writing with the goal or reaching my voice or my words. The permission to make mistakes had unleashed a whole new kind of flow. That allowance, brought me to new places, to write with a human, places that would seem impossible if I didn't change my mindset in the first place. Even when producing it I had many moments of allowing a critic that would perhaps bring me back to C, such as when I passed 300 pages and felt that the number of pages had to be around 300 pages. So with a critic right there, I was going back to C, to confusion, to edit and write and critize all together. So I had to release from that "market-oriented" thinking and gave me permission to keep going, and then the process took off,  I passed 400 mark, 500 mark, 600 mark (not counting the pages removed every day). And it all started to make more sence, and I too noticed that I started to be comfortable in leaving things behind - which could be to some extend not so far from the idea of transcending. At a certain point, I removed about five chapters at once. How? I used the delete key of the computer. But to do that, to allow that kind of movement, would be impossible in the beginning when I wanted all things to be in there, controlling, trying to get things right.

We all recognize that many things are difficult, because there is this pressure to do better - we are always comparing our work to the external world. So often the "task" to be done, the challenge, becomes nebulous precisely because our reference is the external world - for example, many of the challenges faced by entrepreneurs are guided by metrics, like the idea of being better, faster, cheaper. Often, the pilgrimage in this valley becomes indeed frustrating because it starts with parameters, becomes mediocre, when it is limited to having to differentiate from something that others do, such as competition.

#### Controlling creativity 



Trying to control success is not a problem. But it may be so in the circumstances when the creative state is needed. For a potential writer, to think about the colorful, or unconscious, or daring, or bad writing as a path for a writer's path, is bad because of its uncertain path. For one that expects to be a writer, it is perhaps not an allowed path. Why? Because it can be far, it can be difficult, it can be painful, perhaps wasteful. Perhaps because the path towards what is uncertain is a tougher path, perhaps lacking responsibility, perhaps sounds like the steps of a gambler thus not the shortest path to success.  

But the goal, in reducing the controller, is not about encouranging the bad, or the arbitrary, and the colorful, as in for the sake of executing chaos, as if total chaos means creativity. But it may be essentially about creating the support conditions that set us free from the the extremme, the controller that allows no room for errors, for testing, for experiencing, for checking other views. 

In this regard, I would like to bring a concrete contribution from Maslow from *Maslow on Management*. When he refers to the creative being, the being that does not control the outcome. But see, the creative is not random too. He or she is just outside the pressure system of trying to control:

This allowing may set the team into joyful findings, if we put ourselves into the possibility. Thus, this is about having fun too, as a path. A gentlemen which I met in the bus one day asked me to organize the company, the room, without worrying about the outcome, that things would work in the end. I felt something big there as in "do not control". In the releasing control, as an exercise of process, we can find joy too, a calmness. What if we can do that perhaps "once a day" as opposed to "once a year" or "once the week" as opposed to "once a month". See, going back to recognizing the axis of the free and creative (not right) versus the controled and right way, we can unleash us into the "moments of relaxation" which may in fact set us into having clear views about the whole thing.
