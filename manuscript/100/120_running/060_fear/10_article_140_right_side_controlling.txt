#### On the right side (of a bad road) 

What Julia suggests to the yet-to-become good and great writers is a path that starts with permission. Permission that will certainly bring a criticism of being wrong. Nevertheless, asking us into the stepping into what would be the "bad writing that leads to good writing" or the bad entrepreneurial actions that leads to good entrepreneurship may too suffer from a space of interactions with the environment, given that we are in a path of interactions with audiences and also with the environment that speaks to us as we have discussed.  

In other words, the startup pathways can indeed bring so many exciting confirmations, or validations, given by the external systems, an audience which we may want to please or one which are might be somewhat pleasing, so actual colorful things may come our ways, if not support that we are right by the frameworks - like accelerators, incubators, mentors, early customers, which can be seen as the right way of doing as told by this environment.

The author Dov Seidman, in *How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything*, introduces the concept of the *Valley of Confusion* which describes the "paths" people go through when they face challenges. He compares people who get a "B" grade with those who get an "A" and those who get a "C". The curve that many do is that in their attempt to go from "B" to "A" they end up falling into the "C" grade. This space in the middle is a confusing zone that indeed many get lost. 

I clear see myself, now in restrospect, having being into that space, the "C" space, throughout the journey of writing this book. I got stuck, especially between the initial days in 2017 - when I were learning the Blitzscaling lectures - when I had set a target toward the book. What for me seemeed to be the C-space is the process of stating and giving up, for years, slow updates that seem a consistent way into possibility. At certain point, during one of the attempts, an encounter was special and made a big difference, which I may generalize as Julia Cameron, but the one thing I embraced from her perspective had really to do with that permission (to not be so right and) to accept bad writing. After not trying to right to the eyes of a critic (one I likely had invented) I had started to recover myself, to discover myself, to engage as a writer, to move towards a voice. The permission to make mistakes unleashed a new kind of flow. It brought me to places, to write more like a human, places that would be impossible if I didn't change that prior mindset. Of course, it wasn't a shift in a day and then all were bright. But one accepting that the light were there. As an illustration, when producing it I had some moments where that certain critic would be inviting back to C. One particular came about when I passed 300 pages and felt that the number of pages had to be around 300 pages. So with a critic right there, I was back to C, to confusion. I was partially blocked, partially not accepting new thoughts, not accepting the flow. I couldn't multitask, or reconcile, the creative one with the editor. They were fighting. Having accepted the courage to not care about the number of pages, I had vitnessed how the process took off. I passed the 400 mark, 500 mark, 600 mark, not counting the pages removed every day. But the ideas started to make sense. And I wasn't angry. And joy were there too. And another plus, as far as the number of pages is concerned, that I started to be comfortable in leaving things behind. That new move started with courage and confidence to remove paragraphs. Then sections. At a certain point, I removed about five chapters at once, the book went from 620 pages to 480. How? I used the delete key. That was basically the impossible, certain from the perspective I had in the beginning, when I wanted all things to be in there, controlling, trying to get things right.

We all recognize that many things are difficult, because there is this pressure to do better - we are always comparing our work to the external world. So often the "task" to be done, the challenge, becomes nebulous precisely because our reference is the external world - for example, many of the challenges faced by entrepreneurs are guided by metrics, like the idea of being better, faster, cheaper. Often, the pilgrimage in this valley becomes indeed frustrating because it starts with parameters, becomes mediocre, when it is limited to having to differentiate from something that others do, such as competition.

#### Controlling creativity 



Trying to control success is not a problem. But it may be so in the circumstances when the creative state is needed. For a potential writer, to think about the colorful, or unconscious, or daring, or bad writing as a path for a writer's path, is bad because of its uncertain path. For one that expects to be a writer, it is perhaps not an allowed path. Why? Because it can be far, it can be difficult, it can be painful, perhaps wasteful. Perhaps because the path towards what is uncertain is a tougher path, perhaps lacking responsibility, perhaps sounds like the steps of a gambler thus not the shortest path to success.  

But the goal, in reducing the controller, is not about encouranging the bad, or the arbitrary, and the colorful, as in for the sake of executing chaos, as if total chaos means creativity. But it may be essentially about creating the support conditions that set us free from the the extremme, the controller that allows no room for errors, for testing, for experiencing, for checking other views. 

In this regard, I would like to bring a concrete contribution from Maslow from *Maslow on Management*. When he refers to the creative being, the being that does not control the outcome. But see, the creative is not random too. He or she is just outside the pressure system of trying to control:

This allowing may set the team into joyful findings, if we put ourselves into the possibility. Thus, this is about having fun too, as a path. A gentlemen which I met in the bus one day asked me to organize the company, the room, without worrying about the outcome, that things would work in the end. I felt something big there as in "do not control". In the releasing control, as an exercise of process, we can find joy too, a calmness. What if we can do that perhaps "once a day" as opposed to "once a year" or "once the week" as opposed to "once a month". See, going back to recognizing the axis of the free and creative (not right) versus the controled and right way, we can unleash us into the "moments of relaxation" which may in fact set us into having clear views about the whole thing.
