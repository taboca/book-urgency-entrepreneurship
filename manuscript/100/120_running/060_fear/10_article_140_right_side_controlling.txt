#### On the right side (of the bad road) 

Here is where Julia Cameron comes to us again, her contribution set us into the enlighted ways and one that starts with permission. Permission to step into the opportunity path, permission to seek for engagement, for meaning, which may also mean that the path may appear to be wrong. By the way this opportunity path is about stepping into what would be the "bad writing that leads to good writing" or the "bad entrepreneurship of good entrepreneurshp". First, managing the possibility part, is pilar 1, supporting pilar. It's okay and real stories are not made of following the right stones and the "side B" of what it takes to do things matters. We need to grasp that first. That is that. 

Complex because being right, for the startup, may not look different from trying to be right for writing, as in good grammar or trying to write what others want to listen. In the startup situation the being right can be come out differently although the essence connects with being right in the eyes of another audience. And which is one of the criteria for the "right paths"? Following the stones such as the milestones that other successful stories, such as the milestones of success, seeking approaval from customers, from investors, from a process system that is seen as a validating process, sounding right to an advisor, and more. 

It is complex because in the startup situation it may be, for example, that quite exciting things are the actual things that are expected by this external system, an audience which we may want to please. The point is that colorful pathways can be these right pathways, and can be given by frameworks which can be seen as the right way of doing as told by their environment. It may be that the team sets a mat in front of them which in a way tells them where to jump - like a jump to conclusions mat [^footnote_jump_conclusions_mat], one which they can jump to, step into the right spots. 

[^footnote_jump_conclusions_mat]: The "Jump to Conclusions Mat" isn't really a game but a fictional product referred in the movie *Office Space*, to symbolize that humans may come up with systems that are meant to help them; but too that their own systems can also be means for executing and deciding in ways they want, as in to exercise control and not for being used as systems for comprehension. In the game, the player can "jump" to, literally by jumping on different labeled conclusions. The humor and satire of the game serve as a metaphor for the human tendency to jump to conclusions without sufficient evidence or reasoning. This product humorously critiques our often premature or simplistic decision-making processes, reflecting the broader comedic tone of the movie in which it appears.







The author Dov Seidman, in "How" (check page), introduces the concept of the Valley of Difficulty (check the name of the Valley) which describes the "paths" people go through when they face challenges; and he compares people who get a "B" grade with those who get an "A" and those who get a "C". The curve goes from "B" to "A", passing through "C". He points out, citing research (check), that between the "B" grade and the "A" grade there is a valley, a confusing and arduous place where many people get lost and end up stuck in the valley, receiving the "C" grade.

This space in the middle is a confusing zone that indeed demotivates many people, a valley that can be gloomy, in the sense that many get bogged down there. But those who pass through it manage to succumb (rise) and reach a clearer space, the "A" grade.

We all recognize that many things are difficult, because there is this pressure to do better - we are always comparing our work to the external world. So often the "task" to be done, the challenge, becomes nebulous precisely because our reference is the external world - for example, many of the challenges faced by entrepreneurs are guided by metrics, like the idea of being better, faster, cheaper. Often, the pilgrimage in this valley becomes indeed frustrating because it starts with parameters, becomes mediocre, when it is limited to having to differentiate from something that others do, such as competition.

#### Controlling creativity 



Trying to control success is not a problem. But it may be so in the circumstances when the creative state is needed. For a potential writer, to think about the colorful, or unconscious, or daring, or bad writing as a path for a writer's path, is bad because of its uncertain path. For one that expects to be a writer, it is perhaps not an allowed path. Why? Because it can be far, it can be difficult, it can be painful, perhaps wasteful. Perhaps because the path towards what is uncertain is a tougher path, perhaps lacking responsibility, perhaps sounds like the steps of a gambler thus not the shortest path to success.  

But the goal, in reducing the controller, is not about encouranging the bad, or the arbitrary, and the colorful, as in for the sake of executing chaos, as if total chaos means creativity. But it may be essentially about creating the support conditions that set us free from the the extremme, the controller that allows no room for errors, for testing, for experiencing, for checking other views. 

In this regard, I would like to bring a concrete contribution from Maslow from *Maslow on Management*. When he refers to the creative being, the being that does not control the outcome. But see, the creative is not random too. He or she is just outside the pressure system of trying to control:

This allowing may set the team into joyful findings, if we put ourselves into the possibility. Thus, this is about having fun too, as a path. A gentlemen which I met in the bus one day asked me to organize the company, the room, without worrying about the outcome, that things would work in the end. I felt something big there as in "do not control". In the releasing control, as an exercise of process, we can find joy too, a calmness. What if we can do that perhaps "once a day" as opposed to "once a year" or "once the week" as opposed to "once a month". See, going back to recognizing the axis of the free and creative (not right) versus the controled and right way, we can unleash us into the "moments of relaxation" which may in fact set us into having clear views about the whole thing.
