@outline - Startup trying to be right 
--> 

Julia sets writers to be prepared to being wrong as a way to escape the traps of being right. Now, if we consider the meaning of preparing to being wrong as a way to escape the traps of being right, we will inevitably set ourselves into the struggle of balance, inescapably dealing with questions such as what's the right way for growth. Even if there is permission, it would certainly set us to deal with our critics, the criticism of failing, the criticism of lacking responsibility, criticism of being arbitrary, and the like.

But right there, at that very moment, if thinking or struggling and considering the non-productive possibilities from that possibility, we are very likely missing the point from Julia, that it has more to do with how and when that actual presence of that know-it-all critic gets in the way. That in many situations we are simply unable to perform wth a more flexible mindset as we set our critics on our shoulders, so that in realtime they keep telling us mainly what not to do, and by doing so influence our what to do. And likely, the accumulated tension of non-productivity in the name of productivity. 

This is not different in the entrepreneurial life or the writer's life. We are mainly proudly educated and we carry on a critic on our shoulders. Founders, like captains, carry on too a responsibility to operationalize things, in the first place. They're being somebody in the first place and producing in the first place. Navigating the world, the environment, as they have discussed; with the support from their social environment, as we have discussed, and in many ways wearing an identity, one mainly succeed. Perhaps we are not too different from those captains back in the 1500s, reading and writing letters from and to their kings. As founders we do it too, we read and write letters, to our kings - these can arbitrarily be parents, investors, mentors, and entities and roles within what we see as a supporting system of growth, which may also be characterized, but not limited to, accelerators, incubators, investors, customers, tools, systems, playbooks, plus AI mentors are too coming our way.

The author Dov Seidman, in *How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything*, introduces the concept of the *Valley of Confusion* which describes the "paths" people go through when they face challenges. He compares people who get a "B" grade with those who get an "A" and those who get a "C". The curve that many do is that in their attempt to go from "B" to "A" they end up falling into the "C" grade. This space in the middle is a confusing zone that indeed many get lost.

This is everywhere and it is observable. Therefore, in retrospect, I didn't have trouble to identify this situation from my own story when trying to write this book, in the first years, where I had started in 2017 when learning the blitzscaling lectures. At that time, I had a target - doing things right. So I was trying to write right first that B-book of course in a route to make it an A-book. That was sort of my good goal. Not knowing at the time, following the plan of being right, I brought myself into that C space. The observable effects of that space of confusion involved sporadically moments of work, giving up, trying again, letting time pass, days, weeks, months. I was productive in terms of too many moments of interruption or acts that procrastination. But the worst, an accumulated debit, really had to do with a growing frustration which was not clear at the time - of one being bored from that space of confusion, perhaps distancing myself from true writing, not being happy. 

At certain point, during one of these attempts, an encounter was special and made a big difference, which I may generalize as Julia Cameron, but the one thing I embraced from her perspective had really to do with that permission (to not be so right and) to accept my bad writing and or a bad writer. After not trying to sound right to the eyes of a critic (one I mainly had invented) I had started to recover myself, to discover myself, to engage as a writer, to move towards a voice. The permission to make mistakes unleashed a new kind of flow. It brought me to places, to write more like a human, places that would be impossible if I didn't change that prior mindset. 

I'll give you a particular window into how that critic were attacking me into that C space. One special passage happened when I approached about 300 pages, because I felt that the total number of pages had to be around 300. When mentioning to colleagues, I got a positive feedback that it seemed correct to be monitoring. Anyway, having set my market-driven critic in the next seat, I continued to run after 300 miles into that road of confusion. I was partially blocked, partially not blocked, accelerating and braking and stopping. Hey, stop here. No, turn there. Watch out - this is tailgating. What is tailgating? Now you have to do a full stop my friend. Oh, I think I just missed that exit. Watch out. No, wait. This is good, wait. It seems that we drove for too many hours, by now. Oh, shit, the tank is empty. We should fill our tank. Oh, nice, there's an alcohol station right there. That kind of attack was happening at the level of sections, of paragraphs, and even words. But take aside these observable effects, there's something else going on within that car - a major movement inside, at the core. In the inside, I was not enjoying to be a writer that way. Not enjoying at all. Circling, fighting, wasting energy. It was pressure from inside, two people talking at the same time. So chaotic that one would I think that that situation would, perhaps, cause a major destruction. No, it had caused the destruction that creating an illusion that I would engage with work (don't want to say writing) like that. The destruction was evident by some of the pauses in the cockpit where you just don't feel you want to drive again. You can't even tell why. 

Having accepted to not care about the number of pages, anyway for a while, I had witnessed how the process took off. I passed the 400 mark, 500 mark and 600 mark, not counting the pages coming in and out, everyday, extra rides. I was making nice curves and flowing. I even thought I saw that critic in the cockpit waving a headset in his hands. He was trying to say something. I felt a productive traction, ideas that started to make sense. But more than that, I wasn't angry. I had joy next to me. And when I eventually stopped in the cockpit, of course looking at the whole situation and the marks by the characters left behind, it indeed seemed to be a little crazy and out of control. I felt a bit embarrassed, in a way, as in "oops, I did it again," or oops, excuse me. But somehow a thought came in, from the confidence I felt, that I could fix things later. Or that someone else could. And as far as fixing were concerned, fixing the mess left the road, and as far as the number of pages were concerned, I recall the growing of a movement from confidence and from clarity. That movement was a call for a friendly editing and a force to fix and even remove paragraphs, and sections. It was a conscious understanding that I arrived at a place that I could leave certain things behind. So I started first doing it with sections, up to a day that I recall removing about 5 chapters, the book went from 600 pages to 480 in an afternoon. This is not a driver drivig under the influence. If I wasn't driving under the influence, how would I remove chapters at once? I used the delete key.

Now if I were challenged to set up a boat for the journey and reconcile the theme of fears, I would certainly invite Doug Leone and Julia Cameron and Sir Ken Robinson as they will be reminding us in enlightening ways that our drive to be right, to being right may connect with an actual denial and the fear of failure voiced by the real time and know-it-all critics that we create to ourselves to justify doing the way we do. But that nevertheless damages our ways, that bores us out from craft. 


In closing our thoughts for this section, we should celebrate tahe perspective from Doug Leone that explains the culture style that seeds Sequoia Capital out of being right like other firms: 

> *"We have a culture of taking risks. I prefer you take a shot. Iâ€™d rather have someone who gets A, F, F, A than someone that gets B+, B+, B+, B+. I prefer people who ask for forgiveness rather than for permission. You have to be willing to put yourself out of business by trying new things, before someone else does.*" (Leone, 2022)

Of course, especially for the case of writers but not limited, we should realize that intermediary conflict celebrate its existence as in respecting and noticing when that creative doer fights with our know-it-all critic. Indeed, these personalities are roles in the same room, especially in the beginning of professional journeys, where we engage in a fight and it looks like a struggle and it's a struggle that confuses us. The light, at the end of the tunnel, if we accept to see it, is an enlightened place where they can collaborate and as well said by Dorothea Brandy from *Becoming a Writer*. Dorothe Brand, in 1934, pulled that truth from her well, to tell yet-to-become writers about the peaceful place where these personalities do not have to attack each other in realtime. I think that this is applicable to the life of a writer, to the life of a developer writing code, to an individual going through projects and writing the narrative of their lives and their startups:  

> *"He has trained himself so that the physical effort of writing does not tire him out of all proportion to the effect he achieves. His intellect directs, criticizes, and discriminates whatever two possible courses present themselves in such a way as to leave the more sensitive elements of his nature free to bring forth its best fruit. He learns to use his intellect both cursively, as he works, and later, as he considers what he has done during the period of the creative flow. He replaces by conscious intention, and day by day, the drawings made on his fonts of images, sensations, and ideas by keeping awake to the observations. Ideally, the two sides of his nature are at peace with each other and work in harmony. At the least, he must be able to suppress one or other at discretion. Each side of his character must learn to be able to trust the other, to do what is in its field, and to carry the full responsibility for its own work. He restrains each side of his mind to its own functions, never allowing the conscious to usurp the privilege of the unconscious, and vice versa.*" Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)
