Scaling models affects time reality -- capsules of models -  unconscious about unit of resources and investing bet, analysis of models of support, parallel realities.  -  Models do what? Framwork? Incubation? Tools, frameworks, traction with customers?  With some of these pathways being promising, but the entrepreneurs capsule having rudimentar setting and limited fuel. The willingness to find a solution in a new world, a given path of effort, pulls. Part of them want to visit planet X because of love, part of them seem to know that time is moving, that fuel is being used. The complication is that, new data comes their way, such as insights from the team about management of resources, they fail to manage the fuel of the critical energy unit, the human being and each individual. The answer to the problem lies in respecttime and to know that time is relative. Could, perhaps, connect with how entrepreneurial journeys start. Perhaps the idea of "I will make a startup" fits in a wider bucket, in the end of the day. Let's be honest, and for that we need to look at some of the patters of growth, in terms of organizations. Some startups start with the ideal to scale fast but then notice that the area/domain chosen might need some other strategy for that. In Blitzscaling, Reid and Chris bring about the fact, or the test, that are things that could indeed have a scaling nature. 




And I don't even know if I went there in the first palce to save the people from earth. Maybe I am just wanted to learn what is out there. We should keep annotated, that some of these astronauts do find interesting new worlds and ways to change reality of earth, and ways to impact people from earth. When that journey involves the right team, the right planet, and a lot of learning that helps them to assemble what they need, on the go, or when they get support from the beings of a higher dimension, yes, it seems to be amazing journey. Is what I hear from people that reported on the actual life journeys. 





### Fazejamento

A related idea was presented by FabrÃ­cio Morini, a situation of entrepreneurs that adopt a reactive style, moving in response to environmental situation, like the present. He called it "fazejamento", an English equivalent would be the "Do-ification" that is common wit all sorts of enterprises and may actually work for some situations. Plus, learning after is certainly better than nothing. But in the context of startups and any entrepreneurial effort oriented to growth, the doing and learning after mistakes is not enough. 



### Infinite apprentice 

We need to respect ourselves, starting with time. In other words, the question is: At the minimal level, with no no map to assemble the rest of the ship as it travels fast, with no guide to pick the right guide, and no special star appears to be more promissing, what to do? 

For an enlighed view on what it takes to grow, we can make evident that awareness about the learning of how we do it is key, can be expressed by the question "How did I do?" Reid Hoffman says that Brian cheeky asked that question in the light of his first press event for Airbnb. For Reid, Brian is an infinite learner [^footnote_reid_hoffman_brian_infinite_learner].  Thus, perhaps, the actual complication is that we see no reasons for being an always learner, or we shall not even grasp what is the nature of that. And if we face, it, why? Isn't it an infinite learner one that wastes time? It would be, if one actually in fact reads Reid's comment too fast. A too-fast consideration for this notion can take us to find an instant objection - a yellow light that blinks and tell us that we would run the risk of being obsessed with learning, or losing focus. 

[^footnote_reid_hoffman_brian_infinite_learner]: 

The nature for explaining the infinite learner lives in the very same interview video when Brian recognizes the know-it-all model and the risks of bring one: 

> *"" Brian Chesky 

In other worlds, an infinite learner that is not a know-it-all suggests the notion of the infinite apprentice, as illustrated in the situation that was light for Reid, Brian displayed a self-awareness of being an apprentice on the go, which is very different from being an apprentince after the fact. In other words, being humble and to be aware that what might be happening at all stages, need a state of awareness about its learning, which bring us to the the notion of the experiential learning and connecting the dots that learning in the environment of entrepreneurship involves the recognition of learning with the experience, experiential learning.
