### Infinite apprentice 

We need to respect ourselves, starting with time. In other words, the question is: At the minimal level, with no no map to assemble the rest of the ship as it travels fast, with no guide to pick the right guide, and no special star appears to be more promissing, what to do? 

For an enlighed view on what it takes to grow, we can make evident that awareness about the learning of how we do it is key, can be expressed by the question "How did I do?" Reid Hoffman says that Brian cheeky asked that question in the light of his first press event for Airbnb. For Reid, Brian is an infinite learner [^footnote_reid_hoffman_brian_infinite_learner].  Thus, perhaps, the actual complication is that we see no reasons for being an always learner, or we shall not even grasp what is the nature of that. And if we face, it, why? Isn't it an infinite learner one that wastes time? It would be, if one actually in fact reads Reid's comment too fast. A too-fast consideration for this notion can take us to find an instant objection - a yellow light that blinks and tell us that we would run the risk of being obsessed with learning, or losing focus. 

[^footnote_reid_hoffman_brian_infinite_learner]: 

The nature for explaining the infinite learner lives in the very same interview video when Brian recognizes the know-it-all model and the risks of bring one:

In other worlds, an infinite learner that is not a know-it-all suggests the notion of the infinite apprentice, as illustrated in the situation that was light for Reid, Brian displayed a self-awareness of being an apprentice on the go, which is very different from being an apprentince after the fact. In other words, being humble and to be aware that what might be happening at all stages, need a state of awareness about its learning, which bring us to the the notion of the experiential learning and connecting the dots that learning in the environment of entrepreneurship involves the recognition of learning with the experience, experiential learning.
