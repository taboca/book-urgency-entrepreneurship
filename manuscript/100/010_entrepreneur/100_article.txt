# Accounting 

As our world becomes automated, or artificially intelligent, or smarted in non-organic ways, one of the predictions I have seen is that the profession of the accountant will go away. That says that accounting, as in accounting of a business, can be done by a machine or a system. That seems to be the case, it is observable, because many functions of accounting are being embraced by autonomous systems. But it comes with that, and given that we have created these machines in the first place, the possibility of a profound respect for accounting, although we take it for granted. In other words, there is something which we don't see, not so viscerally observable, but it is something that we value, and we are integrating it into our lives through these systems, to help us by the hour, or in real time.

To appeal to its importance, or its fundamental importance to us, we should borrow an analogy from the world of music and relationship with classical music. According to Benjamin Zander, the author of The *Art of Possibility*, the percentage of people that loves classical music is quite low. But what he has to say is, you haven't seen nothing yet; and he proves that everyone loves classical music. Similarly, there is something about accounting for us, to our lives, if we are sensible to its principles, it may take us to see possibilities.

Now with that said, a little, maybe a major complication comes our way exactly because we take it for granted and exactly because we may not be sensible enough to understand its principles and to read it in ways that can take us to be calmer, to understand its fundamental values which can take us into - you haven't seen nothing yet. For example, that accounting perspective changes in time. In other words, what we are counting and recounting changes. So in part that evidently brings us to a major problem in general when we jump to do things exactly because we choose to count them so bad intrinsically that we may jump into counting and recounting by using metrics and systems, although by considering the numbers that may not matter to us in general. In other words, we might hear certain new modern kinds of music because others are dancing with it and might not be sensible to understand that there are solid principles of accounting that we can take with us that can truly take us into possibility. Let us consider, guided by this inspiration with accounting, some of the elements that are important to observe, elements that we are using it in our journey as in ourselves.

It is an essential element for moving forward, for learning, for changing, for having new ideas, for evolving. We can't move on without counting and recounting the history of our movements and with that using, creating abstractions, entering reflections so that we can evolve not only the important things to count and recount, thus to revisit what matters. Here, we're going to respect that. Let us start with us.

From the world of entrepreneurship, there are many people passing on recipes about what to do, the right way, and what not to do, the wrong way. They are unstoppable - no matter how far they are - and it is part of their craft that they keep doing and that they keep sharing and telling us what they do, how they do, and who they are. From my own journey, through hopes and hopping through what they say, and recipes, one in particular has hit my board. This arrow was labeled *Wantrepreneur*.

*Wantrepreneur*, which seems to be in English, is a term that may or not come your way, but it came my way. It refers to someone who pretends, who seeks status, as an entrepreneur, as opposed to focusing in execution work which really makes one to become. This categorization, or definition, isn't necessarily evil; and in fact comes with a great deal of good intentions because it's a warning and it's given by some of them, them who likely think of themselves as entrepreneurs, and who bring their good intentions, to help others in the right way. Their alert serves a potential purpose to help with the entrepreneur's destiny? Maybe, where not the status has to be pursued but the action of entrepreneurship, which aims for results, which demands impact. Well, what could one say if not to nod under the idea that there is nothing too wrong with that. When revising this section, I asked ChatGPT, what is wantrepreneur?

> *"Wantrepreneur is a pejorative term used to describe someone who talks about starting a business but never takes concrete steps to make it a reality. In other words, it's someone who 'wants' to be an entrepreneur but doesn't act as one. A wantrepreneur may spend a lot of time reading about business, watching lectures, or taking courses, but they never actually start their own venture. They may have many ideas but don't act on them or execute them. Often, these individuals may be more in love with the idea of being entrepreneurs than with the reality of working hard to build and manage a business. The term is often used to emphasize the importance of action and execution as opposed to mere contemplation or speculation in the entrepreneurial journey."* ChatGPT

More specifically, in the face the positive tone by these voices - which may attack the state which they are trying to avoid to the entrepreneur - one may enter a space of confusion or to be stuck or blocked or bored about their own actions, such as actions when they speak of what they are or who they are or what they are doing, while in the beginning, which by the way are not actually different from the ones who become after validation of the audiences.  Now, if that's one thing, there's an even more important complication from there, which is that they may actually not only deprioritize that kind of a supposedly toxic focus, by embracing another tone or another way of operating, which is to execute and to do things first or to follow the right way in the face of getting things done. Furthermore, that execution, which may inevitably take them into problems, may create further complications for them, not only because of the detachment from themselves, but also because of surprising frustrations from execution. In other words, the complication is that it does deal with the process, for instance, for those who are beginners and trying to emerge.

@meta @Outline
* outline - Introduction - Question and Answer - (Elaborate) Breaking down - Can it be taught?  
--> 

The real question is whether entrepreneurs start their journey with the goal of becoming entrepreneurs without being entrepreneurs. Can they do that way? Moreover, can they start entrepreneurship based on motivations, based on inspirations such as when inspired by successful entrepreneur models? Also, is wanting to be an entrepreneur a valid destination? Currently, yes, the entrepreneur can and should want to be, can and should desire to pursue dreams, can and should be inspired by examples, can and should express his ideas out. Indeed, they risk falling into the abyss and staying there at the bottom of the entrepreneurship ocean, somewhat conversing with model entities, learning, and experiencing the wonders of the romantic world of entrepreneurship. While exiting the abyss, rising to the surface, is important - as no one denies the fruit of entrepreneurship is changing the environment - still, the great complication of negatively labeling the wantrepreneur lies in the small chance of the protagonist going directly to a supposed successful execution, a supposed act of delivering results.







In summary, we can't say that the wantrepreneur role has to be redefined. We shouldn't bother with specifics from ideas that aren't clear yet; and we can do better by turning our attention to the what matters, such as to consider the actual path of development and the actual considerations that characterizes the entrepreneur in development.

### The modern pathways

* outline - answer k1 - Writing, networking, sharing, even theorizing seems to be part of the moden craft 
--> 
It used to be the case that entrepreneurs were forged by an environment, such as the place where they lived through challenges firt hand, where some of them raised alone to change their environment and their lifes, and some others had the opportunity to be educated, such as doing the craft like apprentice, and others found ways to have their journey smoothed in a way, with protection like investment. We can go into history of the industrial revolution looking for the inventor's role, it becomes vivid how the environment where a ground for change.  

But nowadays, althought sometimes the learning path seems quite structured, there is an abundance of far too many pathways that seem to be the right way to go, it becomes structured and unestructured by the abundance, by the excess of stories, recipes, methods, advice, systems, networks, platforms - ideas being exchanged. What were more of an entrepreneurial framework by a forceful environment became what seems to be yet another way of working. That, in a way, seems like good news, many more are able to get into what they can see as an entrepreneurial pathway, if they want. As in, the entrance points have indeed exploded and with that the exit points too happen to reflect the input. 

Through modern, and oftenly confusing pathways, one pattern common is to move up the ladder with advice which many may even see these elements like building blocks. Navihating with that seems to be Right or Wrong, it is not easy as the dynamic environment is far from the problem of the blank canvas. Nowadays, these elements on the way of entrepreneurs are quite interactive, and iterative, more like a drawing that is initiated and where you have to complete or to color it. It provoke us to fill the blanks, to play the game.

* outline - answer k1.1 - The wantrepreneur incident and attack  

#### The nature and reaction to the wantrepreneur attack 
--> 

It would appear to not be harmful, especially for the stronger kind that has confidence in its path, the encounter with the voices and characterizations of an Wantrepreneur. From an optimistic view, it's for good; it means no harm. And it a warning sign, a sign of advice, and it is emblematic and hopes to adds perhaps a good level of pressure, for the good of entrepreneurs. 

But let's face it, it's easy to be articulated by those who have made it after they have failed before achieving status of true entrepreneurs. It's these individuals, which claim themselves to be right side of character, which now feel empowered to pass on their recipes, now feeling that they raise these warning signs. They claim, so, don't be a wantrepreneur, don't write, don't claim to be, don't communicate much or get into the wanting context. But the dangers of such attack will only happens for the one in the aspirant stage, while under construction, in the waiting list and willing to do so, in the line to become and embracing the spirit of an entrepreneur, even before they can deliver, act, and execute. Now, a consideration has to be made that such attack is a social construction. In other words, the formation of the idea *Wantrepreneur* becomes critical by a self attack instead of any specific work of art of one or other that had written about it. After all, if anything is out there it all exists as part of the very same mechanism of learning where they learning by writing, by giving out advices, by claiming to be entrepreneurs even if the claim sounds a bit convolucted in nature when they express their wants to be by referring to the wants to be. 

But it finds its way into being harmful by the very usage, like a meme, and within the urgent ecosystem. Therefore, the attack flies arbitrarily and unfortunatelly by the nature of half-words of mouth, or echoes of a hopefuly more elaborated though, misses the small letters if any of the actual articles had it. It becomes, therefore, dangerous not by the actual content that once have been written by one or other that came up with that fusion of words if any of that had brought arguments and nuances. It becomes dangerous by the narrative created by the very reader, the entrepreneur, that reads it too quick, and many that don't even engage in any reflection and just use the noun to demand immediate action. When the aspiring entrepreneur gets that arrow, the only label they see is an urge to flip her character towards being the being that gets things done, in a hurry. The risk of moving too quick from wanting to be into getting things done might be, in itself, the movement of real desperation, under the flames, might be the movement of really wanting, but in the end can becomme a delusional movement supported by an arrogant simplification that getting things done is of higher importance than the things related to wanting to be an entrepreneur. 



My concern with the kind that characterizes the pathways has brought us here mainly because of some potential fears - and for that I had to come up with some extremme possibility - where the actual entrepreneur in development may fail by their own critics that is yet weak in the beginning, in the early stage, as she faces the characterizations that the one that "getting things done" is better; which sets her into confusion on her journey which would otherwise continue to flowerish and would even get into the affairs with the perceived getting things done as expected by all. This possibility, being more or less the case in the life of the concerned entrepreneur, is anyway a good reason for them to preserve the consciousness for what they are actually doing, such as the consciousness to prevent the movement straight into doing it, the pure execution, the full devotion to delivery with no regard to the other side - equally important. For one that does in the extremme end of it, they run into missing a key element, may get lost into getting things done with a view that they are developing what is good, and positioning out of the track, and involvement and exercising, the very element that actually make much of the entrepreneurial things real. Therefore, in other words, this entrepreneur in development, which might be yet weak, or some of its emotional being part might be affected by attacks, can hesitate to move in the right track. If so, then, it is then important for them to keep an eye on these attacks - or the self attack - that actually gets in the way and makes them either stuck, like blocked, or into the getting things done to fit the world as expected, and by driving its steps by the criticism of execution oriented to the external perspectives about what means execution that they find themselves in their way to be, again, blocked, to die slowly, to interrupt. 

Therefore, the point of establishing a careful consideration for potential attacks is mainly to preserve the executor of your entrepreneurial path. Keeping it alive and well. See, execution and getting things done has a duty which is the duty to bring about the changes sought which will require to bring about the changes of development of the self, the team, the organization. The path to get there has to involve the establishment of a healthy path and the healthy path should take care of the innocent movement, should preserve the sensitive side, and the emotional side alive. Pure execution and pressure to get things done, and especially the urge into it, can surely puts the entrepreneurial path into the spiral of death. With that alive and well, then the duty to get things done is an balancing act. It comes, therefore, as a secondary.

Let's move on from the characterizations that unfolds from the tops-down and move into the bottom up aspects that are true and alive in the actual world of entrepreneurs from the beginning. Next, the attempt is not to categorize, or characterize, but to consider aspects and elements that sets one and the team into movement, elements that set them into action in the first place and therefore help us to see that the role of the entrepreneur has more to do with the one awareness of the entrepreneurial process. First, the recognition of their dreams and values. Second, the search for role models. Third pillar, the quest for learning. Logically, there are various other elements that support those who want to embark on entrepreneurship. The main point of the exercise is not to prescribe the right way but to zoom in on the process and recognize that discovery and permission are critical elements for the entrepreneurial journey.

#### From dreams become values 
@meta @Outline
* outline - answer k1.2 - Dreams to values   
--> 

In the context of entrepreneurship, addressing dreams and principles with due importance is essential. The entrepreneurial journey isn't merely a series of actions aimed at profit-making. It's a mission deeply intertwined with dreams, principles, and a defined vision. However, a complication often arises when there's a tendency to minimize or "prune" the wantrepreneur aspect as one transitions into the role of an entrepreneur. This denial may be fueled by a mistaken belief that the realism of entrepreneurship doesn't allow for a high degree of inspiration, romanticism, or that grand visions can be a hindrance to immediate action focused on the market.

This mindset, however, is not only limiting but also counterproductive. The relevant question, therefore, is: how to effectively balance these forces? The answer lies in two fundamental steps. The first is the need to deeply reflect on the dreams and motivations that drive the desire to venture into entrepreneurship, and to identify guiding principles. This is an essential step to reconnect with the original vision and strengthen determination.

The second point to recognize, equally crucial, is to translate these dreams and principles into tangible actions that allow progress without sacrificing core values. In this exercise, we can find inspiration in Jim Collins's work "Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" (1994). Collins emphasizes that "Visionary companies make some of their best moves by experimentation, trial and error, opportunism, and—quite literally—accident. What looks in retrospect like brilliant foresight and preplanning was often the result of 'Let’s just try a lot of stuff and keep what works.'" This perspective encourages a balance between maintaining visionary ideals and engaging in practical, adaptable actions to navigate the unpredictable path of entrepreneurship.

<!--
@meta @references
* Reference - Collins, J. (1994). Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies. Harper Business; 3rd ed. edition.
--> 

Applying this concept to entrepreneurship, we can envision a dynamic where values and vision provide necessary guidance, while at the same time allowing freedom for experimentation and execution. In this way, the vision of the wantrepreneur and the efficacy of the entrepreneur not only coexist but complement each other, enabling a successful and principled entrepreneurial journey.

#### From models become references 
@meta @Outline
* outline - answer k1.3 - From models become references  
--> 

Another aspect that characterizes our path is the relationship with knowledge and the path of entrepreneurship by seeking role models to be inspired by them and to learn with them and how much that sort of interaction turns out to characterize our own models. One way to look at role models is to simply consider that we are taking valuable lessons, our principles, our behaviors. This is because the world of knowledge is documented in this manner, that role models are protagonists carrying ideas and that sets coherent stories and may inspire us. Perhaps looking to role models as a shortcut to retrieve lessons from thoughts and behaviors.


Ray Dalio, a superb role model, has stated that he created a "deck of cards" of knowledge. Because he documented this knowledge in his book "Principles," you wouldn't need to try to contact him and convince him to help you. And this is precisely what Brian Chesky, another model and co-founder of Airbnb, pointed out — that if you achieve success, you could talk with great people who can teach you. But if you haven't achieved success and by that access to successful networks, as was his situation once, the good news is that these role models are in books:

> *"And the cool thing is, the more successful you get, the more you have access to them. But even before you get really successful, you can certainly read about the best. And I also learned from biographies, but I think going to the source [is a good advice.]"* Brian Chesky (Greylock, 2015, 1:23:02) 

The good news is that once you open these doors, we're positioning ourselves hoping to learn with them and creating a prompt to yourself to compare yourself to them. Therefore positioning yourself as a character throughout the journey. Where by reading about their experiences and characters, you're forming your own principles, coming up with your reflections and abstractions that may define your own values and characters. Furthermore, you're welcome to speak to your mind, which may to more or less extent involve talking about your own character.

In addition, we shouldn't miss the point that the accounting and recounting of these stories and their minds through history actually serves as a reference point for us to understand that the perspectives of this role model, those are changing in time. As an example, certainly Brian Chesky from Airbnb is considered as a role model with certain characterizations such as one that embraces continuous learning, one that is able to evolve, recognized by Rick Hoffman as an infinite apprentice, and as an example of a quality that is highlighted as value in a given circumstance in time in history. In other words, role models are changing and because of that, your role model in development changing as well, looking to role models and looking to ourselves and speaking our own minds as part of the process of change.

@meta @Outline
* outline - answer k1.3 - From learning to listening
#### From wanting, to listening, to learning
--> 

Another important element in the initial, or perpetual, journey of the entrepreneur is the issue of learning how to learn. But the theme, properly organized like that, can only the inferred in retrospect - as in reality the interest in learning connects with the willingess to copy from references. An interview with Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, |Reid illustrates how Brian Chesky develops his learning style from a position of humility:  

> *"The term that I use for it is 'infinite learners,' and you're actually one of the people I use as an example. Because literally the very first time you and I did a press event, it was the first time that I had done a press event with an entrepreneur in my portfolio where the very first question you asked me when we got off the stage was 'What should I have done better?'"* Reid Hoffman, (Greylock, 2015, 1:00:04) 

Connected with this idea of the infinite learner is a behavioral element, which is the capacity to listen and seek feedback. Paul Graham, an investor at YCombinator, in his essay titled "Before The Startup," confirms that the capacity to listen is one of the key elements for the success of founders.

> *"Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a predictor of success. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened."* (Graham, 2014)

* reference - Graham, P. (2014). Before the Startup. http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html
--> 

It should be noted that these things that they listen are likely a bit on the side of the actual practical thing that is under what is to be done. The rise of the learner, or the listener, therefore, is likely associated with the self awareness about the role. When Brian used Reid's time to ask "What should I have done better?" he had escaped into the higher-order, the viewpoint from above, looked at his role, and compared with other possible characterizations.  This would perhaps make of Brian a sort of role model that can be comparable with a self-cleaning oven.

--> 


The fact is that all these beings, you call them wantrepreneurs or entrepreneurs, once had to face a path of learning under the conditions of uncertainty. Not only uncertainty about what to do and how to do, but to face uncertainty of the why to do which connects with who they are. The apparent problem is that the distinction doesn't deal with the process, for instance, of those who are beginners still trying to emerge. The real question is whether entrepreneurs start their journey with the goal of becoming entrepreneurs. Can they do that way? Where do things truly begin? In this context, in an interview by Roham Workman, Steve Blank was asked if entrepreneurship can be taught or if people are born with that. Steve openned his answer with his testament of how he and his friends were amuzed to see that he became a practictioner as they assumed that he was "the last guy on the planet that anybody would thought to be a strategist." The answer to the question, which took him about a decade to find, circled back to the question of "Who can entrepreneurship be taught to?" Or that entrepreneurship involves learning, indeed, involves practice, indeed, but also an initial movement, a volunteering intention:  

> *"About 500 years ago, we discovered in the Renaissance, you can actually train artists. First of all, you passionately have to want to be one. You want to be a sculptor or a painter or a musician. And the way you're going to learn is, yeah, we'll teach you some theory, but you're going to apprentice and do it tons of hands on. You're not going to learn how to be a painter by reading painting books."* (Blank, 2014, 10:42)

In the interview, he recognizes a entrepreneur is the one that passionately volunteers to be in, to engage with theory and a ton of practice, and that they develop the craft counting on support from the external environment like through a rich ecossystem like incubators, accelerators, and more.

* outline - Answer k2.2 - Pulling up essentials of vision and getting things done
--> 

An essential component of entrepeneurship - and a quite exciting one - is that all entrepreneurial action involves an initial movement that can be of the romantic kind. I like to think that it has to do with a kind of romantic art [^footnote_romantic_art_ayn_rand] where the doer feels empowered to change the world - or some kind of world anyway. 

[^footnote_romantic_art_ayn_rand]: Ayn Rand's perspective on romantic art emphasizes the division of artistic endeavors into "valid" and "invalid" forms. According to her philosophy, as discussed in Wikipedia, art forms like photography are considered "invalid" because they merely record the world as it is, with limited capacity to convey a moral message beyond the choice of subject matter. Rand believed that art should strive to elevate and idealize the human spirit, aligning with her broader philosophical system that celebrates individualism and heroic potential. 

[^footnote_wikipedia_georgewestinghouse_airbrakes]: George Westinghouse was an American entrepreneur and engineer who invented the railway air brake system. This innovation greatly improved the safety and efficiency of railroads by using compressed air to operate the brakes of trains, allowing them to be stopped more reliably and quickly than before. His invention revolutionized the railroad industry and led to the founding of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company. For more detailed information, visit the Wikipedia page on the Westinghouse Air Brake Company: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Air_Brake_Company. 

Consider the story of Oliver Evans, the american inventor recognized as a protagonist in the history of the high pressure steam engine before - the thing that later found traction in the world of locomotives. He couldn't be around, not enough time, to witness the movement of the heavy weight carrying locomotives, spreading around the United States and producing change by its steady speed and arrival the on-time. And from that, not witnessing the air brakes [^footnote_wikipedia_georgewestinghouse_airbrakes] required to stopped those heavy trains safely and equaly on time. From humble origins and unable to be educated in private schools, in a time when public scholls didn't exist, the young Evans showed an interest to the mechanical things as he apprenticed with a wheelwright. That place might have given him the opportunity to be a resourceful, or hands on, and embrace the role of an inventor that wanted to "get things done" in more automated ways due to the vision he had of a new world. A particular moment was revealled as an epiphany that endured through his life: 

> *"When he was seventeen, a trivial incident drew his attention to what became a lifelong fascination. One of his brothers told him that for fun a friend, the son of a blacksmith, had 'stopped up the touch-hole of a gun-barrel, then put into it about a gill of water, and rammed down a tight wadding. When they put the breech-end of it into the smith's fire, it discharged itself with as loud a crack as if it had been loaded with gunpowder.'"* (Klein, 2009, p. 33)

<!--

That story is documented by Maury Klein as he had referred to that as the moment of an awakening, "It immediately occurred to me that there was a power capable of propelling any waggon, provided that I could apply it; and I set myself to work.to find out the means of doing so"​ (Klein, 2009, p. xx)

--> 

Although romantic it may appear from far, the reality of his days were tough as many regarded his ideas as futile if not ridiculous. According to Maury Klein, he had indicated that he persevered in his beliefs because move on with experiments and confirmation. Still, his journey to get to the point of making a contribution to the high pressure steam engine would take many decades to happen. But in betweem, his hard work involved lots of deliveries applicable to the market needs around him. 

This is a real life of a doer that didn't have any major investment to smooth his way - that happened to be messing up with ideas for a high-pressure steam engine that would only in dreams propel cars and boats that couldn't be done with the materials of the time. But through his journey, coming up with inventions - like the automated mill - that impacted the country's industrial development:  

> *"In 1782 Oliver persuaded his father to sell part of his farm to him and two of his brothers. There Evans erected a prototype mill based on no fewer than five new inventions. As early as 1783 he told several people that he intended to build a mill capable of taking grain from the sack and transforming it into flour withouht any manual labor. No one believed him. By September 1785 Evans had the mill up and running. Other millers saw the advantage of each improvement as it went into service and began using them. Some paid a small royalty to Evans, others did not. Since the new United States government did not yet have a patent law, Evans secured patents from Delaware, Maryland, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania in 1787. When the federal government passed a patent law in 1790, Evans applied for and received U.S. Patent No. 3. One of his first licenses went to none other than George Washington."* (Klein, 2009, p. 34) 

The story of Oliver shows a bit of what it is an entrepreneur because he had embraced the challenges, such as to embrace the inventor following a vision, to access a new world; therefore to access the creative part. In other words, it doesn't disconnect from the Schumpeterian view about the role of entrepreneurs: 

> *"We have seen that the function of entrepreneurs is to reform or revolutionize the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or, more generally, an untried technological possibility for producing a new commodity or producing an old one in a new way, by opening up a new source of supply of materials or a new outlet for products, by reorganizing an industry and so on."* (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

And, on the very same hand is about being a doer, around the world, going through the challenges and acting in the market. And even if it has a romantic and creative twist, it is a story of a doer that keeps messing up with the environment, call it the market or life: 

> *"To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct economic function, first, because they lie outside routine tasks which everybody understands, and secondly, because the environment resists in many ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions with the enterprise exploit. It consists in getting things done."* (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

* outline - Answer k2.3 - Getting things done should seek reinvention and freedom 
--> 

Now has Schumpeter misunderstood the entrepreneur reducing it as the pure doer? No, I would think, exactly because of a premisse that the incessant doer brings about freedom from the current stream, from the way things are done. It other words it is plausiable to think that doing leads to reinvention just like writing every day leads to clear writing. But the very twist lies in the fact that the incessant doer does it by getting things done in ways that breaks stability, or the norm, because if not the acceptance of the equilibrium may also mean that there is not nothing to be done anyway. The view from this perspective, that getting things done means changing the environment, allow us to consider the very Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction although applicable to the individual that does it: the situation that when they see it, and when they feel empowered to act on it, involves them challenge themselves, their conforming selves, the one that would not do anything at all about what frustrates them. In other words, the doer that breaks the norm follows from the necessary challenging of their position of inaction, thus challenging her own status quo, which provokes to bring about change to themselves in the first place and by that they hope to do the same to the external environment, minimally provoking the outside with stories, if not with the materializations of things that carry on their stories further.   

In essence, when seeking the characterizations of opportunity from the spirit of an entrepreneur, we may find an alignment with Steve's viewpoint that they see themselves as entrepreneurs, that they volunteering into it, and by that they are willing to learn while executing the craft and by the execution: 

> *"You're not going to learn how to be a painter by reading painting books."* (Blank, 2014, 10:42)

On from that mode of doing it, that path, there are crossroads and opportunities - to navigate towards the side of status or to navigate by seeking clarity through truths, principles, and values. The biggest risk of seeking status is that this pursuit can greatly hinder learning. Doers can also fall into being arbitrary doers. Arbitrary doers can become stuck too. On the other hand, the always-learning entrepreneur sees themselves as an aspirant first and foremost. Therefore, they seek support, and they want to be, to become; and by doing so, planting that everyday, they see mistakes as learning opportunities. Through the development of an entrepreneur - and some of its characterizations could be identified by the ones tagging wantrepreneurs - the may be working on a message, like the David Ogilvy brilliantly  "the best way to increase the sales of a product is to improve the product" (Ogilvy, 1983, our translation). So be it, if you are projecting yourself, exercising your aspiration, and navigating the space that could be called wantrepreneur, remember that this is your chance to improve yourself.

So, if you are projecting yourself, exercising your expirations and being open about who you are and what you're doing, you're therefore navigating the space that can be called a one entrepreneur. And that, if you see it from the optics that you're a learner, that you're allowing yourself to learn and respecting yourself about your mistakes, you are giving yourself the chance to improve. Furthermore, if you find your way to be always a one entrepreneur while doing it, you're likely setting yourself out of the know-it-all situation, which is extremely dangerous.

But it wasn't until I read *Becoming a Writer*, that I could find yet another essential observation of the entrepreneur. From *False and Real Artists*, Dorothea Brande brings about the essential grain that explains the flash of genius: 

> *"the ready sensitiveness, of a child, the 'innocence of eye' that means so much to the painter, the ability to respond freshly and quickly to new scenes, and the old scenes as though they were new; to see traits and characteristics as though they were new-minted from God instead of sorting them quickly into dusty categories and pigeonholing them without wonder or surprise; to feel situations so immediately and keely that the word 'trite' as hardly any meaning for him; and always to see 'the correspondence between things' of which Aristotle spoke two thousand years ago. This freshness of resopnse is vital to the author's talent."* Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)

And that it is - same for the writer-author, same for the artist-author, and the same for the entrepreneur-author. That element supports the real entrepreneur even if that is a vision because they see 'the correspondence between things' through that sensitiveness or the 'essence of eye.' 

By reflecting on these words, it immediately ocurred to me that, and again, there he stood, the character of Oliver Evans, keeping up with that essence of eye of an incessantly kept seing the correspondence between things through his lifelong journey of getting things done. What has new to him when he was seventeen started to be clear 40 years later when he wrote: 

> *"The time will come when people will travel in stages moved by steam engines from one city to another almost as fast as birds fly - fifteen to twenty miles an hour. Passing through the air with such velocity - changing the scenes in such rapid succession - will be the most exhilarating, delightful exercise. A carriage will set out from Washington in the morning, and the passengers will breakfast at Baltimore, dine in Philadelphia, and sup at New York the same day."* 

So he moved from "It immediatelly occured to me," in 1772 to "The time will come," in 1812 to then making high-pressure steam engines in xxxx. Now, through the consideration of Oliver's life as an inventor and doer we can minimally arrive at the observation of a balance betweem getting things done and the sensitive self. But his life is also a lesson to keep in mind that all of that has nothing to do with achieving success from other measuments, such as financial success, or healthy, or happuness. Oliver kept doing but had a tough path through his jorney, especially being that he believed that the patent system would give him protection but gave him nightmares and a situation of being overwhelmed [^footnote_maury_klein_oliver_patents_hell].
