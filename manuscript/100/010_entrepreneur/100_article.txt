# Accounting 

As our world becomes automated, or artificially intelligent, or smarted in non-organic ways, one of the predictions I have seen is that the profession of the accountant will go away. That says that accounting, as in accounting of a business, can be done by a machine or a system. This seems to be the case, and it is observable, because certain functions of accounting are taken by these systems. So it may be apparently and I think too fast that it's a bad news for accountants and a good news for people in general, because people don't have to bother with the details of accounting which they don't like, for the potential sadness of accountants that will not have customers. But it may be so, under a calmer reflection, that it's the other way around, that it's bad news for people and good news for accountants. Because now people are involved in online systems that then calculate and count things for them, prompting them to not think through and not understand the principles. On the other hand, accountants are now so valuable because they do understand the other parts, the actual principles.

A partial conclusion must be in place, that what we see in terms of these systems is just the beginning, that if they do mostly the calculating parts, things that calculators do, that although simple, it means that we value so much accounting intrinsically, and that is the very reason to look at the principles of accounting, or to guide us by certain principles of accounting that needs to be present at any situation. In terms of principles, I think it may be difficult to see the values, exactly because the more we automate and put into our lives that version of accounting that is indeed invaluable to count and recount, the more for some of us it may take us to take it for granted. Moreover, it may take us to misunderstand the points and the principles. If I am to compare, going back to the principles of accounting, I like to think of classical music and what Benjamin Zander, the author of *The Art of Possibility*, has to say about classical music. He does acknowledge that really few people get it or loves classical music, as in 1.6%. But in his talk, *The Transformative Power of Classical Music*, he guarantees to all of his audience that they will love classical music and that they haven't seen nothing yet. I think that we if look at the roots of accounting, it is no different. Really few people will see the principles but if we look at it we may embrace the transformative power - we haven't seen nothing yet.

Our complication, our way, may have to do with the fact that we take it for granted or, in other words, that we just jump to dance by the beat of music, not recognizing being sensible of all the principles and fundamental values of accounting. Does it take us when we engage with in many circumstances to count the things by the sake of counting and such as to use the metrics of our days as vanity metrics and to engage with the number that don't matter - in fact in terms of - strategyfor our future; which may furthermore harm our ways. 

Throughout the next three sections, we will be guided principles of accounting that can serve us for the long run, we will respect ourselves, respect our energy and time, and with that, reflect about the meaning of success. In other words, we can't move on without being able to count and recount from the history of our own movement what matters, which is the reference situation to create abstractions, to reflect and evolve, and to revisit and understand what matters. Let us start with us.

* Abstract - In the realm of entrepreneurship, the concept of a "wantrepreneur" emerges as a cautionary term used to describe individuals who express a desire to become entrepreneurs but fail to take decisive steps to materialize their ambitions. This reflection delves into the significance of dreams and values, highlighting the importance of striking a balance between inspiration and realism in the entrepreneurial journey. It also emphasizes the value of role models as a source of guidance and motivation. Furthermore, being an eternal learner and seeking feedback are key elements that contribute to an entrepreneur's growth and success. By navigating this path consciously and embracing the identity of a perpetual learner, aspiring entrepreneurs can transform aspirations into tangible achievements and truly embrace the entrepreneurial spirit.

From the world of entrepreneurship, there are many people passing on recipes about what to do, the right way, and what not to do, the wrong way. They are unstoppable - no matter how far they are - and it is part of their craft that they keep doing and that they keep sharing and telling us what they do, how they do, and who they are. From my own journey, through hopes and hopping through what they say, and recipes, one in particular has hit my board. This arrow was labeled *Wantrepreneur*. 

<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - Introduction - Situation - Definition from my experience, caught, and can't deny, seems reasonable. 
--> 

*Wantrepreneur*, which seems to be in English, is a term that may or not come your way, but it came my way. It refers to someone who pretends, who seeks status, as an entrepreneur, as opposed to focusing in execution work which really makes one to become. This definition is not evil, in fact, it comes with good intentions by them who think of themselves as entrepreneurs, therefore intended to help these others on their way. Their alert serves a potential purpose to help with the entrepreneur's destiny? Maybe, where not the status has to be pursued but the action of entrepreneurship, which aims for results, which demands impact. Well, what could one say if not to nod under the idea that there is nothing too wrong with that. When revising this section, I asked ChatGPT, what is wantrepreneur?

<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - Introduction - Situation - Pejorative in many ways, definition. 
--> 

> *"Wantrepreneur is a pejorative term used to describe someone who talks about starting a business but never takes concrete steps to make it a reality. In other words, it's someone who 'wants' to be an entrepreneur but doesn't act as one. A wantrepreneur may spend a lot of time reading about business, watching lectures, or taking courses, but they never actually start their own venture. They may have many ideas but don't act on them or execute them. Often, these individuals may be more in love with the idea of being entrepreneurs than with the reality of working hard to build and manage a business. The term is often used to emphasize the importance of action and execution as opposed to mere contemplation or speculation in the entrepreneurial journey."* ChatGPT

* outline - Introduction - Complication - Not confusing? Yet another story. Wait,  
--> 


Now, if we extract the positive tone by these voices, we will certainly recognize that they are trying to help and to avoid the potential toxic state of the one who dives to the bottom of the ocean to a place of merely status and never engage with it to make the entrepreneurial action to happen, never rise to the surface. They're right, again, it's not evil. Furthermore, the point about bringing one entrepreneur is that this may be an example of something that flows with the whole conversation through the ecosystems of entrepreneurs, so you may see this perhaps given by other variations and voices essentially, again, calling for action. Now, just like going straight to status is a problem, it may be worth for the common reflection about when we hear the voices that cause us to jump to get things done as a sort of status as well. Because the problem is not with the actual true content that is being written somewhere, if one had the time to read. Certainly the good messages are in there, as we know, in the networked world and fast-paced world. The labels are the arrows are actually being thrown. And it pulls us to react. And to react quick. The complication from there is a potential of one that jumps to get things done by missing the point of a conscious reflection about the character of the entrepreneur. Certainly a character of one who wants to be that goes along with one who does it.

Now, if that's one thing, there's an even more important complication from there, which is that they may actually not only deprioritize that kind of a supposedly toxic focus, by embracing another tone or another way of operating, which is to execute and to do things first or to follow the right way in the face of getting things done. Furthermore, that execution, which may inevitably take them into problems, may create further complications for them, not only because of the detachment from themselves, but also because of surprising frustrations from execution. In other words, the complication is that it does deal with the process, for instance, for those who are beginners and trying to emerge.

@meta @Outline
* outline - Introduction - Question and Answer - (Elaborate) Breaking down - Can it be taught?  
--> 

The real question is whether entrepreneurs start their journey with the goal of becoming entrepreneurs without being entrepreneurs. Can they do that way? Moreover, can they start entrepreneurship based on motivations, based on inspirations such as when inspired by successful entrepreneur models? Also, is wanting to be an entrepreneur a valid destination? Currently, yes, the entrepreneur can and should want to be, can and should desire to pursue dreams, can and should be inspired by examples, can and should express his ideas out. Indeed, they risk falling into the abyss and staying there at the bottom of the entrepreneurship ocean, somewhat conversing with model entities, learning, and experiencing the wonders of the romantic world of entrepreneurship. While exiting the abyss, rising to the surface, is important - as no one denies the fruit of entrepreneurship is changing the environment - still, the great complication of negatively labeling the wantrepreneur lies in the small chance of the protagonist going directly to a supposed successful execution, a supposed act of delivering results.







In summary, we can't say that the wantrepreneur role has to be redefined. We shouldn't bother with specifics from ideas that aren't clear yet; and we can do better by turning our attention to the what matters, such as to consider the actual path of development and the actual considerations that characterizes the entrepreneur in development.

--> 

### The pathways

It used to be the case that entrepreneurs were forged by an environment, such as the place where they lived through challenges firt hand, where some of them raised alone to change their environment and their lifes, and some others had the opportunity to be educated, such as doing the craft like apprentice, and others found ways to have their journey smoothed in a way, with protection like investment. We can go into history of the industrial revolution looking for the inventor's role, it becomes vivid how the environment where a ground for change.  

But nowadays, althought sometimes the learning path seems quite structured, there is an abundance of far too many pathways that seem to be the right way to go, it becomes structured and unestructured by the abundance, by the excess of stories, recipes, methods, advice, systems, networks, platforms - ideas being exchanged. What were more of an entrepreneurial framework by a forceful environment became what seems to be yet another way of working. That, in a way, seems like good news, many more are able to get into what they can see as an entrepreneurial pathway, if they want. As in, the entrance points have indeed exploded and with that the exit points too happen to reflect the input.  Through modern, and oftenly confusing pathways, one pattern common is to move up the ladder with advice which many may even see these elements like building blocks. Navihating with that seems to be Right or Wrong, it is not easy as the dynamic environment is far from the problem of the blank canvas. Nowadays, these elements on the way of entrepreneurs are quite interactive, and iterative, more like a drawing that is initiated and where you have to complete or to color it. It provoke us to fill the blanks, to play the game.

#### Too reactive 
@meta @outline
*outline - answer - Self attack and prep work for the toxic   
--> 

It would appear to not be harmful, especially for the stronger kind that has confidence in its path, the encounter with the voices and characterizations of an *Wantrepreneur*. From an optimistic view, it's for good; it means no harm. And it a warning sign, a sign of advice, and it is emblematic and hopes to adds perhaps a good level of pressure, for the good of entrepreneurs. But the dangers of these attacks will only happens for the one in the aspirant stage, while under construction, in the wanting list and willing to do so, in the line to become and embracing the spirit of an entrepreneur, even before they can deliver, act, and execute. Now, a consideration has to be made that such attack is a social construction. In other words, the formation of the idea *Wantrepreneur* becomes critical by a self attack instead of any specific work of art of one or other that had written about it. After all, if anything is out there it all exists as part of the very same mechanism of learning where they learning by writing, by giving out advices, by claiming to be entrepreneurs even if the claim sounds a bit convolucted in nature when they express their wants to be by referring to the wants to be. 

But it finds its way into being harmful by the very usage, like a meme, and within the urgent ecosystem. Therefore, the attack flies arbitrarily and unfortunatelly by the nature of half-words of mouth, or echoes of a hopefuly more elaborated though, misses the small letters if any of the actual articles had it. It becomes, therefore, dangerous not by the actual content that once have been written by one or other that came up with that fusion of words if any of that had brought arguments and nuances. It becomes dangerous by the narrative created by the reader, the entrepreneur that reads it too quick and may then miss the reflection and take the noun as an arrow into the chest and work out their way in binary arrays either to criticize themselves too hard or to on the other side work too hard into execution missing that the value lies in the middle. When the aspiring entrepreneur gets that arrow, the only label they see is an urge to flip her character towards being the being that gets things done, in a hurry. The risk of moving too quick from wanting to be into getting things done might be, in itself, the movement of real desperation, under the flames, might be the movement of really wanting, but in the end can becomme a delusional movement supported by an arrogant simplification that getting things done is of higher importance than the things related to wanting to be an entrepreneur. 

<!--
@outline - That who voices for gettinng things done has noticed?
-->

But let's face it, it's easy to be articulated by those who have made it after they have failed before achieving status of true entrepreneurs. It's these individuals, which claim themselves to be right side of character, which now feel empowered to pass on their recipes, now feeling that they raise these warning signs. They claim, so, don't be a wantrepreneur, don't write, don't claim to be, don't communicate much or get into the wanting context. Now, there are two other characteristic potential problems with the characterization of one who focuses on getting things done and promotes that as the only way. The first is that they might actually by doing so, if they achieve success and set themselves in a space where they're essentially locked themselves, in other words, they're unable to go back to that stage of wanting to be, or perhaps the vulnerable condition before the one who wants, which is the healthier version of the one who learns from wanting to be. The other aspect to be considered is that by the potential over-focusing getting things done, the potential engagement in trial and error, therefore missing the points about the learning that precedes execution and the changes of character that precedes execution.


<!--
@outline - question - 
-->

Therefore, in other words, this entrepreneur in development, which might be yet weak, or some of its emotional being part might be affected by attacks, can hesitate to move in the right track? If so, then, it is then important for them to keep an eye on these attacks - or the self attack - that actually gets in the way and makes them either stuck, like blocked, or into the getting things done to fit the world as expected, and by driving its steps by the criticism of execution oriented to the external perspectives about what means execution that they find themselves in their way to be, again, blocked, to die slowly, to interrupt. Therefore, the point of establishing a careful consideration for potential attacks is mainly to preserve the executor of your entrepreneurial path. Keeping it alive and well. See, execution and getting things done has a duty which is the duty to bring about the changes sought which will require to bring about the changes of development of the self, the team, the organization. The path to get there has to involve the establishment of a healthy path and the healthy path should take care of the innocent movement, should preserve the sensitive side, and the emotional side alive. Pure execution and pressure to get things done, and especially the urge into it, can surely puts the entrepreneurial path into the spiral of death. With that alive and well, then the duty to get things done is an balancing act. It comes, therefore, as a secondary.

Let's move on from the characterizations that unfolds from the tops-down and move into the bottom up aspects that are true and alive in the actual world of entrepreneurs from the beginning. Next, the attempt is not to categorize, or define, but to consider aspects and elements that sets one and the team into movement, elements that set them into action in the first place and therefore help us to see that the role of the entrepreneur has more to do with the one awareness of the entrepreneurial process. First, the recognition of their dreams and values. Second, the search for role models. And third, the realization of a characterization of a learner. Logically, there are various other elements that support those who want to embark on entrepreneurship. The main point of the exercise is not to prescribe the right way but to zoom in on the process and recognize that discovery and permission are critical elements for the entrepreneurial journey.





#### From romantic notions to principles 

<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - answer k1.2 - Dreams to values   
--> 

In the context of entrepreneurship, addressing dreams and principles with due importance is essential. The entrepreneurial journey isn't merely a series of actions aimed at profit-making. It's a mission deeply intertwined with dreams, principles, and a defined vision. However, a complication often arises when there's a tendency to minimize or "prune" the wantrepreneur aspect as one transitions into the role of an entrepreneur. This denial may be fueled by a mistaken belief that in reality entrepreneurship doesn't start with inspirations, romantic notions, or visions, and further and the quest for understanding who you are. Yes it is not clear but the difficulty should't mean that the answers must be a denial to this understanding. 

This mindset, however, is not only limiting but also counterproductive. The relevant question, therefore, is: how to effectively balance these forces? The answer lies in two fundamental steps. The first is the need to reflect on the dreams and motivations that drive the desire to venture into entrepreneurship, and to identify guiding principles. This is an essential step to reconnect with the original vision and strengthen determination.

The second point involved recognizing the work of translating - not ignoring - from these dreams, or values, or motivations, or inspirations, turning into tangible actions; which will allow for understanding them as principles. In other words, to enable the origins of the clarity work, or quest, where progress happens from a core, not by sacrificing core values. In this exercise, we can find inspiration in Jim Collins's work "Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" (1994). Collins emphasizes that "Visionary companies make some of their best moves by experimentation, trial and error, opportunism, and—quite literally—accident. What looks in retrospect like brilliant foresight and preplanning was often the result of 'Let’s just try a lot of stuff and keep what works.'" This perspective encourages a balance between maintaining visionary ideals and engaging in practical, adaptable actions to navigate the unpredictable path of entrepreneurship.

<!--
@meta @references
* Reference - Collins, J. (1994). Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies. Harper Business; 3rd ed. edition.
--> 

Applying this concept to entrepreneurship, we can envision a dynamic where values and vision provide necessary guidance, while at the same time allowing freedom for experimentation and execution. In this way, the vision of the wantrepreneur and the efficacy of the entrepreneur not only coexist but complement each other, enabling a successful and principled entrepreneurial journey.










#### From models to modeling 

<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - answer k1.3 - From models become references  
--> 

Another aspect that characterizes our path is the relationship with knowledge and the path of entrepreneurship by seeking role models to be inspired by them and to learn with them and how much that sort of interaction turns out to characterize our own models. One way to look at role models is to simply consider that we are taking valuable lessons, our principles, our behaviors. This is because the world of knowledge is documented in this manner, that role models are protagonists carrying ideas and that sets coherent stories and may inspire us. Perhaps looking to role models as a shortcut to retrieve lessons from thoughts and behaviors.

Ray Dalio, a superb role model, has stated that he created a "deck of cards" of knowledge. Because he documented this knowledge in his book "Principles," you wouldn't need to try to contact him and convince him to help you. And this is precisely what Brian Chesky, another model and co-founder of Airbnb, pointed out — that if you achieve success, you could talk with great people who can teach you. But if you haven't achieved success and by that access to successful networks, as was his situation once, the good news is that these role models are in books:

> *"And the cool thing is, the more successful you get, the more you have access to them. But even before you get really successful, you can certainly read about the best. And I also learned from biographies, but I think going to the source [is a good advice.]"* Brian Chesky (Greylock, 2015, 1:23:02) 

The good news is that once you open these doors, we're positioning ourselves hoping to learn with them and creating a prompt to yourself to compare yourself to them. Therefore positioning yourself as a character throughout the journey. Where by reading about their experiences and characters, you're forming your own principles, coming up with your reflections and abstractions that may define your own values and characters. Furthermore, you're welcome to speak to your mind, which may to more or less extent involve talking about your own character.

In addition, we shouldn't miss the point that the accounting and recounting of these stories and their minds through history actually serves as a reference point for us to understand that the perspectives of this role model, those are changing in time. As an example, certainly Brian Chesky from Airbnb is considered as a role model with certain characterizations such as one that embraces continuous learning, one that is able to evolve, recognized by Rick Hoffman as an infinite apprentice, and as an example of a quality that is highlighted as value in a given circumstance in time in history. In other words, role models are changing and because of that, your role model in development changing as well, looking to role models and looking to ourselves and speaking our own minds as part of the process of change.







#### From wanting to listen to listening 

<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - answer k1.3 - From learning to listening
--> 

Another important element in the initial, or perpetual, journey of the entrepreneur is the issue of learning how to learn. But the theme, properly organized like that, can only the inferred in retrospect - as in reality the interest in learning connects with the willingess to copy from references. An interview with Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, |Reid illustrates how Brian Chesky develops his learning style from a position of humility:  

> *"The term that I use for it is 'infinite learners,' and you're actually one of the people I use as an example. Because literally the very first time you and I did a press event, it was the first time that I had done a press event with an entrepreneur in my portfolio where the very first question you asked me when we got off the stage was 'What should I have done better?'"* Reid Hoffman, (Greylock, 2015, 1:00:04) 

Connected with this idea of the infinite learner is a behavioral element, which is the capacity to listen and seek feedback. Paul Graham, an investor at YCombinator, in his essay titled "Before The Startup," confirms that the capacity to listen is one of the key elements for the success of founders.

> *"Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a predictor of success. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened."* (Graham, 2014)

--> 

It should be noted that these things that they listen are likely a bit on the side of the actual practical thing that is under what is to be done. The rise of the learner, or the listener, therefore, is likely associated with the self awareness about a role. When Brian used Reid's time to ask "What should I have done better?" he had escaped into that space, a view from above, looking at his role, and checking the well-being of the role against important characterizations. As a model, I can see Brian as a self-cleaning oven.







### The essential entrepreneur

@meta @Outline
* outline - Answer k2.1 - Can entrepreneurship be taught? 
--> 


The fact is that all these beings, you call them wantrepreneurs or entrepreneurs, once had to face a path of learning under the conditions of uncertainty. Not only uncertainty about what to do and how to do, but to face uncertainty of the why to do which connects with who they are. The apparent problem is that the distinction doesn't deal with the process, for instance, of those who are beginners still trying to emerge. The real question is whether entrepreneurs start their journey with the goal of becoming entrepreneurs. Can they do that way? Where do things truly begin? In this context, in an interview by Roham Workman, Steve Blank was asked if entrepreneurship can be taught or if people are born with that. Steve openned his answer with his testament of how he and his friends were amuzed to see that he became a practictioner as they assumed that he was "the last guy on the planet that anybody would thought to be a strategist." The answer to the question, which took him about a decade to find, circled back to the question of "Who can entrepreneurship be taught to?" Or that entrepreneurship involves learning, indeed, involves practice, indeed, but also an initial movement, a volunteering intention:  

> *"About 500 years ago, we discovered in the Renaissance, you can actually train artists. First of all, you passionately have to want to be one. You want to be a sculptor or a painter or a musician. And the way you're going to learn is, yeah, we'll teach you some theory, but you're going to apprentice and do it tons of hands on. You're not going to learn how to be a painter by reading painting books."* (Blank, 2014, 10:42)

In the interview, he recognizes a entrepreneur is the one that passionately volunteers to be in, to engage with theory and a ton of practice, and that they develop the craft counting on support from the external environment like through a rich ecossystem like incubators, accelerators, and more. An essential component of entrepeneurship - and a quite exciting one - is that all entrepreneurial action involves an initial movement that can be of the romantic kind. Here we are trying to be sensible to the fact that the thing we aim to do, which we may think we love it so hard, as in the tool, is the actual thing we are going for. This is where the idea of romantic art [^footnote_romantic_art_ayn_rand] comes handy, because it sets the protagonist that has core needs, one may feel empowered to change the world - or some kind of world anyway - but essentially this one is discovering the self as one who is meaningful, who serves for something in the world, through its creations or ideas or values and by putting in practice.  

[^footnote_romantic_art_ayn_rand]: Ayn Rand's perspective on romantic art emphasizes the division of artistic endeavors into "valid" and "invalid" forms. According to her philosophy, as discussed in Wikipedia, art forms like photography are considered "invalid" because they merely record the world as it is, with limited capacity to convey a moral message beyond the choice of subject matter. Rand believed that art should strive to elevate and idealize the human spirit, aligning with her broader philosophical system that celebrates individualism and heroic potential.

Consider the story of Oliver Evans, the american inventor recognized as a protagonist in the history of the high pressure steam engine before - the thing that later found traction in the world of locomotives. He couldn't be around, not enough time, to witness the movement of the heavy weight carrying locomotives, spreading around the United States and producing change by its steady speed and arrival the on-time. And from that, not witnessing the air brakes [^footnote_wikipedia_georgewestinghouse_airbrakes] required to stopped those heavy trains safely and equaly on time. From humble origins and unable to be educated in private schools, in a time when public scholls didn't exist, the young Evans showed an interest to the mechanical things as he apprenticed with a wheelwright. That place might have given him the opportunity to be a resourceful, or hands on, and embrace the role of an inventor that wanted to "get things done" in more automated ways due to the vision he had of a new world. A particular moment was revealled as an epiphany that endured through his life: 

[^footnote_wikipedia_georgewestinghouse_airbrakes]: George Westinghouse was an American entrepreneur and engineer who invented the railway air brake system. This innovation greatly improved the safety and efficiency of railroads by using compressed air to operate the brakes of trains, allowing them to be stopped more reliably and quickly than before. His invention revolutionized the railroad industry and led to the founding of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company. For more detailed information, visit the Wikipedia page on the Westinghouse Air Brake Company: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Air_Brake_Company. 


> *"When he was seventeen, a trivial incident drew his attention to what became a lifelong fascination. One of his brothers told him that for fun a friend, the son of a blacksmith, had 'stopped up the touch-hole of a gun-barrel, then put into it about a gill of water, and rammed down a tight wadding. When they put the breech-end of it into the smith's fire, it discharged itself with as loud a crack as if it had been loaded with gunpowder.'"* (Klein, 2009, p. 33)

Although romantic it may appear from far, the reality of his days were tough as many regarded his ideas as futile if not ridiculous. Now, before we go on, something that it didn't immediatelly occured to me but when editing here it did, would be perhaps one's intention to look at a weapon and to look at its potential for doing a better good than to kill people. For me that could, for lack of a better word, wildly romantic. According to Maury Klein, he had indicated that he persevered in his beliefs because move on with experiments and confirmation. Still, his journey to get to the point of making a contribution to the high pressure steam engine would take many decades to happen. But in betweem, his hard work involved lots of deliveries applicable to the market needs around him. This is a real life of a doer that didn't have any major investment to smooth his way - that happened to be messing up with ideas for a high-pressure steam engine that would only in dreams propel cars and boats that couldn't be done with the materials of the time. But through his journey, coming up with inventions - like the automated mill - that impacted the country's industrial development:  

> *"In 1782 Oliver persuaded his father to sell part of his farm to him and two of his brothers. There Evans erected a prototype mill based on no fewer than five new inventions. As early as 1783 he told several people that he intended to build a mill capable of taking grain from the sack and transforming it into flour withouht any manual labor. No one believed him. By September 1785 Evans had the mill up and running. Other millers saw the advantage of each improvement as it went into service and began using them. Some paid a small royalty to Evans, others did not. Since the new United States government did not yet have a patent law, Evans secured patents from Delaware, Maryland, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania in 1787. When the federal government passed a patent law in 1790, Evans applied for and received U.S. Patent No. 3. One of his first licenses went to none other than George Washington."* (Klein, 2009, p. 34) 

The story of Oliver shows a bit of what it is an entrepreneur because he had embraced the challenges, such as to embrace the inventor following a vision, to access a new world; therefore to access the creative part. In other words, it doesn't disconnect from the Schumpeterian view about the role of entrepreneurs: 

> *"We have seen that the function of entrepreneurs is to reform or revolutionize the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or, more generally, an untried technological possibility for producing a new commodity or producing an old one in a new way, by opening up a new source of supply of materials or a new outlet for products, by reorganizing an industry and so on."* (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

And, on the very same hand is about being a doer, around the world, going through the challenges and acting in the market. And even if it has a romantic and creative twist, it is a story of a doer that keeps messing up with the environment, call it the market or life: 

> *"To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct economic function, first, because they lie outside routine tasks which everybody understands, and secondly, because the environment resists in many ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions with the enterprise exploit. It consists in getting things done."* (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

* outline - Answer k2.3 - Getting things done should seek reinvention and freedom 
--> 

I have asked myself if Schumpeter had reduced, then, the role as of a simple doer? No, I would think that doing leads to reinvention just like writing leads to clear writing. But the very twist lies in the fact that the incessant doer does it by getting things done in ways that breaks stability, or the norm, because if not the acceptance of the equilibrium may also mean that there is not nothing to be done anyway. The premisse that an incessant movement of getting things done by doers would imply in breaking the norm, to bring about freedom from the current, from the way things are done; as markets and economic systems tend to equilibrium; thus breaking the equilibrium. The view from this perspective, that getting things done means changing the environment, allow us to consider the very Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction although applicable to the individual that does it: the situation that when they see it, and when they feel empowered to act on it, involves them challenge themselves, their conforming selves, the one that would not do anything at all about what frustrates them. In other words, the doer that breaks the norm follows from the necessity of challenging their position of inaction, thus challenging her own status quo, which provokes to bring about change to themselves in the first place and by that they hope to do the same to the external environment, minimally provoking the outside with stories, if not with the stotries materialized of things that carry on their stories further.   

In essence, when seeking the characterizations of opportunity from the spirit of an entrepreneur, we may find an alignment with Steve's viewpoint that they see themselves as entrepreneurs, that they volunteering into it, and by that they are willing to learn while executing the craft and by the execution: 

> *"You're not going to learn how to be a painter by reading painting books."* (Blank, 2014, 10:42)

On from that mode of doing it, that path, there are crossroads and opportunities - to navigate towards the side of status or to navigate seeking clarity about principles, and values, and by seeking clarity about the self. Acquisition of status, to some certain, might be part of the equation, the reflection of where you are; but locking in a stage can hinder learning. Arbitrary doers can become stuck too. On the other hand, the always-learning entrepreneur sees themselves as an aspirant first and foremost. Therefore, they seek support and as they want to be to become; and by doing so, by seeding everyday, they learn about seeding. Looking to the core, ourselves, is key to help our ideas and our startup, just like improving the product is key to help with marketing messages. To the marketing message, David Ogilvy the God of advertising had put it brilliantly, that "the best way to increase the sales of a product is to improve the product." (Ogilvy, 1983, our translation). So be it, if you are projecting yourself, exercising your aspiration, and navigating the space that could be called wantrepreneur, remember that this is your chance to improve yourself. So, if you are projecting yourself, exercising your expirations and being open about who you are and what you're doing, you're therefore navigating the space that can be called a one entrepreneur. And that, if you see it from the optics that you're a learner, that you're allowing yourself to learn and respecting yourself about your mistakes, you are giving yourself the chance to improve. Furthermore, if you find your way to be always a one entrepreneur while doing it, you're likely setting yourself out of the know-it-all situation, which is extremely dangerous.

But it wasn't until I read *Becoming a Writer*, that I could find yet another essential observation of the entrepreneur. From *False and Real Artists*, Dorothea Brande brings about the essential grain that explains the flash of genius: 

> *"The ready sensitiveness, of a child, the 'innocence of eye' that means so much to the painter, the ability to respond freshly and quickly to new scenes, and the old scenes as though they were new; to see traits and characteristics as though they were new-minted from God instead of sorting them quickly into dusty categories and pigeonholing them without wonder or surprise; to feel situations so immediately and keely that the word 'trite' as hardly any meaning for him; and always to see 'the correspondence between things' of which Aristotle spoke two thousand years ago. This freshness of resopnse is vital to the author's talent."* Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)

And that it is - same for the writer-author, same for the artist-author, and the same for the entrepreneur-author. That element supports the real entrepreneur even if that is a vision because they see 'the correspondence between things' through that sensitiveness or the 'essence of eye.' By reflecting on these words, it immediately occurred to me that, and again, there he stood, the character of Oliver Evans, keeping up with that essence of eye of an incessantly kept seing the correspondence between things through his lifelong journey of getting things done: 

> *"The time will come when people will travel in stages moved by steam engines from one city to another almost as fast as birds fly - fifteen to twenty miles an hour. Passing through the air with such velocity - changing the scenes in such rapid succession - will be the most exhilarating, delightful exercise. A carriage will set out from Washington in the morning, and the passengers will breakfast at Baltimore, dine in Philadelphia, and sup at New York the same day."* 

So Evans moved from "It immediatelly occured to me," in 1772 to "The time will come," in 1812 to then making high-pressure steam engines in xxxx. Now, through the consideration of Oliver's life as an inventor and doer we can minimally arrive at the observation of a balance betweem getting things done and the sensitive self. But his life is also a lesson to keep in mind that all of that has nothing to do with achieving success from other measuments, such as financial success, or healthy, or happiness. Oliver kept doing but had a tough path through his jorney, especially being that he believed that the patent system would give him protection but gave him nightmares and a situation of being overwhelmed [^footnote_maury_klein_oliver_patents_hell].
