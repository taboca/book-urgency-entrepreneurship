* @todo - p1 ( ) - Strategic - In Success -  The following quote is from Dorothea Brandy from 1936, page 14, of Wake Up and live, there is a concept which may be applicable to the section Success: "Now this is something which we seldom see at once. Because we commonly think of failure as the conventional opposite of success, we continue to make false antithesis of the qualities which attend success and failure. Success is bracing, active, alert; so the typical attitude of failure, we believe, must be lethargy, inertia, a supine position. True enough; but that does not mean that no energy is being used. Let any psychologist tell you how much energy a mature person must expend to resist motion. A powerful struggle must be waged against the forces of life and movement in order to remain inert, although this struggle takes place so far beneath the surface of our lives that we do not always become aware of it. Physical inaction is no true sign that life-force is not being burned away. So even the idler is using fuel while they dream." (Brande, Dorothea., 2014/1936, p.14) @meta-refid 1212-2323-8838-4848

## Beyond success 

Pursuing success became a choice, to some extent, optional, from the days of the knowledge worker [^footnote_peterdrucker_success_pursuing], different from the past where the pursuit for success wasn't an option and our working lives were essentially a work of survival. So may be it, that we went from survival, to working for survival or surviving through work, to working consciouslly trying to obtain success. This line of evolution, to some extent consists of the being that is intentionally aiming success, while working. And there is a great deal of logic there, such as that if you have success you can be safe for trying the new, experiment, and from the entrepreneurial view that you can too aim for higher returns from explorations. 

[^footnote_peterdrucker_success_pursuing]: Peter Drucker, in *Managing Oneself* (2008), articulated that historically, success was not viewed as an option; and that the expectation for success came about from the knowledge workers in society. 

Now to be enrolled with this affairs may also be characteristically with the entrepreneurial function. So we should account in this context that work towards success, as in intentionality for success, that to be aware of the action aiming success (and with that the potentiality of failure) is present in the startup situation, as in present and observable, by the conversations from the philosophical level to the the conversations happening through collaboration in the day by day, and by the hour. This level of awareness, such as awareness to measure success, is also observable if we consider lean methods; thus it is fair to take that the job of an entrepreneur which involves trial and error, for the sake of learning or validating, and through its efforts of discovery, is seen as a work in the sense of business as usual.

@outline - situation
--> 


In our hurry to operationalize success - by interaction with the tools and methods and through the social fabric - we also are acquainted with the world of distrations and other complications. In other words, we know that we can burn energy through the journey and we know that some of these interactions may push us away from success. We not only run the risk of not accepting mistakes,  we set ourselves to learn less from mistakes, we become less creative, and more controllers, in the face of the need to adapt, given the challenges ahead. Withing the work space, from that, we may have created or discovered too some intermediary situations of stresss from our lack of control in the face of our attempts to control. Maybe in the days or pure survival, it would be live or die; and in our days in the face of little successes, it may be about gain rewards or gain anxiety or other forms of debits. Of course, we know and we have higher hopes, for learning along the way. But we may not know, not entirely, of the need to control the being that comes before - success for the underlying well-being of the being which we aim to become. 

Now, a complication arises from the situation, because given that we can opt-in, as in, intentionally, into an entrepreneurial effort, and essentially that we give to us permission to do the work, which is fine, it doesn't look like a problem. But it comes with that, from the moment when we act, through failures and errors, these failures and errors might affect the fundamental structure in the sense of the well-being that sustains us through the entrepreneurial effort. Peter Drucker, the father of the adminstration [^druckerfatheradm], brought up the subject of winning, or seeking success, as part of his article entitled Managing Oneself; first pointing that pursuing success was created, and then setting us into the potential problem from the new situation, of trying to control:  

[^druckerfatheradm]: 

> *"In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. Historically, there was no such thing as "success." The overwhelming majority of people did not expect anything but to stay in their "proper station," as an old English prayer has it. The only mobility was downward mobility. In a knowledge society, however, we expect everyone to be a success. This is clearly an impossibility. For a great many people, there is at best an absence of failure. Wherever there is success there has to be failure. And then it is vitally important for the individual, and equally for the individual's family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a diference, and be **somebody**. "* (Drucker, 2008, pp. 53-54)

@outline - complication 
--> 



The complication, especially when the matter is an entrepreneurial effort such as when we dig in the startup journey, is that we do set ourselves as somebody - for the task - but we may not nurture the being that maintains the somebody. This is not intentional, as in pre-planned.

* @todo - p1 (Done) - In Success or Impact - Dorothea Brande's insight for success; Quote from p.43 of Wake up and Live: "That is the mental picture we make of the trial and error method of learning. Roughly, it is right, but it omits to emphasize one element of the process which, although we may not dwell upon it intentionally, is never forgotten by the Unconscious: the element of pain. We believe, or speak and write as though we believed, that the one success remains as the total residue of the series of attempts, and that it cancels from our minds all the failures which went before it. We do not take into account the tremendous importance to our future conduct of those discarded trials which ended in failure. We succeed at last, it is true; but meanwhile we experience failure, sometimes ridicule, sometimes real pain, sometimes grave humiliation.

Dorothea Brande, in *Wake Up and Live* (2014), had considered how we as humans in our attempts to succeed, and by engaging with trial-and-error - inded living through life between failures and successes and inded with Peter Drucker as "wherever there is success there has to be failure," - will miss a key understanding that our efforts by failure matters a lot and beyond the idea of lessons learned, that for the self, in special, our unconscious will not forget the cost of failures, what she referred as "the element of pain." She had considered our mistaken views that success acquired, to some extent, erases the pains acquired:   

> *"We believe, or speak and write as though we believed, that the one success remains as the total residue of the series of attempts, and that it cancels from our minds all the failures which went before it. We do not take into account the tremendous importance to our future conduct of those discarded trials which ended in failure.

In other words, the management of the self by lacking self-awareness about the situation of a path of pursuing success under uncertain conditions (and founders are a special kind either because they are the roots and that their ways will propagate,) may understimate the cost of failure, which may be characterized as they run in a sort of "under the influence" (of execution) situation, especially in the beginning when they are passionate, or feeling energetic, or call it whatever you want. The lack of awareness about such real cost, or lack of accountability of their well-being, may take them to a number of scenarios which are unknown to them. It may take them to control successes, not allowing themselves to enter risky experiments and to to adapt. It can be result from our urgency to control the outcome. But it is observable and unintended consequences are observable. It may set us to distance from what we care, or who we are, or who we want to be. We may risk losing connection with ourselves in the sense of breaking our integrity; these are situations which can be observable in the extremme. But before that, the more we don't care to being conscious about this underlying well-being, the more we set ourselves into a game, like gamblers, and like gamblers living with the intermediary day by day becoming controllers and not nurturing our well-being. 





Now the situation in particularly complicated as the most important resource does not get acquaintaied with this need of preparing this well-being for truly learning from the challenges and also acquiring a perspective, and getting involved in supporting the development of underlying values, in the context of the succcessul being that preserves the being. Thus, while we have high hopes, yet we fail in terms of its fundamental structure. From the extremme situations we may get into becoming a being that does it excessive ways, or obsessive ways, which may be a forceful characterization of the personality, as in controlling the outcome inadvertedly taking the being to be out of the zone of the learner being and of one who needs to be prepared to adapt. 

Now we do know that we human beings can learn in the extremme situations after major failures, as in after the battle ends as in post-mortem, learning after a death of a certain reality, has a truth for us. One which says that you may have under it another underlying somebody in there, giving you hope. And the fact that we learn big lessons from that sort of failure - which can be see as a deatch - means that the actual somebody from within is a fundamental element and key to our journeys. And to know that fundamental truth, that it is a being before the being that holds the hopes, we can then consider the actual complications for the life of the founder in terms of managing the self and the self in this path for success; that to neglect that openning herself up, for not expecting big major learning lessons from big major losses, can be a good investment, and that it can be created, can be nurtured, and that it will make a difference. 





What Peter is giving us there is perspective. If we lock in, accept and trust, that what we do with the job can be either successful or can fail, then the question is: How can I propose a successful situation - in the sense of a healthier - for the one that carries that job? Or better, would it be possible to propose a characterization of our roles as one that is "another person" in a way that he or she is successful even when he or she fails in the job? 

It is unexcapable that the one that needs to prepare for winnning or losing needs to be, as Peter wrote, somebody. The somebody that is yet alive after a big fail is likely one that listens. He or she is likely one that reflects. He or she is likely one that learns. He or she is likely one that is happy with either winning and not winning. If we explore now what would be the us that can get a job and complete the job and still be happy, we will start exploring the space of supporting ourselves, of respecting ourselves, or planning for what has to be done that never ignores the plan for the healthy mind of the protagonist. In a way is not different from what you would to to you children if she or he is entering a championship but has a long life ahead. Solve that situation and you have success solved and likely more chances to be successful in the job as well. 

Through the following two sections we will consider characterizations for giving us a perspective and awareness and to make a point, and a call, to set us to be aware, and involved. Through the first, *Split the Love*, we will consider a horizontal expansion exercise, that we are getting acquainted with the idea of not being a target from our experiments, not to be blind by the successful or the failure, in parallel, and engaging with being aware as a meta-executor. NExt, we will consider a vertical expansion, where we use the day investments and develop a conscious view that through the execution we are giving ourselves a chance to understand underlying values and investments that set us as the true successful being for the challenges ahead. 













### Splits love


You're probably aware of a condition, or state, that is generally known as to be heartbroken; when something breaks your heart. It may be a state of desperation in the face of the major loss. And it certainly involves a condition associated with grief. And from that - although it may not feel that we're even hopeful at during the moment - it's generally the case that it follows acceptance, which may imply the reflection. To think about possible extremmes, from that situation of one that were heartbroken, some of us may never allow ourselves to love again; and some others may eventually fall into loving again, and being as hard as before, heartbroken again. Something tells me that the answer lies in the middle and which requires to love us as beings. 

Now in the realm of the founder this is relevant because it is observable that we can be too involved with our views both in the situation of the day and also in the situation through the stages of the start-up evolution. In other words, the self-awareness of the executor should embody its state of well-being that characteristically releases control - for when the things they so passionately involve are challenged - in the face of external environment that changes significantly. Steve Blank highlights when a founder state of a firm believer - which is likely a characteristic of great founders - provokes emotional reaction that reaffirms its beliefs: 

> *"[If] they tell you that your baby is ugly, smoke is going to start coming out of your ears because cognitive dissonance is going to set in. You are a believer and now they are telling you that you are wrong? Are these people stupid? Which is - the first reaction of a great founder is: They just don’t get it."*
> Steve Blank (MAP14, 2014, 26m39s)

The situation pointed by Steve is not easy for any entrepreneur since what moves entrepreneurship forward might well be connected with that is thought as the job, such as goals or an outcome ahead. This is exactly the part that deserves a reflective moment - the identification of your whole, the elements that make one to be somebody beyond what they are currently doing. It's quite challenging, especially for founders that are excited with whatever they envisioned, to pause and reflect, to pull the elements that can support them to be somebody that serves the now and as well the future. 








Now another characterized situation of challenge can be taken from the case of a founder that lasts, which is not so common, but thankfully is the case of Brian Chesky of Airbnb; and because of that we have takeaways given by the Blitzscaling lectures. In terms of the challenges for adaptability of the self, the founding team, was brought by when Reid Hoffman, when he interviewed Brian Chesky wondering how truthful is the thesis of "What got you here does not get you there. " We should keep in mind that Airbnb went through the various stages of growth from Blitzscaling - family, tribe, village, city and nation. In this context, Brian points a strange perception, as a kind of question he used to get from people about Airbn, that growing a company is mostly about its founding days and then things goes like "you have this idea, it takes off, and you just gotta find a way to manage it." 

> *"I think stage one is actually fairly straight forward. [..] I don't think it's that complicated and even if it is, it's well written about. But the thing after that, there's not a lot of books about and everyone gives you the wrong advice. You gotta figure it out and you're kinda on your own. And the risk is, if I ask a CEO how to manage and they work at a huge company, they're gonna tell me the wrong thing. It's like you talk about you're skating, but it's not ice it's water. The ice skates don't work yet. We invited a former CEO over, and he gave me this piece of advice I'll never forget. He said, "Every six months you keep your job "it's a promotion." I almost think, in hindsight, it's better to say every six months is a totally different job. So it's not like this metaphor of you're an athlete and you're a tennis player and you play small tournaments and you work your way up. You start playing tennis, then you're like a bowler, then you're like a football player and then you're playing hockey. The job changes so much, you're almost playing a different sport every job."*

Brian is essentially considering, by noting that "there's not a lot of books about and everyone gives you the wrong advice," a potentially situation of anawareness due to the characterization of the model of execution which turns out to think of people as expendable resources. In other words, if the major entity, somehow grows but the inner entities (people) aren't up to it, they are replaceble. This might be the case of the start-up that grows and it may be a recognized key trait of the capitalist engine - that management can replace ideas and resources - which sets the self-cleaning oven to work as we have celebrated in the Introduction. However, we shall remind ourselves that this is a book for founders and framed the situation from their point of view, assuming that they are not expendable, in alighment with what I had briefly introduced in the Introduction that I want us to be around for more than this reading. Therefore, to have Brian being around, and to have him to reflect about what it takes to being around is key; another reason for us to be thankful for the Blitzscaling crew. Anyway, the point is that for the situation of one who wants to be around, to know the means to be around is key; and right there Brian does it exercising talking about, being reflective about, noting it; the importance of nurturing yourself as a being to learn and adapt. This is part of our job.

To exercise our perception for adaptation and reframing success and failures, we may consider the exercit of splitting our loves. The job of the executor which may characterize its structure based on success and failures, with the matter being executed.  What this exercise may do for us to essentially to sets us involved as a being that has self-love a being beyond to be a sole lover and potential target. Which would also go along with the lover situation by following along wth the idea of self love in the first place.

-->

Let us move to a case of one, making an MVP, an experiment, and planning a sort of plan B for life if the startup experiment goes bad. Imagine that you don't have time, and that you only have six months. And you are in a major project already, somehow you believe that this is a go and no go, and you too involved. Thus, from now, considering the end of it, which may have an outcome, you might engage in being prepared for things not working. One way I came accross, it I tell you that it came for the sake of need, was to think that what were doing were a simple résumé. And then you do it, and now you have a problem which is that you have two things in the front of you, and actual thing being done and a résumé. A sort of executor critic will chime in - to tell you to focus, or to commit, if the résumé building characterizations could create distraction. But see, if it is risky anyway, too risky, the full devotion to do it should not be anyway a reason that will fix. In fact you may well need to keep yourself involved in having a perspective. The actual résumé in this case than will take you through a path that is to some extent sets you as a professional, as a being, a professional; while giving you a view for a reflection too. 

A major concern for any of this effort will rise as using time for that kind of engagment, which may be seen as unproductive; thus this is where we should go back to recognize that to respect time is important. We aren't entering this to actually do the experiments on the side, using time that it does not exist, as it an excuse. The whole point is to bring in, is to be intentional. We can't nurture ourselves as ones who to solve major problems of adaptation will eventually ask help from outside. In other words help should comme from inside. Moreover, the more we put this investiment within the accounting structure, we more we will set ourselves to be responsible with this activity. 

But a key value from there is not only the setting of a plan B for a job; but in fact it's an involvement in separating the professional that does from the outcome produced; actually to some extent turning the outcome to become an output and then coming back to valuing yourself as a executor of activities. This may sound an absurd, if we lock ourselves in the view that outcomes is all that matters, but we are not saying full ignorance to outcome but in face promoting the awareness of the successful being where activities counts, effort counts, accounting of effort counts; which also set us to organize, and to plan. This is essentially being out of being attacked by the results from the outcome.


From a perspective of the investinng structure, you are essentially doing an exercise as a manager developing an investor role. Consider the plan Z idea of Reid and Ben, from *The Start-up of You*, when they consider that the existance of the plan A or B lies in the face of your plan Z, which is generally your life boat or a place to regroup. Within the same chapter entitled *Plan to Adapt*, which drew from start-ups lessons applicable to our careers which they called "ABZ planning", essentially setting ourselves to be successful no matter what, of course a virtuous version of no matter what that has to do with not allowing a fusion with the doer of the outcome with the essential doer:  

> *"The way to feel comfortable with these entrepreneurial strategies is to have one plan in your life that's highly certain. That's plan Z: a reliable plan you'll shift to when you no longer have confidence in plan A and B, or when your plans get severely disrupted. The certainty of the plan Z backstop is what enables you to be aggressive—not tentative—about plans A and B. With a plan Z, you will at least know you can tolerate failure. Without it, you could be frozen in fear contemplating the worst-case scenarios."* (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2012, p. 77)

--> 

The point is that this exercises in horizontal ways, as in on one hand plan A and on other hand plan B, requires the being to stand up for doing it, the vertical being is the Z axis, and it is Z exactly because it nurtures the being that can go through that appears to be a zig zag of life. And this is essentially too about setting ourselves not to be entirely out of that situation brought by Dorothea Brande, the costs of pain that can't be removed; but it sets us to not only see failures in different ways but too to be able to set ourselves in a good position to reflect. The horizontal exercise is an exercise for standing up to the exercise. 


### Transcends somebody


To some extent the above exercise of splitting oneself is one of expansion, detachment from the self, decharacterization of the doer of the job from the successful manager of the self. Now we may too look at this expansion exercise from another angle, or axis, the vertical one, which is when we think of all that we do in a way connected with values and the investments that support our success indirectly. IN other words, that characterization of the one who builds a résumé while doing it can be consider as one that defines a more enlightened well-being. 

Let us consider an imaginary case of a founder that proposes an start-up that is quite agressive and wants to put a dent in the universe. It might use AI and other elements that are considered hot too. This founder has defined a cetain potential customer target, a set of people with a need, that their professional lives will be better. So we know the premisses, of the importance to define a job to do which offers value as the experiment for potential opportunities but also is at the same time an effort, a professional effort. And it is because I need to trust that the bad outcome is a possibility. An example, say that I have a customer, and that she is a psychologist and the so-far-product helps her. But the product might out of the sudden disappear, I know. What should I do? What is the current plan that can split success when the actual "product" is vanished? This complication may be the case too when founders are creating sales experiments in the digital world - they may set themselves, characterize themselves, and into that being hyper precise; it looks like it's all real. They can create pitches and sales materials and then when you see there is nothing there. This may set them in a place of confusion, as if when they think that they are lying with their customers or with themselves; which may even take some of them to consider implementing something real. But still, a pitch or a sales material or a prototype is not really real in terms of the future. Thus one way to understand the situation in more successful ways is to consider what that means to the self, to the start-up, and to the customer, and to the world. 

Consider the possibility of a contract that you can write with yourself. Where I said, or wrote, that I am doing an effort of work to help myself, to help the start-up, to help the product. There is no right order here as all that we are doing is a discovery of values, value for the self, value for the product, value for the customer, and value for the world. With that, in case of failure of the experiment, or the product, or the start-up, the response plan may yet carry on values that can be meaningful from looking in perspective. The concract can then turn out to be a contribution to all the parties involved. This does not have to be complex because the point is to engage with the exercise of understanding value and to do in in ways that is honest with the parties involved. In the case of my start-up experiment, since it had to do with improving the life of psychologists, I also understood that it had to do with improving the life of a real person who happened to be my customer. When all failed, I yet kept important to her exactly because of that level of honesty involved which would involve too explaning to her the risk of the situatiojn or helping her to have an equivalent or better solution in place. In other words, essentially you create a professional contract where you do not let down the parties involved; and with that at the same time create learning opportunities and networking opportunities from all that you do. This is too a preservation of respect. Notice that a principle of well-being for the long run is present here and it is organizing the present situation of the start-up, for the customer, and as well for myself as a founder, and for humanity. 

One other component based on the same principle, that what I do is published, kept alive, so that the work I do can be seen. Therefore, and since controlling success is not possible, I can at least focus on progress. I can update my résumé constantly while doing the job. I can improve myself in being on time. I can improve my writing. I can study subjects. I learn how to listen. I can course-correct the plan after failing. These are traits of success that can be secured, for the person, aside from the actual effort of execution. A lot of professionals are quite professionals even when they are working for companies that had funding but out of the sudden the funding dries out. These folks can still have jobs after. And these folks should have a life always. 

One situation in particular may be interesting to observe and within the actual start-up context has originally puzzled me when I was studying the Blitzscaling lectures. It's a known moment from the history of Airbnb before Airbnb, then they were Air Bed and Breakfast. You can also remember of this moment as the story of the Cereal Entrepreneur; a joke according to Brian Chesky but it became for me very serious when I got the underlying lesson from it, that through their effort they were both founders and professional beings: 

> *"So we started making breakfast cereal. And we made presidential-themed breakfast cereal. We made a Barack Obama themed cereal. We called it Obama Oh's, The Breakfast of Change. And we created John McCain themed cereal. We called it Capt'n McCain's, A Maverick in Every Bite. And we literally hand crafted our own cereal boxes. And we basically used a gin up press and also, frankly desperation. And I hadn't been eating at this point, so I was probably also starting to get slightly delirious. But, we called General Mills, they were like, "What are you talking about? You seriously think we're gonna make unlicensed presidential-themed cereal?" We're like, "Okay, I guess you won't." And so then, we called these medium-sized cereal companies. They're like, "Great, just send us a non-refundable check for $200,000." I'm like, "OK, that's not gonna work." So we found this guy in Berkley. He was an alumni of RISD. He says, "I can't print you 100,000 boxes of cereal, but here's what I'll do. I'll print you 1,000 boxes of cereal for free, just give me a royalty." We're like, "Thank you!" One day, Joe comes back with 1,000 pieces of giant cardboard. I'm like, "What the hell is that?" He's like, "These are the cereal boxes." They were just pieces of cardboard we had to fold and glue into boxes. No one told me that. So, to fund the company we basically folded, like giant origami, 1,000 boxes of collectible breakfast cereal, had to pack cereal in them, and we sold them for $40 a box. We thought who was going to pay $40 a box, but they were limited edition, so we hand numbered every one. We called it limited edition. And we ended up selling $30,000 of cereal. And that's actually how we funded the company."* (Chesky Brian., 2015, 17:18)

It may not be the case that they were intentional, that what they did had to do with establishing a sort of plan B, what I call plan P - being professional - because it came in a way that looks like real life, because they needed money. Nevertheless, observations for their characterization as professionals with ties with the characterizations of founders which were recognized as valuable. One in particular was how Paul Graham, of YCombinator have seen their movement - which likely would be first considered as a distraction to the core business: 

> *"And so we meet with Paul Graham at Y Combinator. And he thought the idea was absolutely terrible. In fact, he said, 'People are actually doing this?' And I said, 'Yeah.' And the second question was, 'What's wrong with them?' And I said, 'Oh shit!' So I thought this was a really bad interview, but by the end of the interview, Joe hands him a box of Obama Oh's. And Paul Graham thought that we just bought this stupid box of cereal. And he's like, 'No, this is how we funded the company.' And Paul Graham said, 'If you can convince people to pay $40 for a $4 box of cereal, maybe you can get strangers to stay in other strangers' homes.' And he also liked us 'cause he said we were cockroaches. And he said, 'It's an investment nuclear winter and the only people that will survive are cockroaches and you're a cockroach.'"* (Chesky Brian., 2015, 19:54)

For Paul Graham certainly he took other characterizations  - they ability to do it, their qualities as designers, their ability to engage with the effort. If things didn't work, they had done something. So then, right then, I would say that what they did were a plan XYZ. This may connect a thought from Reid and Ben Casnocha from *The Start-up of You* when he considered that you need to get into new opportunities but never in a way that you don't have a known condition. So if Paul Graham saw value in them these seemed to be not values shown by standard start-up characterizations while, at the same time, not values seen by arbitrary people. To remind ourselves, we are talking about Paul Graham the advisor-investor-author that had proposed that *Startups = Growth*, exactly being aware right there, not only of the the general importance of doing things that don't scale (before scaling) but being interested in values. 





This exercises, the horizontal exercise, detachment, and the vertical, considering integrity, can be reconsidered under an enlighted view from Abraham Maslow in Maslow on Managenent. In Memorandum on Salesman and Salesmanship (1998, p. 259), Maslow ilustrates a salesperson type that is concerned with the present, a practical type, that is less aware of the consequences of what they do in time and space: 

> *"The salesman type, is also more concrete (rather than abstract). He tends to be preoccupied with what is before his nose, with what he can see and touch and feel and what is right here and right now, rather than that which is unseen and which is distant and delayed."* (Maslow, 1998, p. 259)

On the other hand, when Maslow considers the ideal type, a theoretical or enlighted salesperson, it goes all the way to indicate a humanized being that cares to the customer such as to the point of not prioritizing his selling in the face of listening to the customer needs. But the enlighted view recognizes our tendency to contrast "in a dichotonomous way the practical person with the theoretical person, in the sense that we expect the theoretical person to not be practical." (1998, p.259). His point, when stressing that aspect, goes on to add that "one lesson that we have learned from the study of healthy people is that the healthy person is apt to be everything. In this instance the healthy theoretcical person would be both healthy and practical, depending upon the particular situation and the objective needs of that situation." (1998, p.259)

The point being, after Maslow's enlightened viewpoint and besides the fact that in the pursuing of success we are likely in a hurry, is about the importance that being practical, such as focusing on present needs, should coexist with a healthy consciousness management of the self, one that supports the release from fixations, from obsessions, such as obsessions from the present needs of the entrepreneur (not unlike the present sales needs as illustrated,) one that maintains the potential of being somebody. This precondition demands, before anything, a good deal of courage, one that shall take us to manage, to shift, our objectives, to change the rationale for decision making and the use of our time.
