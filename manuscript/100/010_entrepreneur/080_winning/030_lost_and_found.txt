### Accounting networking 

* lead - my friend fabricio once said that he was standing in the shoulders if Giants - in one of his blog posts I guess. Years later I was watching the following talk interview with Marc Andreessen and he said that he carries on a mini Peter Thiel in his shoulder:

What are these guys saying really? Maybe Marc's explanation is a good one: mental models. Yes, they can be biased but yet the mental model carries in a strategy, it's intended to be the other and not to simply be yourself.

The author Jim Collins explored also a related idea in his concept of the personal board.

And Brian Chesky, cofounder or Airbnb, contrasted pretty well the case of the one that lives in a successful rich network vs the one that does not have direct access to a rich network - his advice is to get them as books because books are cheap.

#### actionable mental networking

* Reid Hoffman, the cofounder of linkedin, offers a networking view that is actionable. One can navigate networks such as using data and subjects and problems that important people have at their plates. Check startup of you p 197.

#### jumping from resonating information to contact

* Example of action in the network opting in towards contact, as presented by Reid and Ben: (< book: the startup of you ) Knowledge-and-networked actionable - resourcefulness - Reid shows an amazing example by Sheryl Sandberg on how she have approached a research task that was given to her by her boss Larry Summers at the World Bank - p 197 Reid Hoffman and then Casnocha in The Startup of You: she engaged in asking help about the subject of the research, to a historian. This is example of navigating information throught people.

* Of course the example of Sheryl is of one that has contacts and was able to reach out. But a lot of people have the contacts and they tend to the reading, to the research only. So even for people with good and rich networks it demands a great deal of initiative to navigate via networking.

* Yet, back to the virtual approach - is also very normal as shown in the case of Marc. He does not call all the time Peter Thiel.

Bridging from the virtual to the real - in my fast clip networking idea I am exercising the possibility that the virtual electronic mental developments can eventually access the real people. One thing Is to use the network Intelligence to map out the knowledge development in time. The other is to map out people'identity to have them to update what they do and also to show what problems they seek to solve? I once experimented with crossing the barrier from archieved information to the real because I sensed the open challenge of the networker in progress: Reid Hoffman was a host in the series of lecturers for Stanford freshman students entitled Blitzscaling. In his talk with Michael Dearing I was subtitling and then I did t understood what he said. Turned to linked in, and wrote to him without having access direct to him like I so for many other people. Interesting it was that Reid replied and told me that he was busy but if I wanted he was able to put his co-author to help me to disambiguate. At that moment I learned that the subject in transit was important to him. Thus, there is the moment between the static knowledge and the dynamic knowledge that is being formed for networks.

Going back to your virtual personal board, and trying to tie actions, is the way to go. Thus the real question for your board is yourself curating, revisiting, your board via actions that you think are going to help you out with your goals.
