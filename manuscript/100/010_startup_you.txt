# Time is relative, okay?

* ( ) Differentiate - 970_winnning.txt - The winning touches the aspect of growth but in fact it deals with the release of control in the face of the uncertain. This one deals with the identification of the investiment of the unit of energy, accounting time, respecting time. 

* SCqA - Subject - Entrepreneurship is growth, but growth and innovate, requires learning, after failure, as it is experiential - thus we shall respect to basic energy unit of time. 

* SCqA - Situation - Risk seems low, or energy being "soft" mislead to caothic, in the face of no guidance.  But initial currency of power, appears driven by non-measurable units, such as love, values. Entering into scaling models, tools or methods to scale, also leads to higher bets, later to learn in retrospect. 

* SCqA - Complication - Model of betting with the no pre accounting of time, and the nature, experiential learning, as it can't be known how to do it; is denied. As in growth for mission, focus on mission, not focus on how to do and team, or internal being growth, denial of accounting time and transparently statement of time, which would take to accounting much more failures as in - I don't know where I am going. 

* SCqA - Key 1 - How Experience - Initial units, love and values, and time of individuals, seem high speed. Although potential of frustration increases. And the competing is the "higher enemy of a startup" as Brian Indicates, time. See, "if the idea if any good everybody will dismiss" implies in surfing in things unknown. So, in the unknown, and when nothing happens, it costs what? Will power, the energy for using time units. 

* SCqA - Key 2 - How Experience Investing Risk - The nature of growth pulls for "higher investing" the model asks scale, such as to do more elaborate bets. The denial of pre-accounting the use of time, spreads, to self, to team, and to the audience of risk investing. We lack currency. 

* SCqA - Key 3 - Considerations for respect of time - For self, pre-saying, stating, no mattr what. Repsect for time is transparency and it should enable the involvement with experiential learning nature. And leads to accounting methods for measuring that it takes vs. bets, leads to better visualization of risk investing nature.

Entrepreneurship and innovation involves risk and investing, thus the need to manage the time, or usage in time, of resources. At the earlier stages it's even more critical. Common sense indicates startup ability to pivot fast, as a plus. Yes, the ship is small, you can turn around quick. But the general idea of pivoting fast, and dynamics of the small team, seem to hide the a chaotic reality that can mislead teams to navigate thinking that they are doing productively. The major problem starts with lack of awareness about learning, or the cost of learning, and the underlying dimension that justifies learning, time. We will reflect about respecting time. At times, this very invitation would sound as an absurd.  

## Focus on the mission growth

All entrepreneurial action seeks growth. Some entrepreneurs start with what seems to be vision. They dream of a new category of thing that can put a dent in the universe, like going to the moon or reinventing the way rockets can land. [^footnote_category_design]. Other entrepreneurs start with other needs such as to make money, to have success, as in the money maker or perhaps a money appropriator [^footnote_ayn_rand_money_maker]. Others simply are pushed into a work, and they need to do that because, in a way or another, of money, such as to pay the rent. What seems to be common among situations is that the entrepreneurial journey is growth, which is evidently recognized for the situation of startups [^footnote_growth_paul_graham], but to get out from an initial state into another, better state, where they give value and expect benefits in return, such as benefits that sustain more growth. 

[^footnote_growth_paul_graham]: 

The situation involves failing and learning, as part of the journey to grow. This failure is a known outcome of any growth aspect. Growth simply does not happen without failure, although the necessary learning aspect comes after. Some of the practitioners, or mentors or parters, do recognize failure, and the necessary aspect of resillience in the face of failure - needed traits to this journey. Fail, fail, fail, and learn, fail fast, learn fast, that sort of idea. This is also part of the entrepreneurial setting situation. [^footnote_bill_drapper_fail_fail]. 

[^footnote_bill_drapper_fail_fail]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDxRUYEMXg 

When they are in it for a startup, in the face of uncertainty which is like the case when a team needs to innovate, the reality is that the pressure for learning with experience is part of the process. Thus learning happens, and the phenomenon involves the nature of assembling a ship as they sail [^footnote_reid_assemble_airplane]. With that, learning in retrospect is likely what happens, which is not bad, but that shows the inclination, or willingness, to not consider the learning component, or planning for learning, or anything that accounts what it takes to get since you don't have references for that, again, no guides. 

[^footnote_reid_assemble_airplane]: 

A related idea was presented by Fabr√≠cio Morini, a situation of entrepreneurs that adopt a reactive style, moving in response to environmental situation, like the present. He called it "fazejamento", an English equivalent would be the "Do-ification" that is common wit all sorts of enterprises and may actually work for some situations. Plus, learning after is certainly better than nothing. But in the context of startups and any entrepreneurial effort oriented to growth, the doing and learning after mistakes is not enough.

In the article about success, 970_winning.txt, Reid interviews Brian Chesky about the challenges to face unseen challenges as the game changes, with the line "What got you here does not get you there".

## The currency 

But why the nature supports that sort of appraoch of doing? We have a few components. The situation allows room for say cheaply mixing ideas and coming up with innovative models that can indeed scale. People accept that out of their thirstness to innovate they can do things, and that their movements is hyper fast. 

It starts with chaos, fail, fail, learning, fail fast, pivot fast, ability to course correct, inertia, the nature of startups, small teams, or an individual considering the project phase / Risk and bets are higher at the beginning, relatively - how we experience, warp, user innovation, paying rent, effort, motivation, romantic notions, or bets engaged like what? - Others were driven with that seem to be what Eric von Hippel referred as User Innovation. They all started with a problem they wanted to solve. That function seems to be quite alive, as anyone might "live through the challenges first-hand" that gives them a viewpoint for what can be different, motivation to seek answers, perhaps even their connection with the story is a supporting factor that makes them run through the stages when stages change. Perhaps they find the right cofounders too on their ways, exactly because of their identity with their goals, the general story that likely supports them. In other words, a good mission and one that is really into that, shows to be effective. 

What really seems challenging is that in the face of this general growth need, many pick a given path. It's not a complication, it's a door. But once the door is openned, it is trick to get out from it. It is not that the person has the "entrepreneurial room" where they can enter that dorm sometimes, live through the challenges of doing it, and then go to the living room, to live a little. No, it's more like a time-capsure or a space ship that puts us to only see the reality of the ship. We go out, fix the ship, try to assemble the ship. 

The journey of entrepreneurship generally, at least it seems to be up to nowadays, happen to be a journey with certain destination and certain setting that really seems to define the hard reality. Once you are launched, whatever is your start, you are likely to be compelled to move at high speed, within that time-scale, and using boosters, things we sort of pick which you think can take you there. 

Then, the real complication comes. Again, you can't go back to base. You can't say "Houston, we have a problem!". And it is not that you don't have a radio. You have it but it is connected and no one cares really for what is happening with you. It's a lot of voices. It is a space where it is really difficult to see the origin of problems. As an example, a startup path being taken seems to be a precise best path of an idea that comes the way of a founder. But that startup path is one of the paths, and seems based in good intentions towards growth but the idea and the motivations of the founder, when of other origin, can pull them to later figure that they were in a startup sort of ship, moving at high-speed, or what seems to be high-speed, but they find themselves locked in sort of dead end later. Eventually caught themselves, after time passes, after learning in retrospect. TIme will always solve the equation, time is the universal underlying thing.  Them, the real complication, is that founders deny time beyond anything. This article is about honoring time. 

### The denial of the currency 

In stage 0, currency that moves seems to be love, values, vision, motivation. Trips seem to be fast. But any attempt into growth, of earlier higher investments, leads to bets of higher. In relative terms, the sense of productivity is too big, for the scale of what happens.  

Our tendency in growth for the mission ignores growth for the self, team, and the situation of stage. The complication is our inability contextualize the context, as in the learning does not fit the context, learning cannot zoom in and zoom out. 

The productive engine, which is natural, need, needs to depend on a reflective engine. There is no way to ignore that. Thus, it does not matter if one is in it to make money or executing or coming from vision, the need to organize how to navigate the space in the face of unknown conditions, must be accounted. It has to be done from inside out. It's quite rare that one can fix with superpowers that comes on our way. And when superpowers come our way to help, to guide, it is likely that comes for the people that are aware about the learning cost and importance. The general rule is learning that comes after failure. But the learning after failure implies in recognizing a cycle of investment is key and involves the risk factor that needs to be of the experiential learning nature. 

A major complication, of challenge of an entrepreneur, is the dichotonomous situation between the founder and the investor, such as a venture capitalist investor. It appears to be irrelevant for a founder to look the world of risk-based investment, and to understand the nature of entrepreneurship and the scaling nature, and release of control for what seems to be what is going on. 

Entrepreneurs do understand, or sense or feel, that they are seeking to innovate towards worlds that they do not know how what the rules are. The all sorts of odds shall come our way, things of a nature they don't know. And in the face of those things, the need for speed seems to be must. The situation provokes us to consider the role of management, at best. 


 deny the that the cycle of learning in the setting of entrepreneurship is a cycle of experiential learning, that happens again and again. 

Consider frustration potential accumululation, then time of life competes. Unfortunatelly, there is not a lot of data for the many that had great vision, really first-hand experience, and even time and energy, but failed to find the right pieces such as good cofounders, or that heard an impressive investor, and where warped into fading, diying slowly [^footnote_brian_pg_startsfade].

## Leaning for higher bets 

Scaling models affects time reality -- capsules of models -  unconscious about unit of resources and investing bet, analysis of models of support, parallel realities.  -  Models do what? Framwork? Incubation? Tools, frameworks, traction with customers?  With some of these pathways being promising, but the entrepreneurs capsule having rudimentar setting and limited fuel. The willingness to find a solution in a new world, a given path of effort, pulls. Part of them want to visit planet X because of love, part of them seem to know that time is moving, that fuel is being used. The complication is that, new data comes their way, such as insights from the team about management of resources, they fail to manage the fuel of the critical energy unit, the human being and each individual. The answer to the problem lies in respecttime and to know that time is relative. Could, perhaps, connect with how entrepreneurial journeys start. Perhaps the idea of "I will make a startup" fits in a wider bucket, in the end of the day. Let's be honest, and for that we need to look at some of the patters of growth, in terms of organizations. Some startups start with the ideal to scale fast but then notice that the area/domain chosen might need some other strategy for that. In Blitzscaling, Reid and Chris bring about the fact, or the test, that are things that could indeed have a scaling nature. But then, what happens with the entrepreneur, the team, founders call it whatever you want that are into something and then out of the sudden comes to notive a big - oh, wait, I thought I was doing X with a Y model but reality is different. I thought I knew how relativity works. And the metaphor here, slightly implied, of an entrepreneur that dives in a space journey within a capsure warping hyperfast, sort of believing that she is strong and that the thin layer won't break, is in fact, when new worlds are ahead, going to come across such big waves and the real experience of being there, where time seems to move slow, but when they come back from these journeys, hopefully alive to experience and tell what has happened, they are then, to start that experience by first notice that time has moved too fast for whowever where down to earth. And then, sayings such as "I thought I was making a startup, that would have time to visit that planet and come back with a solution to people from Earth" but this mission, lazarous , somehoew brought me here, older and I hope wisier, to tell that reality is different. And I don't even know if I went there in the first palce to save the people from earth. Maybe I am just wanted to learn what is out there. We should keep annotated, that some of these astronauts do find interesting new worlds and ways to change reality of earth, and ways to impact people from earth. When that journey involves the right team, the right planet, and a lot of learning that helps them to assemble what they need, on the go, or when they get support from the beings of a higher dimension, yes, it seems to be amazing journey. Is what I hear from people that reported on the actual life journeys. 

## Infinite apprentice 

We need to respect ourselves, starting with time. In other words, the question is: At the minimal level, with no no map to assemble the rest of the ship as it travels fast, with no guide to pick the right guide, and no special star appears to be more promissing, what to do? 

For an enlighed view on what it takes to grow, we can make evident that awareness about the learning of how we do it is key, can be expressed by the question "How did I do?" Reid Hoffman says that Brian cheeky asked that question in the light of his first press event for Airbnb. For Reid, Brian is an infinite learner [^footnote_reid_hoffman_brian_infinite_learner].  Thus, perhaps, the actual complication is that we see no reasons for being an always learner, or we shall not even grasp what is the nature of that. And if we face, it, why? Isn't it an infinite learner one that wastes time? It would be, if one actually in fact reads Reid's comment too fast. A too-fast consideration for this notion can take us to find an instant objection - a yellow light that blinks and tell us that we would run the risk of being obsessed with learning, or losing focus. 

[^footnote_reid_hoffman_brian_infinite_learner]: 

The nature for explaining the infinite learner lives in the very same interview video when Brian recognizes the know-it-all model and the risks of bring one: 

> *"" Brian Chesky 

In other worlds, an infinite learner that is never a know-it-all, might suggest an infinite apprendice notion and for that, as illustrated in the situation that was light for Reid, Brian displayed a self-awareness of being an apprentice on the go, which is very different from being an apprentince after the fact. In other words, being humble and to be aware that what might be happening at all stages, need a state of awareness about its learning, which bring us to the the notion of the experiential learning and connecting the dots that learning in the environment of entrepreneurship involves the recognition of learning with the experience, experiential learning. 

Not able to account, and respect, this basic unit of investment is bad. It is the learning effort, or the cycle of learning and creating abstrations after experimentation, experiential learning. 

Respect kolb, Respect the individual, and establish learning about self. Consider let it go and the post-mortem freedom of that. Respect time of team - and respect management. Consider team let it go and the post-mortem freedom of that. Respect time of investing and respect risk. Consider let it go and the post-mortem freedom of that.  Respect the investing nature for anything that has risk involved and the balancing of execution, or commitment activities, with aspirational or important strategic activities that closes the gap with the future, brings a different future potential, but may need effort for time-space. 

It is challenging that we do not have all the time in the world, we know. As we dive into multiple activities, and pressure for growth happens, we also scale our own inner ability to ignore time, as in trying to make time, or print currency withouth keeping the acocunting of the gold. Our approach for "making time" is our solution within pressure and involves the denial of the fundamental energy of a team, it's time, which will likely spread in the culture and enable the doing and learning after fail, a certain possible mode of operation, but quite toxic, or enablingn of a toxic by-product.  

This starts with the recognition that the fundamental unit of any venture, whether a startup or a large corporation, is people. Each individual, whether a founder, team member, or collaborator, contributes their unique energy to the organization. And this energy needs to be respected and managed effectively. We can't simply carve out more time for important tasks, as if using time that is already consumed by the urgent but leaves a new agenda‚Äîmaking more time for this other exploration. We need to ensure that the time dedicated to tasks is well-spent. This implies allowing each person to do their part, respecting their time and energy. We can't confuse well-spent with doing more, outside of planned time for energy. 

From this idea, we need to consider the necessary investment in the process where execution depends on learning. In other words, it's necessary to account for the cyclical nature of the process and the time in stages such as experimentation, reflection, conceptualization, and application [^footnote_kolbmodel]. In other words, recognizing the time to make mistakes and learn while we execute. The balance between these factors is crucial for efficient management.

[^footnote_kolbmodel]: Kolb's model is a theory of experiential learning, which postulates that learning is a process involving four stages: concrete experimentation, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. This learning cycle was proposed by David A. Kolb, who argued that these four stages are critical for the effective understanding and application of new concepts and skills. The space between reaction and planning is where true entrepreneurship thrives. In this space, we learn to adapt to market realities and find time to plan and reflect.

The good news is also sad news. Generally, it demands a preparation of courage, more than dedication, to explore the balance. Explore because we don't exactly know what this space of balance is. By respecting our own time‚Äîas well as the time of those who work with us‚Äîand recognizing that each of us contributes unique energy, and by dedicating time to team learning, we can, first of all, succeed in the matter of internal growth of the entrepreneur(s), the team, which is critical for any success in the team environment, in the culture, that makes the result of entrepreneurship and more chances for the culture of growth. In other words, inner growth is crucial for any growth in the world of entrepreneurship. This is evolving in the process and the process itself.
