# Time is relative, okay? 

Entrepreneurship and innovation involves risk and investing, thus the need to manage the time, or usage in time, of resources. At the earlier stages it's even more critical. Common sense indicates startup ability to pivot fast, as a plus. Yes, the ship is small, you can turn around quick. But the general idea of pivoting fast, and dynamics of the small team, seem to hide the a chaotic reality that can mislead teams to navigate thinking that they are doing productively. The major failure starts with the lack of awareness about the use of time. We will dive into reflecting for the basic unit of work, time. We will reflect about respecting time. At times, this very invitation would sound as an absurd.  

All entrepreneurial action seeks growth. Some entrepreneurs start with what seems to be vision. They dream of a new category of thing that can put a dent in the universe, like going to the moon or reinventing the way rockets can land. [^footnote_category_design]. Other entrepreneurs start with other needs such as to make money, to have success, as in the money maker or perhaps a money appropriator [^footnote_ayn_rand_money_maker]. Others simply are pushed into a work, and they need to do that because, in a way or another, of money, such as to pay the rent. What seems to be common among situations is that the entrepreneurial journey is about growth [^footnote_growth_paul_graham], to get out from an initial state into another, better state, where they give value and expect benefits in return, such as benefits that sustain more growth. 

[^footnote_growth_paul_graham]: 

The situation is that failing and learning is part but in the journey to grow is failure, which is a known outcome of any growth aspect. Growth simply does not happen without failure, although the necessary learning aspect comes after. Some of the practitioners, or mentors or parters, do recognize failure, and the necessary aspect of resillience in the face of failure - needed traits to this journey. Fail, fail, fail, and learn, fail fast, learn fast, that sort of idea. This is also part of the entrepreneurial setting situation. [^footnote_bill_drapper_fail_fail]. 

[^footnote_bill_drapper_fail_fail]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDxRUYEMXg 

When they are in it for a startup, and as learning happens, as they try to assemble their ship as they sail [^footnote_reid_assemble_airplane], and they find major roadblocks and figure that the model seems wrong; learning in retrospect seems to be always the case, which is not bad, but this shows signs of inclination to not pre account learning. Not able to account, and respect, basic unit of learning and cycle of learning and creating abstrations after experimentation, experiential learning. 

[^footnote_reid_assemble_airplane]: 

For an enlighed view on what it takes to grow, we can make evident our willingness to have no time to ask - how did I do? Reid Hoffman says that Brian cheeky asked that right in the first press event he did about Airbnb. For Reid, Brian is an infinite learner. [^footnote_reid_hoffman_brian_infinite_learner]. Our problem is lack of awareness about risk nature, innovation and entrepreneurship nature, nature of fast movements and big investing unit, scale of focus, cost of learning, nature of the matter from risk, and models that impacts, more complicated, main, learning cycle accounting. 

[^footnote_reid_hoffman_brian_infinite_learner]: 

Thus, perhaps the actual complication, is that we see no reasons for being an anways learner. And if we face, it, why? Isn't it an infinite learner one that wastes time? It would be, if one actually in fact reads Reid's comment too fast. In the face of our need to grow, we lack grow for ourselves, the being executing all. The first mistake we make is that we are in it, in a risk-based investment, seeking to innovate towards worlds we do not know how what the rules are. The all sorts of odds shall come our way, things of a nature we don't know. And in the face of those things, the need for speed seems to be must, but mainly provoking us to start deying the that the cycle of learning in the setting of entrepreneurship is a cycle of experiential learning, and that we need, for that, to respect ourselves, starting with time. 

So the question is, at the minimal level, with guides, no map to assemble build the rest of the ship, no likeness to pick the right guide, no light to guide for what is the right path or boosting solution, such as what models to hear, what to do? Respect time. 

The productive engine, which is natural, need, needs to depend on a reflective engine. There is no way to ignore that. Thus, it does not matter if one is in it to make money or executing or coming from vision, the need to organize how to get things done is a pattern. It has to be done from inside out. It's quite rare that you can fix with superpowers that comes on your way unless you are sort of blessed with protection? That allows trying again and again. The general rule is learning that comes after failure. But the learning after failure implies in recognizing a cycle of investment and the learning cycle - two notions we can reflect on. 

## Failing and learning and lack of courage? 

* scqa - Key 1 - How do we experience? - * situation - chaos, fail fail, learning, fail fast, pivot fast, ability to course correct, less inertia, the nature of startups, small teams, or an individual considering the project phase / Risk and bets are higher at the beginning, relatively - how we experience, warp, user innovation, paying rent, effort, motivation, romantic notions, or bets engaged like what? - Others were driven with that seem to be what Eric von Hippel referred as User Innovation. They all started with a problem they wanted to solve. That function seems to be quite alive, as anyone might "live through the challenges first-hand" that gives them a viewpoint for what can be different, motivation to seek answers, perhaps even their connection with the story is a supporting factor that makes them run through the stages when stages change. Perhaps they find the right cofounders too on their ways, exactly because of their identity with their goals, the general story that likely supports them. In other words, a good mission and one that is really into that, shows to be effective. Unfortunatelly, there is not a lot of data for the many that had great vision, really first-hand experience, and even time and energy, but failed to find the right pieces such as good cofounders, or that heard an impressive investor, and where warped into fading, diying slowly [^footnote_brian_pg_startsfade].

What really seems challenging is that in the face of this general growth need, many pick a given path. It's not a complication, it's a door. But once the door is openned, it is trick to get out from it. It is not that the person has the "entrepreneurial room" where they can enter that dorm sometimes, live through the challenges of doing it, and then go to the living room, to live a little. No, it's more like a time-capsure or a space ship. The journey of entrepreneurship generally, at least it seems to be up to nowadays, happen to be a journey with certain destination and certain setting that really seems to define the hard reality. Once you are launched, whatever is your start, you are likely to be compelled to move at high speed. 

Then, the real complication comes. Again, you can't go back to base. You can't say "Houston, we have a problem", and worse, it is really difficult to see the origin of problems. As an example, a startup path can't be a precise best path for any idea that comes the way of a founder. The startup path is one of the paths, and pulls towards growth but the idea and the motivations of the founder, when of other origin, can pull them to later figure that they were in a startup sort of ship, moving at hyper speed, or what seems to be hyper speed, but they find themselves locked in a sort of prison. Eventually they are caught, after time passes, to figure learning. TIme will always solve the equation, time is the universal underlying thing.  Them, the real complication, is that founders deny time beyond anything. This article is about honoring time. 

## How we experience - the doing 

Em um extremo do espectro empreendedor, temos aqueles que empreendem por necessidade. Impulsionados pela pressão do ambiente externo, eles reagem e executam. Seguindo o conceito de [^fabriciomorinifazejamento] de Fabrício Morini, esses empreendedores adotam um estilo reativo, movendo-se em resposta às pressões ambientais e sociais. Este método pode funcionar para muitos. O acaso de identificar maneiras de fazer melhor, a vontade de operacionalizar e responder aos clientes pode levar ao sucesso no tempo.

[^fabriciomorinifazejamento]: Fazejamento é uma ideia que eu encontrei no livro de Fabricio Morini intitulado Faça seu Negócio Decolar. Inclusive eu troquei uma mensagem com o Fabrício via e-mail, uma forma de agradecer porque achei que ele contextualizou bem o que fazemos, o jeito que vamos fazendo e aprendendo. 

No entanto, quando este modo de operação não funciona, a falta de planejamento pode ser desastrosa. Pode resultar em esgotamento do capital de giro, uma vez que a empresa não pode se dar ao luxo de errar por mais tempo.

### How we experience - the execution for vision - also doing it 

No outro extremo, temos os empreendedores que planejam e olham para frente. Esses empreendedores concentram-se na visão e tentam transpor para a realidade. Eles elaboram planos de negócios meticulosos mas quando se colocam no mercado as coisas começam a dar errado.  Essa ideia é bem articulada na colocação de Steve Blank que disse que nenhum plano de negócios sobrevive o primeiro contato com o cliente[^stevebusinessplan].  

[^stevebusinessplan]: O artigo do Steve Blank em inglês https://steveblank.com/2010/11/01/no-business-plan-survives-first-contact-with-a-customer-%E2%80%93-the-5-2-billion-dollar-mistake/

### A necessidade de adaptação e planejamento

Muitos empreendedores se veem frustrados e até decepcionados com a arte de empreender quando suas ideias não são aceitas pelo mercado, ou qualquer que seja a forma rudimentar que eles encontram de medir interesse do mercado. No lado do que está sempre fazendo, uma frustração sobre a situação atual nunca dará margem para ousar e testar uma oportunidade grande, a chance de crescer. O que podemos tirar tisso é uma ideia sobre a situação ser as duas faces da mesma moeda. É o mesmo problema estampado, uma prisão que nos colocamos e uma oportunidade de refletirmos sobre o tempo e a relatividade. 

Nestes dois extremos apontados, surgem desafios que exigem adaptação e planejamento. Para o empreendedor reativo, há a necessidade de abrir espaço a partir da execução, olhar para frente e planejar. Para o empreendedor visionário, há a necessidade de adaptar o plano de negócios à realidade, buscar resultados que geram recursos para ações de maior risco. 

No entanto, vale lembrar, que se houvesse tempo, paciência, aprendizado e recursos ilimitados, não existiriam coisas que não funcionam. Mas como tempo não é infinito, temos que em meio a todas essas experiências, o que temos, no dia a dia, tem mais a ver com mais ou menos energia consumida, mais ou menos investimento, mais ou menos planejamento, mais ou menos falhas, mais ou menos sucesso. 

## Accelerated investing models and risk perception 

Others were driven with that seem to be what Eric von Hippel referred as User Innovation. They all started with a problem they wanted to solve.

Complication - With some of these pathways being promising, but the entrepreneurs capsule having rudimentar setting and limited fuel. The willingness to find a solution in a new world, a given path of effort, pulls. Part of them want to visit planet X because of love, part of them seem to know that time is moving, that fuel is being used. The complication is that, even when new data comes their way, such as insights from the team about management of resources, they fail to manage the fuel of the critical energy unit, the human being and each individual. The answer to the problem lies in respecttime and to know that time is relative. 

Scaling models affects time reality -- capsules of models -  unconscious about unit of resources and investing bet, analysis of models of support, parallel realities.  -  Models do what? Framwork? Incubation? Tools, frameworks, traction with customers?  With some of these pathways being promising, but the entrepreneurs capsule having rudimentar setting and limited fuel. The willingness to find a solution in a new world, a given path of effort, pulls. Part of them want to visit planet X because of love, part of them seem to know that time is moving, that fuel is being used. The complication is that, new data comes their way, such as insights from the team about management of resources, they fail to manage the fuel of the critical energy unit, the human being and each individual. The answer to the problem lies in respecttime and to know that time is relative. Could, perhaps, connect with how entrepreneurial journeys start. Perhaps the idea of "I will make a startup" fits in a wider bucket, in the end of the day. Let's be honest, and for that we need to look at some of the patters of growth, in terms of organizations. Some startups start with the ideal to scale fast but then notice that the area/domain chosen might need some other strategy for that. In Blitzscaling, Reid and Chris bring about the fact, or the test, that are things that could indeed have a scaling nature. But then, what happens with the entrepreneur, the team, founders call it whatever you want that are into something and then out of the sudden comes to notive a big - oh, wait, I thought I was doing X with a Y model but reality is different. I thought I knew how relativity works. And the metaphor here, slightly implied, of an entrepreneur that dives in a space journey within a capsure warping hyperfast, sort of believing that she is strong and that the thin layer won't break, is in fact, when new worlds are ahead, going to come across such big waves and the real experience of being there, where time seems to move slow, but when they come back from these journeys, hopefully alive to experience and tell what has happened, they are then, to start that experience by first notice that time has moved too fast for whowever where down to earth. And then, sayings such as "I thought I was making a startup, that would have time to visit that planet and come back with a solution to people from Earth" but this mission, lazarous , somehoew brought me here, older and I hope wisier, to tell that reality is different. And I don't even know if I went there in the first palce to save the people from earth. Maybe I am just wanted to learn what is out there. We should keep annotated, that some of these astronauts do find interesting new worlds and ways to change reality of earth, and ways to impact people from earth. When that journey involves the right team, the right planet, and a lot of learning that helps them to assemble what they need, on the go, or when they get support from the beings of a higher dimension, yes, it seems to be amazing journey. Is what I hear from people that reported on the actual life journeys. 

## Recognition of experintial learning 

* scqa - Respect kolb, Respect the individual, and establish learning about self. Consider let it go and the post-mortem freedom of that. Respect time of team - and respect management. Consider team let it go and the post-mortem freedom of that. Respect time of investing and respect risk. Consider let it go and the post-mortem freedom of that.  Respect the investing nature for anything that has risk involved and the balancing of execution, or commitment activities, with aspirational or important strategic activities that closes the gap with the future, brings a different future potential, but may need effort for time-space. 

A realidade é que não temos o tempo, do mundo. À medida que enfrentamos desafios e prioridades concorrentes, nos encontramos na difícil situação de tentar criar mais tempo para fazer o que precisa ser feito. Mas a verdade é que o tempo é um recurso limitado e, mesmo que quiséssemos, não poderíamos simplesmente "abrir mais tempo". Em vez disso, o que precisamos é aprender a gerenciar nosso tempo de maneira mais eficiente.

Isso começa com o reconhecimento de que a unidade fundamental de qualquer empreendimento, seja uma startup ou uma grande corporação, são as pessoas. Cada indivíduo, seja fundador, membro da equipe ou colaborador, contribui com sua energia única para a organização. E essa energia precisa ser respeitada e administrada de forma eficaz.

Não podemos simplesmente abrir mais tempo para tarefas importantes, como quem utiliza o tempo que já tem com o urgente mas deixa uma nova pauta - abrir mais tempo para essa outra exploração. Precisamos garantir que o tempo dedicado a tarefas seja bem utilizado. Isso implica permitir que cada pessoa faça sua parte, respeitando seu tempo e sua energia.

Podemos falar algo a mais aqui, não? SObre o respeito a energia do ser humano e sobre a criação de modelos de permissão para certas análises em outra perspectiva. 

A partir dessa ideia, precisamos considerar o investimento necessário no processo onde a execução depende de aprendizado. Em outras palavras, é necessário contabilizar a natureza cíclica do processo e o tempo nas etapas como experimentação, reflexão, conceitualização e aplicação [^kolbmodel]. Em outras palavras, reconhecer o tempo para errar e aprender enquanto executamos. O equilíbrio entre esses fatores é crucial para um gerenciamento eficiente.

[^kolbmodel]: O modelo de Kolb é uma teoria de aprendizagem experiencial, que postula que a aprendizagem é um processo que envolve quatro etapas: experimentação concreta, observação reflexiva, conceitualização abstrata e experimentação ativa. Este ciclo de aprendizagem foi proposto por David A. Kolb, que argumentou que essas quatro etapas são críticas para a compreensão e a aplicação efetivas de novos conceitos e habilidades. O espaço entre a reação e o planejamento é onde o verdadeiro empreendedorismo prospera. Neste espaço, aprendemos a nos adaptar às realidades do mercado e a encontrar tempo para planejar e refletir.

A boa notícia é uma triste notícia. Em geral, demanda um preparo de coragem, mais do que dedicação, para explorar o equilíbrio. Explorar porque não sabemos exato o que é esse espaço de equilíbrio. Ao respeitar nosso próprio tempo - assim como o tempo dos que trabalham conosco - e ao reconhecer que cada um de nós contribui com uma energia única e ao dedicar tempo à aprendizagem em equipe, podemos, em primeiro lugar, ter sucesso na questão do crescimento interno do(s) empreendedor(es), do time, o que é crítico para qualquer sucesso no ambiente do time, na cultura, que faz o resultado do empreendedorismo e mais chances para a cultura de crescimento. Ou seja, crescimento interior é crucial para qualquer crescimento no mundo do empreendedorismo. Isso é evoluir no processo e o processo. 

Talvez faça sentido encontrar algum dado onde alguém diz que Reid Hoffman é muito bom em fazer uma lista do que tem que ser feito e cortar ela no meio, ou seja, ignorar as partes de baixo.
