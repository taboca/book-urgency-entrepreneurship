# Running 

There is something about the entrepreneurial situaion of a startup in the growth situation that is not different from the life of any doer, the worker. Reid Hoffman carries a saying in his pocket, one which nailed a good deal of characterizations of one in the startup situation, as one where "you throw yourself off a cliff and you assemble an airplane on the way down," (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2013). Now, and writing this paragraph and after hearing these words, the pressure I feel sets me to first think that time is short and that something must be learned. We will get there too, but if I let a pause to set in, another profound implication of that situation is the one that explains too the situation of the "startup of you," or the life of the doer, the worker, that all that we do starts with the realization that, right there, falling or sliding in the tracks of the workday, our start point is to operate, from the notion that we are somebody, with the knowing that we know, not being free fro mthe ways of execution as we know, with the skills we carry on. 

This is the start point for this chapter, as this chapter celebrates our ability to run, as we first have to acknowledge that to be able to run is a human trait, and as we recognize our inclinations to be running. In other words, and although we want to be that somebody - as we have celebrated in the first chapter - we also know that all that we do only works if we are accept ourselves as being somebody. in a way or another. Can I play? I shall play. Can I run? I shall run. Can I learn? I shall learn. With that considered, and to align with the point from Reid, the point for this chapter has too to do with the consideration that running in the same say, as the same somebody, does not take us there, as individuals or as start-ups considering that both are in a mission of growth. Thus, we are here, in the end of this part, to connects with the need to face becoming somebody else, if we aim for impact.

The entrepreneur embarks on an uncertain path where success isn't guaranteed. In this situation, it means we are set to execute and learn. Indeed, we might have a "partial vision" although we lack the "how-to." However, we are inclined to take shortcuts, a human trait perhaps stemming from inspiration, motivation, and planning.

As we proceed, we operate with the tools at hand, like a hammer, ready to strike. We allocate time for hammering, and hammer we do. Yet, we often neglect to reserve time for transcendence—to step back and evaluate our primary activity, whether it's writing, music, or the very act of hammering. This stepping back allows us to observe from a vantage point not of the body doing the work but from an enlightened space outside it. It's here we see the need to add new roles, tools, or a hybrid of the two. When we set ourselves in this reflective situation, we then account when transformation is necessary, yet we're unsure what it takes, aware that change may come with a level of discomfort, may seem as cost, or pain. A hammer cannot easily become pliers or scissors, and the belief that it must can cause distress. For instance, the notion that we must become experts in a new field is daunting and unrealistic.

Returning to the hammer metaphor, we face a dilemma, but here are some responses: A) We don't need to become experts—that's a misconception. No one expects a real transformation into pliers, for instance. B) Addressing emotions, reflecting on pains and feelings, and incorporating these into our actions allow for mistakes and learning opportunities. Entrepreneurship should facilitate this dialogue, just as a writer maintains a diary of fears and aspirations that might otherwise hinder their work. And C), reflecting on the ways to achieve impact which essentially depends on recontextualizing the hopes and fears from the present, projecting the hopes and fears to the future as a way to find the right strategy and movement, decisions for now.
