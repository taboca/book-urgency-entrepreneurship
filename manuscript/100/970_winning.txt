# The mesh of success 

Defining success is a great way to help you check if you are serious about entrepreneurship. I will give it straight, a version of success that perhaps you already know unlike success as normally seen, perhaps a colder version, a healthy state for an entrepreneurial life, beyond your immediate entrepreneurial goal of now, the goal of being someone. 

In the past, pursuing success wasn't a choice. The situation for seeking success is modern and comes after the knowledge worker. In the pursuit of success, however, it is not uncommon for us to go away from success. We run the risk of not accepting mistakes, which prevent us from learning after mistakes, we might become less creative as we become controllers in the face of the need to adapt to the challenges ahead. 

The complication, especially when the matter is an entrepreneurial effort such as when we dig in the startup journey, is that we find ourselves as someone but do not nurture the being of someone. This is not intentional, as in pre-planned, it can be result from our urgency to control the outcome, but it connects with distancing from what we care and who we are, we run the risk of losing connection with our integrity. With that, is lose a key result, or key needed element, that need to be maintained for any endeavor where a guide doesn't exist and where we need to be ready when the plan does not go as expected, such as to pivot or to give up the format.

In honoring the enlighted success route, which indeed has to do with inner success, we expect to be someone across the present day and aside from any failure, to advance our lives more than advancing the moment as a career. We will fist consider that to be someone we need to release our controller; that an entrepreneurial journey happens in a space of growth, where things change, the game becomes different, and the rules change, which can be frightening. We need to be humble and, again, renew/be someone. 

## The successful, the controller, and no one 

Peter Drucker, the father of the adminstration [^druckerfatheradm], brought up the subject of winning, or seeking success, as part of his article entitled Managing Oneself; pointing that the expectation for success didn't exist before the knowledge economy: 

[^druckerfatheradm]: 

> "In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. Historically, there was no such thing as "success." The overwhelming majority of people did not expect anything but to stay in their "proper station," as an old English prayer has it. The only mobility was downward mobility. In a knowledge society, however, we expect everyone to be a  success. This is clearly an impossibility. For a great many people, there is at best an absence of failure. Wherever there is success there has to be failure. And then it is vitally important for the individual, and equally for the individual's family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a diference, and be **somebody**. " (Drucker, 2008, pp. 53-54)

--> 

Therefore, if no one hand there is a seekness for success as one does "their job", the other viewpoint, which can be obvious but very difficult to see from the perspective of the executor, that success can't be controled. On the other hand, Peter suggests how stability can be brought to lfe of the executor in the face of the truth where execution is subject to failure. The solution lies in splitting the person: The job of the founder and the life of the person. The role of the founder and the role of the manager that supports the founder. 

This mechanism is not unknown to us, of course. We know that is not uncommon for one that fails big to later come back as a new person. Actually in fact, a lot of stories of actual success comes after the fact of major failures, although most of stories are so short and focusing in the achievements [ as you will read in the part 3 about narratives] that the what has happened before is taken out. Perhaps the world does not have time for that. But we know that anyway. 

Therefore, when it is time to plan the activities and the stories of entrepreneurship, we can and should focus on the proper management of the self with investments in this area. As an example, you can read Peter Drucker's article. But it all starts with a reflective moment and this is now our opportunity here, to start to reason that we can't control the outcome, we can't control success. At least from an extremme perspective, it is very clear, that the total controller, that wants to manipulate the results, it just speeding up towards failure. And the other extremme we know it does not work either, that the one that does not care at all about success is more like taking a road without having a destination in mind. 

But Peter's viewpoint is enlightening as it does not suggest to our controller role to be less of a controller, or to try to regulate the wish to control with a bit of a dosage of sanity and perspective. That effort, such as when we do engage in the mechanisms to gain perspective, should of course gives us perspective. The light in Peter Drucker's comment really touches the meaning of success for the human being, the indivual, that is the difficult place since the success and failure of the job is present at all times, and since the situation in the end of the day can be one or other and, of course, it is all relative. When relativeness is applied to the outcome that is being considered, the result of the provocation implies in giving a new perspective to the outcome and to put, or bring up, outcomes for the being, in the equation.

From that angle, one could argue that the outcome of one that seeks material success,  for example, from the perspective of the protagonist, is other more abstract notion of success that is associated with that first success, such as happiness. But thinking that the success of the higher order is a consequence of the success of the present order, such as the job, is an error in the interpretation, likely when we are too fast. 

What Peter is giving us here is, again, a perspective. If we lock in, accept and trust, that what we do with the job can be either successful or can fail, then the question is: How can I propose a successful situation for the one that carries that job? Or better, what conditions I have to propose to that "other person" in a way that he or she is successful even when he or she fails in the job? It is unexcapable that the one that needs to prepare for winnning or losing needs to be, as Peter wrote, somebody. The somebody that is yet alive after a big fail is likely one that listens. He or she is likely one that reflects. He or she is likely one that learns. He or she is likely one that is happy with either winning and not winning. If we explore now what would be the us that can get a job and complete the job and still be happy, we will start exploring the space of supporting ourselves, of respecting ourselves, or planning for what has to be done that never ignores the plan for the healthy mind of the protagonist. In a way is not different from what you would to to you children if she or he is entering a championship but has a long life ahead. Solve that situation and you have success solved and likely more chances to be successful in the job as well. 

## Scaling the inner self

The idea of preservation of the self, being someone, should be recognized in the long run. Consider the entrepreneurial setting of a startup that faces the potential for scaling. There is simply no way to expect scaling of a startup without the growth of the executive team involved. 

The challenges for adaptability of the self, the founding team, was brought by when Reid Hoffman, when he interviewed Brian Chesky wondering how truthful is the thesis of "What got you here does not get you there. " We should keep in mind that Airbnb went through the various stages of growth from Blitzscaling [^footnote_blizscaling_growth_stages] - family, tribe, village, city and nation. In this context, Brian points a strange perception, as a kind of question he used to get from people about Airbn, that growing a company is mostly about its founding days and then things goes like "you have this idea, it takes off, and you just gotta find a way to manage it." 

> *"I think stage one is actually fairly straight forward. [..] I don't think it's that complicated and even if it is, it's well written about. But the thing after that, there's not a lot of books about and everyone gives you the wrong advice. You gotta figure it out and you're kinda on your own. And the risk is, if I ask a CEO how to manage and they work at a huge company, they're gonna tell me the wrong thing. It's like you talk about you're skating, but it's not ice it's water. The ice skates don't work yet. We invited a former CEO over, and he gave me this piece of advice I'll never forget. He said, "Every six months you keep your job "it's a promotion." I almost think, in hindsight, it's better to say every six months is a totally different job. So it's not like this metaphor of you're an athlete and you're a tennis player and you play small tournaments and you work your way up. You start playing tennis, then you're like a bowler, then you're like a football player and then you're playing hockey. The job changes so much, you're almost playing a different sport every job."*

In other words, the self-awareness of the executor should embody its state of well being that characteristically releases control - for when the things they so passionately involve are challenged - in the face of external environment that changes significantly. Steve Blank highlights when a founder state of a firm believer - which is likely a characteristic of great founders - provokes emotional reaction that reaffirms its beliefs: 

> *"[If] they tell you that your baby is ugly, smoke is going to start coming out of your ears because cognitive dissonance is going to set in. You are a believer and now they are telling you that you are wrong? Are these people stupid? Which is - the first reaction of a great founder is: They just don’t get it."*

The situation pointed by Steve is not easy for any entrepreneur since what moves entrepreneurship forward might well be connected with that is thought as the job, such as goals or an outcome ahead. This is exactly the part that deserves a reflective moment - the identification of your whole, the elements that make one to be someone beyond what they are currently doing. It's quite challenging, especially for founders that excited with whatever they envisioned, to pause and reflect, to pull the elements that can support them to be someone that serves the now and the future. 

### Split the love

Before we move to the following part, which is a reflection about the well being that puts us in the right place to do a job well, I want to keep in sync with the idea of splitting yourself and to indicate that this notion can bring organization that is precise to what you have ahead of you. Consider what I do for my start-up, for example. I am proposing an startup that is quite agressive and wants to put a dent in the universe. It might use AI and other elements that are considered hot. It also promises to the customer target, the people with a need, that their professional lives will be better. But the job I do is an effort. And it is because I need to trust that the bad outcome is a possibility that I have to solve a problem. An example, I do have a customer. She is a psychologist and the so-far-product helps her. But the product might out of the sudden disappear. What should I do? What is the current plan that can split success when the actual "platform" can be broken? 

Consider the possibility of a contract that you can write with yourself. Where I said, or wrote, that I am doing an effort of work to help her. And, in case of failure of the start-up, the response plan is to do XYZ, such as to help her continue to improve her life. I can, for example, give to her the data of the project so that she can continue the work with others. Such as she feel that there is respect. Notice that a principle of well-being for the long run is present here and it is organizing the present situation of the start-up, for the customer, and as well for myself as a founder. 

One other component based on the same principle, that what I do is published, kept alive, so that the work I do can be seen. Therefore, and since controlling success is not possible, I can at least focus on progress. I can update my résumé constantly while doing the job. I can improve myself in being on time. I can improve my writing. I can study subjects. I lean listen. I can course-correct the plan after failing. These are traits of success that can be secured, for the person, aside from the actual effort of execution. A lot of professionals are quite professionals even when they are working for companies that had funding but out of the sudden the funding dries out. These folks can still have jobs after. And these folks should have a life always. 

The notion for splitting the love resonates with the view of the present salesman vs. future enlighted salesman which is pointed by Abraham Maslow in Maslow on Managenent. 

## Searching integration 

The sort of analogous situation of the firm believer, might happen with many when they face the reality of jobs, is that they embrace certain ways of operation that are tied to the culture. But the sort of embrace the mechanics of it to a point that what they do, and how they do, is affected by the mechanics. That is nothing much wrong about that as execution art chimes in, it is as if we start to get used and start to see. It's good news that the way towards is less blurry. 

The phenomenon, in the workplace, and it is also everywhere in our system of working, is that we run the risk of entering into certain "execution tracks," such as when we get a job, we become the job. And then we run X periods of time following an execution routine that does not involve the time to visit, or to enter, into that other experience that brought us to be who we were, before we have entered the execution track (or the job, or executing a start-up) in the first place. This is when we start to lose that connection as the result of just being there. As a result of just working. No time to fly towards the sun and come back - if you were a birdman. No time to step over the stones that made you unique, such as that brought you to consider the very idea that you are motivated. When we are "in the job," we follow trails; because it is how things works, the survival route, the promotion route, it's the only way. And there are other names to that, to many words that pulls our focus in the track, we become the track. 

The situation leads to a sort of fusion with the art being done which is perhaps not unlike an artist's block. But the founder's block goes all the way towards the identity - they can't be someone anymore. 

In the search for maintaing the self across the challenging setting, we shall count with the wisdom of Julia Cameron, the author of The Artist's Way and On Writing Well. According to Julia Cameron, in The Right to Write (1998, p.66), a writer that is committed to being a writer pulls things to write from a well, as in the source, and it does well for a while. But as a result of their success, of pulling things from that well and which is part of the job of writing, they find that their well goes empty.

It could be that a beginner founder, like a beginner writer, does not even know how dependent they are, of that well as a source. That place, if they knew well enough how it works, would be considered sacred. But like for most of us, beginners in the craft of creation, it could be that that we went there, many times, that they visited that well, and then their body of experience brought them to a readiness level. 

But then, with that, it is like we get involved with the mechanism our delivery and the mechanics for bringing things to the world, such as to pages, products that can be consumed by others. This part of the process, which is science and art it itself, may not help us to see that we have visited that well in the first place. We might think: How I came to write about that? How was I able to bring that product (or production, or project) to the world? In other words, as any job unfolds, we don't have the time to talk about what connect us with what we do, if there are underlying values or things that inspire us, that keep us going. Such subject simply can't be part of the conversations in the job. 

The prompt that Julia Cameron promotes, which depends on nurturing that well, works for a writing life indeed. But it can be a good reflection for the life of an entrepreneur or anyone that wants to achieve lasting success. She wrote, from Right to Write: 

> *"If we are invested in a writing life - as opposed to a writing career - then we are in it for the process and not for the product. We are in it for the body of work and not for the quick hit one one well-realized piece. This means we must treat ourselves as valued athletes who must be kept in condition and not overraced or overtrained."*  (Julia Cameron, 1998, p.66)

The provocation of Julia lifts us towards the reality that we can be fixed towards a "one well-realized piece" ignoring what brought us there. Notice her differentiating life from career. Ins't it a bit like the phenomenon of a company that hired someone that had a life, before, and then develops a career? 

She is asking writers, the ones that want to become good writers, do see the process beyond the present moment. When founders run their start-ups like careers, even when they join after coming from a great experience that brought them to start the project, they can't tell which places they have visited that served to them as the energy, or the source of creative power, and which helps them to be able to work, to deliver. Sometimes we can sort of bring the bits and pieces of it. And worse, when founders - such as the ones that achieved known success - are interviewed about some good job they did, they are unable to skim the subject and really tell what brought them there in the first place. We just enter entrepreneurship with some arbitrary notions of what we did before. We look into that fusion space and project bits and pieces as the things we pulled of. We enter entrepreneurship thinking that our success has nothing much to do with that well, and that that well has nothing to do with our well being. 

What founders can't see, that brings them to the resulting phenomenon - or felling stalled and having perceptions such as "we are not motivated as we were" or "things are not working" or "the market is not accepting" and the many variations of that -  is that we might have another underlying reason to be there, to being someone in that process. 

Julia pointed a situation of a television executive that started as a producer with a goal of doing good to the world but caught himself in a kind of existential crisis as his "inner reality and his outer world no longer mesh" (1998, p.108). She elaborated about his mechanism of crisis management consisting of a daily writing exercise that takes in consideration his value system, where he is okay with discomfort, where he states his dreams, where he brings the reality he faces, where he can be conscious about himself. The reflective writing exercise of the executive celebrates how one checks on his integrity. 

The success we seek, ultimately, is not arrive at a scene as beings that somehow had stumbled in a state of well being; so that we brought ourselves in the readiness level where we can pull an idea of the hat and then success is measured from our ability to execute and deliver to the world, keep pulling from a hat. As the matter depends on embracing the creative state of well being - which is a requirement for entrepreneurship - we must seek to understand that success is success in the long run, that we need to nurture ourselves to be able to pull solutions from the well as much as keep experiencing and act to fill that well. And that such effort has to be done also at an individual level, for everyone involved. 

## Extended integration 

* Consider the situation with Blitzscaling, p.289 and p.301 for the responsible Blitzscaling and requirement of Blitzscaling for the entrepreneur, which is to be an always learner, p.301, and also what Reid and Chris referred as paradox, p.301, which has to do with a need for estability and peace, which is a requirement which seems to aligh with diversity. 

Therefore, we want to focus in our beings as supporters for the projects of now but without losing ties with the projects of after. There is no way to advance with entrepreneurship without facing the reality that you need to be around, as things change in front of you. What I care about, that helps me to support this line of conduct, is that I care about you and want you to be around, winning. 

I want you to advance your life, to improve yourself on the way, to improve your team, and your organization. Therefore, it is a conscious winning, an enlighted winning, a winning idea. And with that, to help the world with your energy, alive. As you engage with teams, I want you to do it in a way that they shall be interested in staying around, you. As you launch your ideas into the world, I also want you to do it in a way that people are helping, you.
