Defining winning is a great way to help you check if you are serious about entrepreneurship. I will put upfront, I will give it straight, our version of winning here which you already know. It is not about winning, in the way we might normally engage with that idea, the kind of winning that we sometimes seek, when we are trying to control the outcome. Don't get me wrong, I respect that the idea of going for something with goal set and that putting an effort for that is key - there is nothing wrong with that. And within that angle that are too many ideas, too many resources availble. But there is another kind of winning that is more complex and perhaps applicable to the entrepreneurial endeavor of one and their team. Perhaps a colder winning, not so hot. 

The winning I am referring to is a healthy state for your entrepreneurial life, beyond your immediate entrepreneurial goal of now. The ideas presented in this book - which I like to call them moments for reflection - were crafted to help you with that journey. Yes they can be helpful to the steps that for the project of now; but without losing ties with the project of after. What I care about that helps me to support this line of conduct is simple: I care about you and want you to be around. I want you to advance your life, to improve yourself on the way. Therefore, it is a conscious, or enlighted winning, winning idea. And with that, to help the world with your energy. As you engage with teams, I want you to do it in a way that they shall be interested in staying around you. As you launch your ideas into the world, I also want you to do it in a way that people are helping you.
