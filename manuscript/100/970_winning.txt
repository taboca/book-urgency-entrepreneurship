Defining winning is a great way to help you check if you are serious about entrepreneurship. I will put upfront, I will give it straight, our version of winning here perhaps you already know. It is not about winning, in the way we might normally engage with that idea, the kind of winning that we sometimes seek, when we are trying to control the outcome. I respect that the idea of going for something with goal set and that putting an effort for that is key - there is nothing wrong there. But there is another kind of winning that is more complex and applicable to the entrepreneurial endeavor of one and their team. Perhaps a colder sort of winning, not so hot. The winning I am referring to is a healthy state for your entrepreneurial life, beyond your immediate entrepreneurial goal of now. 

The ideas presented in this book - which I like to call them moments for reflection - were crafted to help you with that journey, that viewpoint, of a healthy and conscious state of being to support your life. Therefore, we want to focus in our beings as supporters for the projects of now but without losing ties with the projects of after. There is no way to advance with entrepreneurship without facing the reality that you need to be around, as things change in front of you. What I care about, that helps me to support this line of conduct, is that I care about you and want you to be around, winning. 

I want you to advance your life, to improve yourself on the way, to improve your team, and your organization. Therefore, it is a conscious winning, an enlighted winning, a winning idea. And with that, to help the world with your energy, alive. As you engage with teams, I want you to do it in a way that they shall be interested in staying around, you. As you launch your ideas into the world, I also want you to do it in a way that people are helping, you.

## When we started to expect to control success 

Peter Drucker, the father of the adminstration [^druckerfatheradm], brought up the subject of winning, or seeking success, as part of his article entitled Managing Oneself; pointing that the expectation for success didn't exist before the knowledge economy: 

> "In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. Historically, there was no such thing as "success." The overwhelming majority of people did not expect anything but to stay in their "proper station," as an old English prayer has it. The only mobility was downward mobility. In a knowledge society, however, we expect everyone to be a  success. This is clearly an impossibility. For a great many people, there is at best an absence of failure. Wherever there is success there has to be failure. And then it is vitally important for the individual, and equally for the individual's family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a diference, and be **somebody**. " (Drucker, 2008, pp. 53-54)

Therefore, if on one hand there is a seekness for success as one does "their job", the other viewpoint, which can be obvious but very difficult to see from the perspective of the executor, that success can't be controled. On the other hand, Peter suggests how stability can be brought to lfe of the executor in the face of the truth where execution is subject to failure. The solution lies in splitting the person: The job of the founder and the life of the person. The role of the founder and the role of the manager that supports the founder. 

This mechanism is not unknown to us, of course. We know that is not uncommon for one that fails big to later come back as a new person. Actually in fact, a lot of stories of actual success comes after the fact of major failures, although most of stories are so short and focusing in the achievements [ as you will read in the part 3 about narratives] that the what has happened before is taken out. Perhaps the world does not have time for that. But we know that anyway. 

Therefore, when it is time to plan the activities and the stories of entrepreneurship, we can and should focus on the proper management of the self with investments in this area. As an example, you can read Peter Drucker's article. But it all starts with a reflective moment and this is now our opportunity here, to start to reason that we can't control the outcome, we can't control success. At least from an extremme perspective, it is very clear, that the total controller, that wants to manipulate the results, it just speeding up towards failure. And the other extremme we know it does not work either, that the one that does not care at all about success is more like taking a road without having a destination in mind. 

But Peter's viewpoint is enlightening as it does not suggest to our controller role to be less of a controller, or to try to regulate the wish to control with a bit of a dosage of sanity and perspective. That effort, such as when we do engage in the mechanisms to gain perspective, should of course gives us perspective. The light in Peter Drucker's comment really touches the meaning of success for the human being, the indivual, that is the difficult place since the success and failure of the job is present at all times, and since the situation in the end of the day can be one or other and, of course, it is all relative. When relativeness is applied to the outcome that is being considered, the result of the provocation implies in giving a new perspective to the outcome and to put the ultimate outcome of the being above all. From that angle, one could argue that the outcome of one that seeks material success,  for example, from the perspective of the protagonist, is other more abstract notion of success that is associated with that first success, such as happiness. But thinking that the success of the higher order is a consequence of the success of the present order, such as the job, is an error in the interpretation and context provided by Peter. What Peter is giving us here is, again, a perspective. If we lock in, accept and trust, that what we do with the job can be either successful or can fail, then the question is: How can I propose a successful situation for the one that carries that job? Or better, what conditions I have to propose to that "other person" in a way that he or she is successful even when he or she fails in the job? It is unexcapable that the one that needs to prepare for winnning or losing needs to be, as Peter wrote, somebody. The somebody that is yet alive after a big fail is likely one that listens. He or she is likely one that reflects. He or she is likely one that learns. He or she is likely one that is happy with either winning and not winning. If we explore now what would be the us that can get a job and complete the job and still be happy, we will start exploring the space of supporting ourselves, of respecting ourselves, or planning for what has to be done that never ignores the plan for the healthy mind of the protagonist. In a way is not different from what you would to to you children if she or he is entering a championship but has a long life ahead. Solve that situation and you have success solved and likely more chances to be successful in the job as well. 

Before we move to the following part which is a reflection about the well being that puts us in the right place to do a job well, I want to keep in sync with the idea of splitting yourself and to indicate that this notion can bring organization that is precise to what you have ahead of you. Consider what I do for my start-up, for example. I am proposing an startup that is quite agressive and wants to put a dent in the universe. It might use AI and other elements that are considered hot. It also promises to the customer target, the people with a need, that their professional lives will be better. But the job I do is an effort. And it is because I need to trust that the bad outcome is a possibility that I have to solve a problem. An example, I do have a customer. She is a psychologist and the so-far-product helps her. But the product might out of the sudden disappear. What should I do? What is the current plan that can split success when the actual "platform" can be broken? It is a sort of a contract that I wrote to myself. Where I said, or wrote, that I am doing an effort of work to help her. And, in case of failure of the start-up, the response plan is to do XYZ, such as to help her continue to improve her life. I can, for example, give to her the data of the project so that she can continue the work with others. Such as she feel that there is respect. Notice that a principle of well-being for the long run is present here and it is organizing the present situation of the start-up, for the customer, and as well for myself as a founder. One other component based on the same principle, that what I do is published, kept alive, so that the work I do can be seen. Therefore, and since controlling success is not possible, I can at least shown my progress. I can update my résumé constantly while doing the job. I can improve myself in being on time. I can improve my writing. I can study subjects. I lean listen. I can course-correct the plan after failing. These are traits of success that can be secured, for the person, aside from the actual effort of execution. A lot of professionals are quite professionals even when they are working for companies that had funding but out of the sudden the funding dries out. These folks can still have jobs after. And these folks should have a life always. 

## Keep filling your well 

As we seek for the winning condition of us as human beings, I want to start with the story of how I end up working at a well-known Silicon Valley company, a few Silicon Valley chapters before the Silicon Valley as we know it. Those were the days of the Silicon Valley of the browser days [^siliconvalleyofbrowserdays]. Before I arrived in Silicon Valley I was a sort of not so normal student. Seeing by collegues as creative, wearing an unusual outfit, always in the lab. I got in in 1993, when the movie Jurrassic Park was out. At the same time the Internet was also fresh. So I had the reasons to be in the lab and not to pay attention to the classes of the Computer Science course. Then later I was sort of invited to focus and complete, as opposed to leave university, when I was approaching 8 years, by 2000. I did a lot of things in there, made too many friends, had fun and also did some of the stuff that brought me the job at the company, at the time well-known, called Netscape. When I joined Netscape I might have normalized myself. There were too many new things, and excitement, and new systems in place keeping me in the line. So I would say that a bit of normalization started to happen. And it makes sense, doesn't? Except that it also happens that we enter work environments and start to learn how to climb our way using the stones in a big wall, as opposed to challenge the stones. 

[^siliconvalleyofbrowserdays]: The phrase "Silicon Valley of the browser days" refers to the timeframe during the late 1990s to early 2000s when the web was in its early stages of development and the Silicon Valley was at the center of it. This period is noted for the creation and enhancement of web browsers, marking the dawn of a new digital era. Pioneering tech companies based in Silicon Valley, such as Netscape with its Navigator browser, played significant roles in shaping the internet as we know it today. During this time, the evolution of web browsers led to a shift from the static HTML pages of the early Internet to the dynamic, interactive web experiences we are familiar with now.

The sort of analogous situation, or pattern, that happens with many when they face the reality of jobs, is that they embrace certain ways of operation that are tied to the culture. But the sort of embrace the mechanics of it to a point that what they do, and how they do, is affected by the mechanics. 

That is nothing much wrong about that except that we seem to be captivated by the operational model which eventually seems to prevent us to do come out with new ideas when it is needed. The thing with the normal course of jobs is perhaps not much different of what the screenwriting professor Robert McKee said about the situation that young screenwriters face, after they learn how to use cliches, which is that they sell their soul, as in there is no return. 

It is wasn't different for me. I got a job, as I had talents of a new kind. Then I found a place where people seem to climb using other skills. And I sort tried to figure the general function of climbing. Actually, I didn't try to do that on my own, trying to hack the system, or trying to find a legit way to play the game. The system it itself were telling me to operate like that, with things such as performance reviews. By the way, the system recognized my talents, the sort of things that somehow we bring from the outside, the things that brought me into the job as well. But it is as if the system does not want to mess with that too much. I once received a compliment of a employee that said "Marcio, whatever you are smoking, please keep doing that."  

But that compliment also is revealing of something else. That we don't care where and what is your well - your well of creative thinking that makes you unique. Do that and come back. Or more precisely do that before you come in. During the week, we expect you to vomit that thing onto our system and we expect that you can normalize those things into our products. 

So the phenomenon, in the workplace, and it is also everywhere in our system of working, is that we run the risk of entering into certain "execution tracks," such as when we get a job. And then we run X amoung of years following an execution routine that does not involve the time to visit, or to enter, into that other experience that brought us to be who we were, before we have entered the execution track (or the job, or executing a start-up) in the first place. 

This is when we start to lose that connection as the result of just being there. As a result of just working. No time to fly towards the sun and come back - if you were a birdman. No time to step over the stones that makes one unique. In the job, we follow trails; because it is how things works, the survival route, the promotion route, it's the only way. And there are other names to that, to many words that pulls our focus back to the track. 

And that model of thinking, a phenomenon, it's everywhere even for the one that thinks she or he is working alone, such as the job of writing. According to Julia Cameron, in The Right to Write (1998, p.66), a writer that is committed to being a writer pulls things to write from a well, as in the source, and it does well for a while. But as a result of their success, of pulling things from that well and which is part of the job of writing, they find that their well goes empty.

It could be that a beginner writer does not even know how dependent they are, of that well as a source. That place, if they knew well enough how it works, would be considered sacred. But like for most of us, beginners in the craft of creation, it could be that that they went there, many times, that they visited that well, and then their body of experience brought them to a readiness level. When they are apt to spit the writing to the world. 

But then, with that, it is like we get involved with the mechanism our delivery and the mechanics for bringing things to the world, such as to pages, products that can be consumed by others. This part of the process, which is science and art it itself, may not help us to see that we have visited that well in the first place. We might think: How I came to write about that? How was I able to bring that product (or production, or project) to the world? 

We could, perhaps think like that, if we had the time to ask that question. And it is not that we are not teased to reflect about that, such as when one gives us a cumpliment of the sort "whatever you are smoking please keep doing that" and the more or less exciting variations of that. But then, as this example shows, these words are strong enough to create such a wall between that (perhaps imaginary) well and our (in fact real) jobs. In other words, most of the work environments don't have time to deal with our sources, with what makes us unique, with what brought us there in the first place, to have ideas, to be motivated, to act on something, to work with an energy that flows. And again, the more we fall into the process of focusing in the outcome, the more we can't see that the outputs that we produce are tied to an input that has to do with the life of the human being behind that. The more we do that the more we disconnect from that well, the well we didn't know it existed in the first place. 

In other words, as any job unfolds, we don't have the time to talk about that well, or any well, or to visit us, to see us. That is too blurry. Such subject simply can't be part of the conversations in the job. And worse, the job conversations can take control of all to the point you think it is yourself. And it is all around because it is a process in us, to not talk about that. And we have a sort of reasoning for that - as approaching this subject is approaching a subject that we don't fully get what goes on there. We do not know how our machine - as humans - fully operate. We know that it does things and we sort of try to rationalize parts of it. And even after the fact that many good real doers, such as good writers and good producers, are telling us about the bits and pieces of how it works, still they do not give a straight and logical guide with a full control about how to operate, how we can control our process that can lead to outcomes. Some of the great minds, when they talk about that well, are more like saying that we depend on it to do our best work. Can we trust? Well, even if we do, we just don't have the time, not usually, not usually in the work place. We rather continue to do well, but under the terms that the job requires, as opposed to visit that other well that brought us to be who we are, the well of experiences. 

The prompt to success that Julia Cameron promotes, which depends on nurturing that well, works for a writing life of a writer and for the life of an entrepreneur or anyone that wants to achieve lasting success. She wrote, from Right to Write: 

> *"If we are invested in a writing life - as opposed to a writing career - then we are in it for the process and not for the product. We are in it for the body of work and not for the quick hit one one well-realized piece. This means we must treat ourselves as valued athletes who must be kept in condition and not overraced or overtrained."*  (Julia Cameron, 1998, p.66)

The provocation of Julia lifts us towards the reality about our idea for success in general. It also reveals our inclination to grab "one well-realized piece" ignoring what brought us there. Notice her differentiating life from career. Ins't it a bit like the phenomenon of a company that hired someone that had a life, before, and then develops a career? She is asking writers, the ones that want to become good writers, do see the process beyond the present moment. 

When founders run their start-ups like careers, even when they join after coming from a great experience that brought them to start the project, they can't tell which places they have visited that served to them as the energy, or the source of creative power, and which helps them to be able to work, to deliver. Sometimes we can sort of bring the bits and pieces of it. And worse, when founders are interviewed about some good job they did, they are unable to skim the subject and really tell what brought them there in the first place. We just enter entrepreneurship with some arbitrary notions of what we did before as if something was smoked. We enter entrepreneurship thinking that our success has nothing much to do with that well, and that that well has nothing to do with our well being. 

One may take a whole life before the readiness level of being able to launch something interesting. One may have visited that well, many wells, too many times. But then that one learns how to write down, or how to tell others, and start thinking that the process of putting it out is the key. Thinking that they hold a key. But eventually, with the key in hands, they might caught themselves unable to open new doors. They keep reopening the same doors. The work situation of that is that one eventually is let go. The writer situation of that is that the writer can't write another great work. The founder situation of that is that founders start to get bored as they find that first customers didn't like their early product, and the changes they produce don't seem to be as exciting as what they thought originally. Or going back to the blurry terms, the person seem to not be smoking anymore. 

The complication in there, although it starts with ourselves not knowing how to bring us into that good state, is that we don't account that time as valid time. The activity that Julia Cameron asks us to do is the sort of activity that starts with the courage because it starts alone. It can't be done with others, such as teams. Visiting the well, and visiting periodically, is about having a date with your internal being, your internal artist, you name it. See where we are going here? An artist, for an entrepreneur? Although weird, perhaps everyone knows it exists somewhere, that sinister thing we can't control or know properly, that partially shows its shadow when we went out and we did something different, perhaps a moment we had with ourselves when having an experience somewhere; that helped us the next day, that changed our minds and gave us a new door to try. 

But even when we sense that we dismiss that thing as not a subject associated with our jobs. The thinking of going for it, having a date with your inner artist, starts as an absurd - it will be onerous. Alone? I can't have time for alone. It might start there or with other objections as it does not fit life as we know it. Not the working life. See, Julia Cameron wrote books for artists and writers. She wrote that even for them is sounds eroneous. Now consider for founders, entrepreneurs, and the normal workers. It's not even a subject to be considered. 

But as we continue to refuse to understand how experiences affect us, we continue to operate as if we are in control, responsible beings, but we might be in fact behaving like gamblers. As in, one visited places and situations, acquired life experience somewhere, gains technical expertise, gets the job, does good, people applaud for her unique way of doing things, and the agenda continue do expect her to deliver from that unique being. She is not allowed to live any experience that is not direct tied to the act of delivery. Whatever she had, that seems to be related to talent, or creativity, is the - in normal work-job terms - her uniqueness. It comes as a cumpliment, the right to do nothing about that. It is a matter outside the job. Notice how we deal with this thing, this weird thing, how we put a wall in there. Better to make a cumpliment. You are special. But a lot of special people are being let go, after a while, working. 

Consider the work of a worker that came fresh from university into a new job, or the "work" of a team of founders that just met an investor. It's the same. What brought them to this winning condition? Whatever you did before. Congrats and welcome to the team. Let's now run faster. You can continue to use your talents, of course, your unique voice, your unique way. Bring your talents, it's okay, but we are not focusing much in developing talents. And we respect everyone aside from their uniqueness. Here matters more execution. We don't want to know what you did before. And we won't even say that too much, the cumplements about talents. It's unfair. Let's keep cranking.  

Which brings us to support the view of Julia Cameron, as a view that works for entrepreneurs as entrepreneurs do a craft that is like the craft of writers. The view that we support recognizes the complication that when one seeks to pursue success, they do not account the the origins of success, not properly. It is our natural inclication,for founders and writers and teams, to enter execution thinking that the "launching of things" is what matters although we might have taken that idea from somewhere else. The non linear nature for how new good ideas happen, or "what goes on with that well," can't be accounted. It is not a valid subject, it's not in the lean process. 

In other words, we are taking advantage of that well, or the process that individuals goes to that well. We want all them to have a life, before. Work spaces of all sorts welcomes that. As long as we keep that well on the other side of the wall. Even the best processes for managing productivity, we know by the top performing and quite creative companies, like Google, show signs that there is something more there. The modern version of OKR - objectives and key results, which is a system for managing how input (actions) ties with output (results) and comes with a system of evaluation against objectives - indicates two modes for operation: commitment and aspirational. The commitment approach is simple, where expected key expected results (of activities performed) are precise such as when one writes that she wants to contact 10 customers. The aspirational approach is when key results are less precise but associated with high expectations, of a soft of higher order, aspirational. In other words, the aspirational key results are there to pulls us to find our ways, which allow creativity to appear the scene. It is reported by great companies running with great teams that high expectations such as beyond reach, or as of aspirational nature, make them bring superb results. But it goes as far as that. Having an aspirational goal does not account that the performer shall visit places to fills her well. It assumes that the person is in good condition to pull things from an existing well. 

But for entrepreneurs, such as founders, we can't ignore that function, that there is a well - which we sort of know - and that you need to fill your well as part of your process. You might need to face the fact that your project depends on your visits to certain places, such as dates with an artist, your inner artist. The situation pointed by Julia for writers is quite applicable to the journey of founders, and entrepreneurs, as founders are in a quest to deliver what wasn't written, what wasn't said, what wasn't done, or produced. As we move towards creating our products, and testing the various elements in it that may serve the needs for the world, we are depending on a creative ecosystem in us, as individuals and as teams. That because, as we have seen it, no plan survives the contact with first customers [^steveblankfootnote2], which put us in the place, in front of the necessity, to be creative again and again. We can't pull from the well if we can't fill the well. 

[^steveblankfootnote2]: As indicated, Steve Blank suggests the idea to illustrate that entrepreneurs launch ideas first and need to adapt to the realities of the market.

What founders can't see, not as clearly as they move with the process, is that their behaviour to engage to the development of an idea has ties with what they discovered before as they got involved with experiences in the world in the first place. Which aligns with the saying "it all starts with a problem you want to solve" [^userinnovationhint]. So they move, start failing and iterating, and things seem to change somehow when the idealized concretes start to fail, as in not accepted by the judges, such as the early people that they have contacted to get feedback, and themselves or other judges. But as they pour more energy, and deliver more concretes to the observers, and the world continues to not respond as expected, their movement with the process naturally pulls them into a place of executing their job without noticing that revising sources of energy (experiences that pulls creative effort) will contribute to the process. The resulting phenomenon is that is brings them into the state of felling stalled and having perceptions such as "we are not motivated as we were" or "things are not working" or "the market is not accepting" and the many variations of that. 

[^userinnovationhint]: The concept of User Innovation (2015, May 19), and the work of Eric von Hippel, involves the idea that people modify tools or create new solutions after the fact that they want to solve real problems.

And worse is when we think that it is the very specific idea, as we have sort of concretized in our minds, the one we pulled from that well, which was the big thing. As in, we become to proud of being the ones that delivered, the ones that have pulled a great thing from that well, that we dismiss that we are the ones that filled the well in the first place. That we gave us a chance to find a problem, to see a problem, in the first place. 

The success we seek, ultimately, is not arrive at a scene as beings that somehow had stumbled in a state of well being; so that we brought ourselves in the readiness level where we can pull an idea of the hat, or a well, and then success is measured from our ability to execute and deliver to the world. As the matter depends on embracing the creative state of well being - which is a requirement for entrepreneurship - we must seek to understand that success is success in the long run, that we need to nurture ourselves to be able to pull solutions from the well as much as keep experiencing and act to fill that well. And that such effort has to be done also at an individual level, for everyone involved.

COntinue to support this with the work of Maslow and entrepreneurship 

In case it seems confusing that creativity now was brought into this article about success, I want to position in in the right direction with a little help from Maslow, add more precision to make a point that the entrepreneur depends on a state of less control which basically connects with the notion of the creative state. Consider the words of Maslow:
