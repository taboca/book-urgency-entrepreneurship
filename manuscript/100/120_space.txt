# The elements in space 

It used to be, at least for me, ridiculous to even consider something like paying for silence, or something closer to that idea such as when one sells a moment of peace. Now we have products and services for that too, a case apparently normal like "an app" for meditation. Seems weird because it's like water - why should I pay for water? Is that simply an effect like a by-product of the situation of abundance? The abundance brought by the possibilities of the digital and networked world we live in? 

Like water, that has lots of products based on water, like water in a bottle or in a box, consider how difficult it is to be aware that of some undelying value in water that might take us to drink all sorts of things that seem to be like water. 

It turns out that we sort of seem to be always on top of a platform. Thus on top of a crazy work, I might find myself in need for balancing the situation, and would for for a walk, or could likely sign up to a program to walk with others or by myself and monitor my steps. And, not uncomon, take water in a box to the walking or gel of water for runners.  

Thus these networks, or platforms, that we use seem to create certain kinds of prisons to us, and we may, eventually, come across an opportunity inside a prison which might be a softer version of a story of one that wrote a book from a prison. 

Therefore we seem to depend on a prison to free ourselves - or to be able to see as if the situation of the platform is a prison. It can happen. Consider, for example, entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley v5 days, the activities and how the industry sets an environment for founders and the general workforce to likely continue to turn the same wheel. Sam Altman wrote an article where he is concerned with a situation, like voices, or the lack of voices, in Silicon Valley and the risk for the innovation potential: 

> "More recently, I’ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for intelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension leave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so toxic. “If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical” was a memorable quote I heard this year."* 
* Sam Altman, https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

> "Political correctness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage." Sam Altman,  https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

There is then a dilemma, to explore or live "of the land." Therefore, on one hand, we might exercise the potential within the space, as in one that becomes expert in the survival in the jungle where they live, therefore they can be somebody playing by the rules. On the other hand, one can be caught in a situation of - or in need of - breaking the rules of a setting, inspired and motivated to reclaim the space under new terms, to rethink the nature of what happens in the space. 

So we either want to succeed within the box or without the box, assuming the entrepreneurial situation where "breaking the box" means that a greater good is given to many involved - or new rules for a better social context. This idea of in or without the box, although can be seen from this general perspective, connects with a famous line from Jim Barksdale from the days when he was the CEO of Netscape [^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]. In an interview by Justin Fox, for Harvard Business Review (Fox, 2014), Jim Barksdale indicated that the line came about during Netscape's public offering roadshow. Jim found himself at the Savoy Hotel in London, pressed for time and facing a room full of British investment bankers. When questioned about Microsoft's potential to bundle a browser into their product, “How do you know that Microsoft isn’t just going to bundle a browser into their product?” he made a statement that would later become an essential business principle: "Gentlemen, there’s only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling." His comment was less a carefully crafted strategy and more a pragmatic observation about the cycles of adding and subtracting features or services in a way that adds value to users and where a business model might happen. 

[^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]: The idea of bundle and unbundle is generally promoted by Marc Andreessen, one of the creators of the first popular internet browser that co-founder of Netscape. Marc is a well-known investor and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, A16z, an iconic venture capital firm from Silicon Valley.

My experience with the notion of platforms, or a stack of platforms, came to my mind a long time ago when I got my first computer around 1985. Video games existed already and it was all exciting but no way for modifying. I couldn't create  or change a game, although could dream and wonder about how things were made. Soon my father bought a personal computer, a quite different box that also had games but an interface that would let me do things. So I met the operating system and also a programming language, the door for change. Needless to say, I took the computer as the thing that enabled the development of games. So I wanted to build one myself. But myself, and the programming language I was using, we were too basic and limited. So I learned that the good games were written in a more complex interface, the machine language, and I had no pointers to understand how to tame that part. Then I tried to do something else. Since I liked to draw, I tried to make a software for drawing, known at the time as a graphics editor. Although that seemed simpler, and I went a bit further, I caught myself again feeling limited. Then, and quite suddenly, I caught myself writing solutions for the adults world, which where simpler. It was when I felt as being somebody - in the world of adults. One lesson was that the language which I tried to make games, or complex things like a graphics editor, were actually more suitable to basic software. That was a platform, had the right things to do, like rules or limits. But I was somebody and doing commercial systems helped me to even make money. Fast-forward 14 years, I caught myself in a Computer Science course and a lot in the labs, doing 3D animation selling video animations, mostly short forms of video commercials for small local companies, which was a possibility given by a popular software for creating 3d models and animations. At that time I also had the chance to start using the Web and understood that the browser - Netscape Communicator - was a tool for visiting web pages but also for making them. So, on top of the computer of the 1990s, I had an operating system and an Internet navigation software which had rules, or limits, for creating web pages. 

So if we view the situation from the lenses of the notion of bundle and unbundle, from Jim and Marc Andreessen, we can look at the situation of a Web developer, a role that it was not possible in the early 1990s. Therefore, it is valid to consider that the internet browser, such as Netscape Navigator, was a bundled box, like a toolbox, it enabled a new kind of software engineer, perhaps not really the same role as a traditional software engineer at the time. But as many organizations were making themselves available in the Web, an economic model and a lot of interactions justified the Web Developer [^footnote_marcio_web_developer].

[^footnote_marcio_web_developer]: The web developer, formed after the Internet browser enabled organizations to make sites and software systems available through web browsers. The web developer would then become a worker for the medium of the Web. https://hackernoon.com/the-history-of-web-developers-tied-to-browser-development

But Web Developers depended on the existance of an Internet browser, such as Netscape Navigator, a bundled product by Netscape Communications. That product, in turn, would run on top of an operating system, such as Windows. And the operating system would run on top of a computer archictecture. And although a lot of elements makes a computer, like a car has a lot beyond its engine, the computer has a computer processor, such as the Intel processor, and the Intel processor is also a bundled elements made of internal elements. If we dig a bit more within the computer processor, we will find transistors, and then we have an opportunity to use the time machine and rewind Silicon Valley to the days where Silicon Valley started.

Looking from the organization perspective, moving slighly away from the user experience, Intel corporation found its way into making computer processors, which was not it's original product. Therefore, and in alignment with the view of Jim Barksdale, the opportunity for Intel to enter the computer processor business was an opportunity that Intel had as they could bundle from an unbundle reality. Before the days of Intel as a processor manufacturer, Intel had the means to build the processor, as they were in the memory making business and had technology to make transistors. The opportunity that Intel saw had an alignment with the emergent widespread of the computer and personal computer entering all sorts of business and homes. 

But even the ways organizations work can also be seen from the bundle/unbundle reality. For Intel, to rearrange itself from a memory manufacturer to a computer processor, a lot had to be modified. Their factories adapted was a view from the above characteristic of the whole structure of the company changing. In other words, Intel had to unbundle themselves to bundle a new Intel, so that it would be possible to deliver a bundled product for their customers, so that the chips goes into personal computers, and run Windows, and on top of Windows, browsers, and on top of browsers, pages. 

Now, if we specificially look at a vital element within the computer chip, the transistor, and we look at the foundation of Intel, as a memory maker, we can trace back that Intel had its origins from Fairchild semiconductor, from Fairchild, about 70+ technology companies. From the organizational perspective, Intel had specific management practices. Intel has also given to the world the book High Output Management, by Andy Grove, where a lot of good management practices had influenced Silicon Valley management development. And if we continue to go back to see how Fairchild semi-conductor was founded, we can find the event known as "the traitor eight", whch was, in a way, an unbundling iminent, of Shockley Semiconductor. Now, this iconic moment in history of Silicon Valley shows how a management approach suffers a tension for unbundling as the management appraoch might also lock in certain future potential. Shockley was founded in the calm West coast, by William Shockley, a co-inventor of the transistor. Why the west cost, he had to move back to live with his mother. Shockley was bright but not a great manager. So, in short, on one hand, imagine the transistor going through its growth, as a technology, and the potential growing too much, as people dreamed about what would be possible. Thus, Shockley William was becoming a gatekeeper in front of what his colleagues saw and what the world needed. The unbundling of Shockley Semiconductor was iminent, and Fairchild came after that. It should be remarked that at the time the idea of leaving a company was not considered fair, therefore one leaving a company would be a traitor. But that idea was also about to be unbundled from the culture. The bundling of Shockley, and the bundling of Fairchild Semiconductor, and the unbundling of "Fairchild" into 70+ bundled organizations is also reflective of a situaution when a technological change happens across the board. 

Then the complication really comes from the potential and the network. Doing something on the bundled platform, platforming adding to it. Or reconsidering the platform, reinventing. The complication is that the platform becomes your terrain, where all happens, like a playground. But something like the Web, such a playground. Or consider the popular platforms for producing "apps" for mobile devices, Google Play or the Apple Store. Developers become the builders on top of those, a community around the methods for building, discussions on top of, on top of the opportunities. The world wants a forward-movement and when there is potential and growth, there is stickyness for the forwardness, to comply with. A whole industry. 

All these are networks, thus the platform potential lies ni deed in the network. When locomotives came along in the US, as Maury Klein has documented, it was scary to see the potential (of the network). We can celebrate that by the examination of the post written by a school in the north of US: 

> *""* Maury Klein, Power Makers 

But once a network becomes an ecosystem, then it boosts people to run interactions that are supportive of an economy, doesn't it? Consider any network, such as Craigslist, or even Facebook. 

We know, from theory of innocation, that breaking rules seem to be part of the equation in the sense of seeking freedom. As an example, consider the network of "yellow cabs" and the situation that gave rise to Uber. Not easy, to break the membrane of a network, it's like a social gut system perhaps, like a living ecosystem of bacteria and all sorts of things happening. Quite stable, a sort of colony, that we get used to. But then some people might get mad about its rules, others want to be somebody, or stumble in new ideas out of the interactions, needs.

We if look at the situation with Uber' story, I was a driver for 1000 trips. Perhaps as I was a part-time driver, not being 100% inside at it, I could bend its reality, a little and in my own way, very softly. I started doing on Fridays, and first my goal was to understand the rules "of the game" how the network works, thus I could exercise the idea of being somebody there, as a driver. I had to fight my fears, to put my mother's car in the streets, and my own fears such as driving into difficult streets, not being a good driver, and a lot more. When I came back that first day, I vividly remember, I sat on the couch but on it's arm with my feet on the couch, happy, telling my parents. Later happy for being a 5-star driver, or 4.9 one. Thus a lot of elements where in there, creating a platform for myself, to be someone, to make money too, where I could use some skills, could go towards been better as a driver, as a person, and get grades, and model my profile. End up with 1000 trips, good memories, and great stories too. 

One of the them was when I took a pregnant woman - she said it was close, last that was false alarm, when she was with her sister. This time, again, she was alone. I asked her - should I pass the red lights? She said no, please don't. Later I told her that we were next to the hospital X, Beneficiência Portuguesa, and she got scared and screamed "No, wrong hospital" to which I figured I confused the name and told here we were are going to the correct destination, and then she arrived safely. 

So I was there, also helping people, therefore not likely in a condition of urgency that would set me to perform in certain metrics, such as performance for money, which gave me experiences, to first see things that could be improved on top of the platform. That reflection was likely related to checking the limits of the bundled reality, like semi-unbundling, the sort of activities that users do, such as lead users [^footnote_lead_users] for when they are in it not trying to unbundle all but intended to support what is bundled, to evolve it. That sort of exposue can take some users to be considered as special, since they co-create the future of platforms, or can even give people jobs too. 

[^footnote_lead_users]: 

The situation I reflected was of the problems of the first trip, which involved the recognition of the fears that I went through, so I have envisioned that Uber could do a lot better to help one driver to reduce its fears. After the feelings of fears, the struggles, I caught myself later receiving an idea from a friend that became a driver. Since he knew that I was an entrepreneur, he called me asking me to make a simulation app for a first Uber trip — one that could create a fictitious trip in the streets. As I reflected about the aspects that apps could teach us in simulated environment [^footnote_uber_first_trip], it was interesting to the recognition of the problem by Ed Baker, a former Head of Product and VP of Growth at Uber: 

[^footnote_uber_first_trip]: https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc 

> *“For me, it was eye-opening when I did my first trip as a driver. I walked out to my car, I have done everything, I was activated. I walked out to my car [and] I walked back to my house because I got so nervous about doing that first trip.”*

Another sort of opportunity I crossed, although it seemed a bit outside the boundaries of Uber, was what I have named "Uber-idle university" [^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university] which explored an opportunity for learning as I have replaced the arbitrary with talks, Youtube lectures saved as mp3. To make the experience good, I also had to workout certain roadblocks, such as to curate a list of 3-5 talks before the day trips, and to come up with a saying for the passengers, giving them the option to talk with me or let me study what I called "Entrepreneurship lessons in English". Most passengers supported and even encouraged me. 

[^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university]: Marcio S Galli's article "Uber-idle University," published in Ascent Publication on December 2, 2017, delves into the concept of turning idle time into educational opportunities, particularly while performing tasks that don't require full cognitive engagement, such as driving for Uber. Galli, an entrepreneur who drives part-time for Uber, argues that much of the time spent in the car can be repurposed for learning by listening to talks, podcasts, or lectures on a pen drive. He distinguishes between "distractions" and "pauses," suggesting that Uber-related interruptions merely pause his educational experience rather than derail it. The article also highlights how the nature of listening fosters deeper engagement with the content, facilitating opportunities for reflection and understanding. Galli concludes by noting that this practice has led him to be more involved in helping startups, including his own. This article reflects a broader interest in finding innovative ways to incorporate learning into daily routines, a concept that has been especially relevant in the gig economy where traditional work hours are often disrupted. https://medium.com/the-ascent/uber-idle-university-5af317b550d9

Now, as we go back to the space for innovation, it seems that the celebration of the platform, when a network in a state of virtuous growth, which seems to go along with aspects indivated in the approach for scaling of Blitzscaling. From the standpoint of growth, and the view from inverstors interested in scaling platform networks, the analysis is for what elements neeed to be in the place, what forces are fovaourable or against, considering the expectations and vision of the network reaching its full potential. In the story of Uber, a prior network was know as the "yellow cabs" situation. Sequoia partners doing analysis, wanted to invest but to recognize the risks and take a strategy of focusing first in black cars. Sequoia has identified players that were in the field of unbundling the cabs networks, and one of them had the opportunity, although Sequoia wanted them to go back to black, stay away from yellow cabs at that moment. The CEO didn't accept. Later Sequoia end up finding an entrepreneur from San Francisco that were focusing in the black cards and asked if he would be okay with the moving on top of yellow cabs in the right time. And that became Uber. 

Another story, that shows how risks are taken in consideration when the matter are networks, is shown in the story of Linkedin [^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen] where the founders have documented aspects of the struggle to understand when and how to monetize the network. They indicate that some other social networks here real competitors but some of them wanted to make revenue ahead of time, while LinkedIn had a strategy to cover at least USA as a metric for its success with its main customer, corporations looking to hire people. 

[^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen]: 

These situations show intended efforts that seeks a readiness level for the network to be bundled. This is like showing that the curation of the platform, analysis for its future potential, is a must. VC partners of great VC organizations, such as Sequoia, Greylock and A16Z, are examples that show an intended analysis of how networks operate and the risks of scaling. In a way, the body of knowledge from these groups are able to bend reality, from a view from outside. 

But now, back to individuals anr the struggles of entrepreneurs, all of that tell us that stability in the platform produces ooportunities. Or a great platform with network potential involves offering opportunities in a stable matter, the ground for an economic model or interaction that produces value. Which comes after that the aspects which I refered as the prison. 

A complication is that we can be somebody in many of these platform systems, but the experience of being somebody, especially when we are driven by certain metrics, such as performance in attributes such as score, or grades, or money, can also prevent us from seeing opportunities, expect the condition of the exercise of the attempt to maximize effienncy in the network boils back to the situation of feedback that enriches the network. But the point I want to focus now is when being busy can also come with estability of the individual in the network. 

An additional complication is when we are trapped ny many layers. Like consider a phase of a computer game, a game that is more like an experience available in a world that supports games, a network platform for games, and that the game was written on top of an operating system that runs on top of a computer system. 

If the producer of the game experience decides to shut down its servers, impact is first perceived by the network of users experiencing that experience. For them, out of the sudden, the network seems to be down, but they might figure later that the developer-owner gave up. For some, sadness might take place as part of who they are were being exercised in the game environment, through an user profile. 

But when just playing the game, before the incident, it would indeed be quite difficult for one to bend the reality expect if by any chance you had another agenda that could give you the means to see reality from different viewpoint. We should note that while estabily in the platform exists, which pushes me to keep referring it as a prison, the opportunity for freedom is exercised by the users themselves, as each one might live an agenda and their needs can also take them to become creative, from sending suggestions to more deeper reflective experiences. Author Eric von Hippel, in Democratizing Innovation [^foonote_eric_von_hippel_democratizing_innovation], offers a great perspective about how users might become co-creators with producers. 

[^foonote_eric_von_hippel_democratizing_innovation]: 

Now, there are then the improvements within the realm, the hackers, and the ones that might reconsider the whole experience. Thus, we can assert about layers within the platform, and as humans as humans, they could be exposed to deeper reflections about the realities of all these layers that they be me acting in, or even the actual reflections for the ultimate layers which we decided to anchor ourselves in - such as the case of Albert Einstein.

In the realm of innovative products or services, for example, the notion of category design, as indicated by Play Bigger author Christopher Lochhead [^footnote_play_bigger], exposes elements involved for then new categories of products and services are evident.

[^footnote_play_bigger]: 

## Seeking truths 

Now, in the heated/cold space of one that lives the experience, it comes the considerations of experiencing that put us to reflect, go seek for truths, challenge the boundaries. When I had reflected about that my first trip as an Uber driver, I took me into writing an article because I considered that the platform could do something about something I saw, a need. Since I had an agenda for reusing the car radio to support my goal of watching talks, I had the opportunity to visualize that Uber-idle University idea. 

Some of these extended experiences can be suggested by platforms too. Consider a Yoga program that guides its participants into the levels of reflections, adding value to the experience. Another example, which I learned from my partner, was a situation of a dance program referred as bio dance, where she has acknowledged that she has reached a level of reflective state about her experience, brought up meaning, as in philosophical reflections which were relevant to others as their dance experience involved a guided experienced with well designed exercises to put the participants in the right spot to reflect. Another example might happen in the situation of reading Harry Potter, as indicated by Kasper ter Kuile the author of The Power of Rituals. Kasper has indicated that the experience from reading Harry Potter has components that brings up a connection with the self, with truths, and life situations, such as to a point of people organize themselves to reflect and discuss about what they experience as they read. The point here to make is that certain experiences might more or less push us towards the reflective interactions about our direct needs vs. internal needs and reflectinve interactions might enable us to explore the limits of the experience too. 

Robert McKee talks about truth and the necessity, for a storyteller, to bring out truth through stories. This same idea might be applicable to entrepreneurship because there is that idea that good ideas and solutions are liberating, that unbundle reality as we know it, and bundles a new reality.

To illustrate the situation, consider the case of a school, referred by Maury Klein in Power Makers, that wrote a post indicating that if God wanted locomotives he would have made humans with locomotive faces. Which shows that whoever wanted to be against locomotives had their own believes about an underlying truth. Conversely, the promoters of locomotives had their own reasons, and values, to promote that as the future. 

Another, anedoctal situation, more of the life in the kitchen, would be the situation that Marcio has identified of the advertisements of one popular convection oven. They would promote as able to fry things with no oil, which seemed great. But also another truth in it is that it would be the best when "frying" oily things



Now, these considerations for entrepreneurs for minimally consider the reflections on living their identities as somebody, on a platform, for leaving too, for reflecting outside. These exercises of writing, enable us to break the flow, sort of to get out from the autopilot was of flowing, acting. Julia Cameron uses methods of writing, with her prompts through articles, as a means for guiding potential writers outside the zone of writers block.
