## Slowing down is focusing

What we're not talking about
Talking about "less is more" means that we are not talking about:

We are not talking about working less
We're not even talking about more
So, we are talking about working better.
Who are we talking to? To the entrepreneur or one who is interested in productivity and management
Less is more is focus, for the entrepreneur we are talking about:
And management
It's productivity
It's organization
It's design in the sense of planning
Eliminate excesses, wear and tear, find freedom (help from Tim Ferris)
Inspired by Tim Ferris the Author of Work 4 Hours a Week - I like to start with this basic hygiene with ideas from Tim Ferris because the title of this work is confusing.
 It seems that it's not about dedication,
 it seems that it is related to lack of dreams,
or lack of willpower.

What Tim presents, in fact, are issues of productivity and strategy so that you can start working towards your dreams. What he asks those who want to achieve and work on their dreams:


May you cut work - For example work that doesn't work for you. For this you have to do the exercise, which involves work, to map what, from your activities, leads to something good for you, even if it is strategic (and it often is).


Don't look for work for work - from the actions initiated by you - the last thing you want is to find work for work. What he asks for with this is again that his actions are somehow justified, that they can collaborate with his goals.


Monitor disruption - your standard behavior of habits - and analyze how it contributes to your progress - given life interruptions, which are now many, we easily engage in issues and interaction, or distraction. These behaviors become villains on our agenda. The first thing we have to understand is that we are also responsible for the disruption caused by systems or humans, the outside world. An example is the situation where someone contacts you, perhaps asking for help but you have a standard response type. For example, you automatically try to find out more about the person's life "and how are things?" Tim asks you to better identify the interaction that starts - you see, for yourself - because it is you who define what the next steps of any interruption are like. You see, you can be just someone nice or someone who likes to help the world. So that would naturally make you a point of contact commonly used by others. But it is you who are responsible, at the end of the day and you who loose more or less line. So monitor, set a quality standard. In this monitoring, it is worth remembering Andy Grove, Intel's late CEO and master of management who taught Silicon Valley a lot. You can measure your behaviors by sampling. You do not need to make a spreadsheet with everything you do and constantly monitor the "beat" of your activities. What you can do is take a week, for example, and do accurate monitoring work, and establish a qualitative analysis. With your analysis to be done with reflection, for example you can write, you will start to learn the lessons learned. From these lessons you can choose new behaviors.
Now let's go back to Focus
With the help of John Doerr, investor, mentor and author of the book Measure What Matters (which promotes the idea of ​​OKR as the productivity management scheme, the same used at Google, the scheme that was born at Intel with Andy Grove but has origins in Peter Drucker).

John reminds us that your goals must be significant.


John also brings the vision of Larry Page, co-founder of Google, who likes to put more wood on fewer arrows. An example of this on the google scale - and just look at Google for being big could easily just lose focus - can be illustrated in the episode when YouTube’s leadership announced that it would be better for YouTube to have an improved login experience (they knew that with the login the user could, for example, like the videos, mark to see later, like ringing the bell, etc.) and integrated with the Google login. The objective, significant for YouTube, was communicated by the YouTube leadership, the priority for a better login experience. But when it came to Google's leadership, what happened was general support. That goal, which was number one for YouTube, became a high priority goal for Google as a whole. The project came out in half the time.

For Andy Grove, the reference that inspired John Doer to write the book Measure What Matters, about OKR, "the art of management depends on the ability to select, from the many possible activities of comparable significance, those for example one or two or three that become levers.
To close this video - less is more
I hope these visions can inspire you
On the importance of

Perceive / measure - first
Analyze / reflect - second
Plan your vision
Identify actions that leverage

And it is worth remembering - whether successful or unsuccessful, everything is learning. That is precisely why you can obtain it by having a certain rigor in your learning process. With this certain rigor, with focus, you are more likely to work for your dreams and not work for work.
