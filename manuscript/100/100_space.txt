Uber-idle University
Case of listening to a VC-team, YouTube-podcast audio when I am Uber-driving

My idea entitled “Uber-idle University” is nothing new: It’s having a pen drive ready with nice talks, in a given subject field. It simply helps me to reuse the idle time with learning.

I had to put this in place because I am an entrepreneur and wanted to compensate the “robotic” condition that I became when I turned into a part-time Uber driver.

Yes, I am a part-time Uber driver, about 1/5 of the week, and during that time I have lots of time in idle mode: Some people just don’t talk and of course Uber driving requires a number of waiting times.

Going straight to the example case, here is my last collection that is going into the pen-drive session #30:

Uber-idle-university session 30, a collection of 5 talks from Greylock partners (5–10 hours active in Uber)

So far some observations:
No distractions
While listening sessions can break — such as the condition when there is a call, or a customer inside the car; yet this is more like a pause. It’s not a distraction that calls my mind into another focus area. As quick as I solved the valid “Uber” interruption, I am back on track.

Listening is harder — and incredibly powerful
The above case collection will probably ride with me for 3 rounds x 3–4 hours, at least. So indeed it takes more time comparing with watching the YouTube video on the computer.

But I do not see this as a problem and in fact I see as an opportunity. What is happening is that I am re-watching (re-listening) again and again. I also send lots of e-mail notes or messages to myself.

The phenomenon of play-pause is also very common. It turns out I have to reflect a lot. This have helped me to understand more about my learning style because play-pause was something I was not doing when watching through the plain Youtube experience.

Back into the other parts of life
The result? It turns out I found myself helping startups more and more. One of these start-ups is my own. But such effect really came out of the whole project, not out of isolated sessions. To give you an overview of the past sessions see the following dump.
