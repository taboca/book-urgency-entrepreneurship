Este artigo discute a complexidade da busca por impacto nas iniciativas empreendedoras, destacando a lacuna entre o desejo de criar impacto e a realidade desafiadora que tal empreitada envolve. Inicialmente, examina-se o impulso empreendedor e como nossa determinação de trabalhar - ou performar - pode paradoxalmente levar a consequências de impacto negativo que arrasta o empreendimento e distrai os que executam. O artigo propõe que o que nos leva ao sucesso inicial não é necessariamente o que nos sustentará a longo prazo, enfatizando a dificuldade em conectar os pontos e a necessidade de reflexão entre o fazer e o transcender, o que requer adaptação.

Na primeira parte da reflexão traz a preocupação com o movimento incial empreendedor que impulsionado por uma visão pode gerar impacto negativo. Neste sentido, destacam-se "armadilhas" que surgem a partir da ilusão de performance, como a partir da productização ou do exercício da identidade especialista. Alguns casos são ilustrados como o trabalhador de alta performance e ético, o trabalhador romântico e o trabalhador guardião. A segunda parte da reflexão trata da busca por sair do fluxo de performance do trabalho para escutar e adaptar-se - transcender. O artigo conclui refletindo sobre a natureza dinâmica do crescimento e a importância de acessar valores que podem ajudar a guiar ações e decisões em um cenário que demanda constante adaptação e execução consciente.

## SCqA 

* Irony - When we search for impact, we impact the possibility of searches. 
* Subject - For all actions we decide, there is a price to pay. Let's keep the reflective mode on, think through the goals, access values.   

* Situation - We want to be helpful, to feel that we are somebody, we might go for effort, amazing. Even if we think "strategically," we might fall into not able to see all. 

* Complication - When an effort sets a complication ahead, we might seek other duties, duties that could be simpler for us, or fun, or exciting, highly performatic or where we don't have to fail as a result of judgement. 

* Q/A - 

* Answer - Key 1 - How we do it and works - no controler acts for effective for goals. The sky is the limit for a mind that wants to do what they think it is the homework - naturally comes with not doing some other homework that could support the vision for what is ahead. Some escaping is natural, and likely good, as in creating creative solutions for what is hard. Hyper performance comes out of support, it is not bad and it is how we measure, perhaps what we envision as a scaling strategy. But in exploring the danger of blind or arbitrary, comes the importance of recognotion of the objectives as unclear is a door into the openning for strategic higher-order thinking. Present the case of Harriet given by the view of Michael Dearing, present ideas from Robert McKee about the desirable object. Present the need for refactoring that is iminent anyway, thus the desirable object was likely wrong. 

Notice the nature of release of control, such as a work towards aspiring goals. We now it works and may explain that we can and should do that. But by noticing the value, we also can notice the risks, that we will dead certain to get results. But also results in arbitrary might not reflect in goal-driven when to be goal-driven is a must. Plus, it may create other distractions too, after excitement. Plus, success in terms of goal achievement and growth is not garanteed through the arbitrary. 

* Answer - key 2 - Management of goals and bottoms up and goal discovery. Present the idea that putting to out pulls for clarity. Conver strategic key results that adds space for what is needed in terms of development, such as the case that Michael has referred of an employee that was highly technical and had created a key result to participate in business meetings. Cover the recognition of certain "blocked areas" which would influence transcending the role - We might be judging ourselves as not apt to managerial, not skilled, not enabling room within the project for aspirational design, or setting a commitment for something that demands research or learning, and transcending the activity, minimally recognizing time. All sorts of difficult places can create a blocking condition. The design of any goal that is difficult needs to account the capacity for delivery plus allow room for learning, and not punish by results. The complication is that if we are running arbitrary and not getting comfortable with stating what is going to happen, and being okay with learning and failure.
