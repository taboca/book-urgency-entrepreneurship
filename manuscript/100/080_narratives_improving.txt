* Asbtract - In today's digital age, where narratives are skillfully woven to captivate and consume our attention, it is essential for entrepreneurs to reclaim autonomy over their time and decisions. We know that a good narrative is good, can engage us, to pay attention if not to act. But now the digital narratives happen to be everywhere as platforms have matured as generators of narratives. This has modernized in ways that can trap us to focusing on the narratives within platforms. We will see how we experience this and reflect about the dynamics with the intention of improving our awareness, and discernment, so that we can resist being pulled by the narrative potential of digital systems. The focus shifts towards fostering a balanced entrepreneurial life, where goals are not dictated by external narratives but driven by authentic aspirations and consciousness.

Like the book of amigos da mente points, that lacks of gut microbiota might be inducing your habit and style, and also what Johann writes in the page 23. This perhaps suggest to us that network of data, what is injest, might be confusing founders. This may also be a good case, check p 23, for the narrative dilemma.

In today's digital age, where narratives are skillfully woven to captivate our attention, it is essential for entrepreneurs to reclaim autonomy over their time and decisions. We know that a good narrative is good, can engage us, to pay attention if not to act. But now the digital narratives happen to be everywhere as platforms have matured as generators of narratives. This has modernized in ways that can trap us to focusing on the narratives within platforms. We will see how we experience this and reflect about the dynamics with the intention of improving our awareness, and discernment, so that we can resist being pulled by the narrative potential of digital systems. The focus shifts towards fostering a balanced entrepreneurial life, where goals are not dictated by external narratives but driven by authentic aspirations and consciousness. 

In the pre-digital era, life was simpler. Travel back to 1885 in the heart of the Old West. Picture a farm where the day begins with the first light of dawn and the crowing of a rooster. Coffee steams on a wood-burning stove, and as the curtains of night unveil a sunny stage, a calf takes its first steps. However, that day's joy was soon eclipsed for a blacksmith by an unsatisfied outlaw customer. He returned, quick to blame the blacksmith for his horse's fall, attributing it to the new horseshoes, even though he had been riding drunk. Life, ever the grand stage, presents its ebb and flow, the miracle of nature, and the unpredictable shades of human nature. Both the uplifting and challenging moments sets us to be protagonists in front of the job to be done, as we fight for what matters.

Contrast this life with the life of Jeniffer, back to the future. In the setting of 2025, the alertness of her day starts with a "rooster's crow" although coming from her "smart watch", which repeats multiple times a day according to various simultaneous schedules. The unveiling of her day runs of incessant events that welcomes her listen and act in ways of the digital that have no boundaries. 

Jane had always been dreaming of living healthier lifestyle, although it was always difficult to get on track. Her journey began when she stumbled upon "Her-o-matic," a trending digital platform promoted as "a seamslessly experience for your health development plans, fun. " So then Jane has entered into the user experience which was indeed seamless, as she answered a prompt of questions about her diet, exercise habits, and goals. It turned out that the application instantly produced a tailored plan of daily workouts, meal suggestions, and mindfulness exercises. But nothing like a complex 2 year plan. Something fun and engaging, suitable for starting today. In other words, the system has onboarded her in a friendly way, using a digital character, coach Rooster. As weeks turned into months, Jane noticed the app's knack for introducing new product suggestions â€” everything from protein powders to advanced workout gear. But these didn't seem like arbitrary products - no. Coach Rooster has listened to her goals and all the integrated products seemed to really work in favor of her goals, her health plan. Some of these purchases served for unlocking new statuses, creating a sense of achievement. In other words, it seemed that coach Rooster became smarter, not only to keep track of her goals but to remind her of her achievements, and to engage her into purchasing products that would count in favor of her goal profile. The app introduced a social board where users started to share their achievements and top performers using sponsored products where about to get extra points that would be turned as prizes such as cupons. What Jane really loved from Her-o-matic is what they call "the leaderboard room," a place where she can see her rank position against others. According to coach Rooster, members are not competitors, even if they are better than you for a given week, you can still follow their steps, such as to see which practices they did, such as to buy the same products they use - actions that works to support your ranking status, so you can beat them, or better, teach them. According to coach Rooster, the experience is more like a sports team, as opposed to a war fight. One evening though, Jane had the opportunity for a pause, after securing the top spot for the 3rd week in a row. She was also feeling a bit overwhelmed about the checks every day and recharging her mobile phone, although coach rooster would never appear tired, never older, never stressed. 

Was she truly leading a healthier lifestyle? Or had she been caught up in the whirlwind of purchasing products? As shown, a key element in this created story is less about how much value is offered value and more to give a perspective that narratives can be created into systems. Modern digital systems have reached a maturity level where their narratives is really orchestrated by the protagonists, the users, which puts elements (such as coach Rooster) as coadjuvants. For the narrative to take place, the relationship has to be symbiotic - needs a mutual beneficial relationship between the different species - humans and systems, such as coach Rooster. But notice that the narrative becomes real only after the the fact that the user is in. Thus, what the system does is to recognize the nature of the job that the user is into (in the case of Jane the job of being healthier) and provides a guided narrative that helps her to close the gap. The elements presented by the system are not unlike the elements that one would live if she had a real coach.   

But not unlike life, the storied context in the narratives of real time can be also overwhelming, or can trick us. When we reflect about the potential of a narrative that is being done with an application, my hope is that we lift our awareness that the world of today has a lot more doors for all the sorts of interactions. And that all of these systems (more or less symbiotic) are getting greater and greater in creating narrative spaces for their users.
