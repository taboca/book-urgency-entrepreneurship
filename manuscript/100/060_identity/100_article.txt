* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Identity - Consider to bring the quote from Amartya Sen from Identity and Violence, ref "The following is a quote from Amartya Sen from the book Identity and Violence, found in the preface, in the beginning of the preface. Oscar Wilde made the enigmatic claim, most people are other people. This may sound like one of his more outrageous conundrums, but in this case Wilde defended his view with considerable consciency. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation. We are indeed influenced to an amazing extent by people with whom we identify."

* Outlinne - Pitch - To be concerned with the identity, not objective, they think. But an identity is formed from a role, and can offer risk the very moment when they become. 
--> 





Why bother with the identity of the being that carries out the work of entrepreneurship? It might be considered a waste of time.  Maybe I we could even say that, in general, entrepreneurs identify themselves as people who care more about their objectives than about who they are - their identities. But then and when things do well and when they get to be seen as successful entrepreneurs - and while they have ignored these reflections during the bulk what they did - they are then caught being interviewed about themselves and somehow they get to speak then. People are then interested to know more, their characteristics or something about their personalities or what explains how they made it or what they are made of. This is likely too the situation when they better identify themselves as entrepreneurs, although after the fact and in hindsight. 

And in alignment with our concerns in this book, we shall set ourselves to look at their identity; to be concerned with the possibility that the execution brings them to become mature, to embrace perspectives, so that they become. But along with that they can too become a problem in the growth path of their startups.

No artists start with the fully knowing that they are artists. Like entrepreneurs or writers, although they seem to recognize a half door open to them, unclear to tell in the beginning tough. Brian Chesky of Airbnb [^footnote_brianchesky] acknowledged that - in hindsight - the only entrepreneur he knew was Bob from Bob's pizza [^footnote_brianchesky_bob]. But like artists, entrepreneurs seem to identify themselves as sort of doers and learners that takes them into it, into becoming. Some of that goes well with the insight from Steve Blank, given in the prior chapter, as he considered that entrepreneurs didn't born as entrepreneuers, and that entrepreneurship can be taught for the ones that passionately want to become one, in the first place, but that are ones that see themselves as protagonists, that besides the willingness to learn are into doing it, executing it. 

[^footnote_brianchesky]: Co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, Brian Chesky has become a leading figure in the tech industry, particularly within the sharing economy. Under his leadership, Airbnb has transformed from a simple idea of renting out air mattresses in a living room to a global platform offering unique accommodations and experiences. 

[^footnote_brianchesky_bob]: In his talk on Blitzscaling, Brian Chesky mentioned Bob from Bob's Pizza as an example of an entrepreneur. https://youtu.be/W608u6sBFpo?si=MHVkBijl9I5DpAfC&t=99

In other words, while in the beginning they generally can't tell who they are - if generally are not interested to discusss - they seem to recognize or identify themselves with personalities or the characterizations of entrepreneurs, after the fact. But if it seems to be like a revelation, certainly given in retrospect, it is certain one spoken of as not one made of an arbitrary movement. In other words, while they claim they couldn't connect the dots, they do recognize their passions, or motivations, or that actual movements they trusted had to do with leading them into it - into becoming - as eloquently put by Steve Jobs in his speech at Stanford: 

> *"Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later."* (Jobs, Steve, 2005)

* Complication - #Identity #Change #lock - The journey, from chaos to clarity, demands change for success. But also that change define us, and can impact too in the challenging path.  
--> 








Now, from that journey, and by assuming a certain stage of achievement, it may help us to understand other implications of themselves discovering themselves as entrepreneurs. As noted, they might have changed and transcended or learned - from the experiences and even from failures - and by now they have a more clear relationship with their craft. For some of them, it could be that they think that what they do is really their destiny. Or even if we can't go that far, they may still think that they have discovered, in a way or another, theirselves as protagonists of the entrepreneurial craft on their hands, or as a kind of personality responsible for for what is now happening, or what it is now working, or for keeping up with the dots now connected. 

And while they are not yet concerned with themselves as entrepreneurs - likely because they didn't yet hit a major mark as succerssful or failure to a point of being interviwed about who they are such as their personalities - this is a point when they more intensively, or more consciously, respond to what is ahead by being who they now are. And since a lot of the good benefits of that awareness is taken care or spoken elloquently by too many stories of success, we shall set ourselves to look at the possibility of an identity that responds too in negative ways. In other words, when an identity embraced and formed by its own merits, becomes a potential source of complications that sets challenges.

--> 







Let us be concerned with the realization that we embrace a quite beautiful being that can do magic but how that consciousness and trust becomes the very element that prevents one to into transcending it, to change ourselves, such as to creatively destroy ourselves. With the sections below, we will start our reflection by looking at the journey of the self that is starts the movement with passion and motivations. 

Looking from the holistic view of growth - which indeed starts with the sparks from a particular vision, or from strong values, or even passion from performing, or great ambitions - we will reflect about how their initial system of passions and motivations, and aspirations and valuess, are key drivers taking them into becoming or embracing styles and how that can be challenging. Then we focus within their bubbles, so that we can witness themselves caught in what they think is a path of growth, and in what gives them the status of protagonists, to reflect on the struggle through the interactions and feelings that happens in realtime as they climb through a ladder of affairs and associations with the environment that feeds them for good or bad. Then we come back to the reflection outside their bubbles, to consider how we can break it and challenge the perceptions about our roles; where a better destiny is to embrace ourselves as the whole that lives multiple identities.














## Shapen by a vision

<!--
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Pitch - A vision for who we are doing it? It can't be normal vision [feat. AG] 
--> 






Let us assume that entrepreneurs, like artists, are following a vision. But I don't mean that kind of vision where one would be a followed of something envisioned as if they could commit to implementing the dots - as if they could get the dots that comes after the fact. I thankful for the analogies with artists because it helped me to shift away from that notion - as that is certainly not what artists do - is an idea I better consolidated when I read from Adam Grant, in Originals that Da Vinci had done about 1200 drawings, to name an example. 

Leaving the romantic idea of a vision such as one that requires a static objective ahead - certainly one that would be better followed by the limelights - we shall turn to vision for how we see ourselve                               s as protagonists. That is more realistic plus quite applicable to explain the various situations when the entrepreneur enters the journey and leaves 80% of what they thought behind and by doing that they actually get to be successful and achieve clarity and encounter or transcend into something new. This goes well with the journey where they find purpose, where the journey too takes them to get the mission right. This other vision also goes better with the words from Andy Grove:

* Outline - Situation - Calling [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 




This idea that recognizes the role of the entrepreneur in the process is also supported by Steve Blank  [^steveblanklean], a renowed investor, professor of innovation and entrepreneurship, and practitioner in the field of startups and especially known for having originated the Lean Startup Movement. But more important, Steve Blank as an entrepreneur was alive too when he was asked to give a single piece of advice for founders: he recalled his days and reported not believing that he were working in Silicon Valley and being paid to do what he would do for free (Blank, 2014); and that he would even pay to have the opportunity. If that notion seems a bit far from our sight, the essence of it does justice to the situation that many of them do enter entrepreneurship not being paid and into a path of uncertainties and of too many odds against. We recognize that they are driven by passions and motivations and aspirations and and other things that keeps their tank full: 

[^steveblanklean]: Steve Blank is a renowned entrepreneur and academic recognized for being one of the pioneers of the Lean Startup movement. Blank, along with Eric Ries, helped define and propagate the Lean Startup philosophy, which proposes the creation of companies and products under conditions of extreme uncertainty. His work, characterized by "customer development" and the idea of "get out of the building," is a fundamental pillar of this methodology. Blank emphasizes the importance of validated learning, iterative product development, and rapid response to customer needs as key principles for innovation in startups.

> *"Founders is not a job, is a calling... This is not some job. The odds of you making money... versus working at McDonalds, it’s a much better bet that you will be making more money in your career working at McDonalds. You need to do what you are doing because you love it, because you can’t think of anything better to do with your life. And if that is not the case, don’t do this because it’s going to be a miserable 10 or 20 years. If you are looking at getting rich like the Facebook boys, or the Google boys, or whatever the hot startup is now, that is the wrong reason to do it. If you are chasing the money, I will guarantee you, the more you chase it, the further away is goes."* (Blank, 2014, 34:33)

* Outline - Situation - Andy grove points about the work situation, and things like money, or comparison, as a builder of self development in terms of Maslow motivational pyramid. 
--> 





I especially enjoy the viewpoint of *The Calling* not only because it sets the entrepreneur at the center of what happens but also invites us to reflection about how money matters and how it matters exactly money money is not the outcome. In other words, the element of money too a central element in their journeys. It might even be risky to consider an extremme when money is not the outcome but how it is essentially part of the calling as a relative measure of success. As an example, consider the point of view from Andy Grove from High Output Management about how the salary is perceived in a corporate setting: 

> *"Money has significance at all levels of Maslow's motivation hierarchy. As noted earlier, a person needs money to buy food, housing, and insurance policies, which are part of his physiological and safety/security needs. As one moves up the need hierarchy, money begins to mean something else - a measure of one's worth in a competitive environment. Earlier I have described a simple test that can be applied to determine the role money plays for someone. If the *absolute* amount of raise in salary is important, that person is probably motivated by physiological or safety security needs. If the *relative* amount of a raise - what he got compared to others - is the important issue, that person is likely to be motivated by self-actualization, because money here is a measure, not a necessity."* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 213)

* Outline - Situation - Establishing the idea that the work good conditions shapes a professional identity which may characterize the human identity in ways
--> 






In the entrepreneurship situation, money gets to be seen in so many special ways and conversely money can affect the path of what happens in so many ways. In other words, modern entrepreneurs young or experienced will listen to money as they recognize its value as major in different ways in the entrepreneurial function, such as as the thing that adds fire to work such as as the thing that signals if something is working. In the view from Michael Dearing, an idea that have unleashed entrepreneurship especially during the industrial revolution, involved the disconnection between the people with money and the ideas people and management.  Michael had illustrated this potential by looking back to the early forms of investing long before the rise of venture capital - pointing how the Brown Family (the money people) became investors in the Slater's Mill (the idea people) around end of 1700 and early 1800: 

> *"The people who put up the capital for Slater's Mill were the Brown family of Providence, the people after whom Brown University was named. This was a family that made their fortune in the slave trade and then the textile business. And then had no clue how to mechanize their spinning operations. Slater was the embodiment of somebody who had the technical skill and inventiveness, ideas mostly which he stole from the UK, and they were able to pair together in a way that wouldn't have been possible previously."* (Dearing, Michael, 2015)

In other words, no strict vision for something ahead exist and no strict outcome exists asking just for money; but then we set ourselves to respect how the individual that is part of the entrepreneurial activity is central. The role or the being or an entrepreneur that possesses a mix of elements that pulls them into the calling. If this is a vision, it is one where they see themselves as managers and as conductors and as the ones responsible for orchestrating what it takes, to set the dishes spinning, and to coordinate a lof so that the oppoortunity for growth happens - like to orchestrate the elements of managemenent with the elements of money ( from customers or investors ) with the ideas. 

This too is a vision that can invite us to look at a potential growth that happens with us - good or bad growth - or to consider what we become, and if we actually become as part of the journey. As noted, we came as ones not being able to connect the dots, first. Then, to being the ones that can tell where we are or even who we are and to claim that we see the roads ahead or even to claim that where are going we don't need roads. If we consider that this calling is a pathway tht set us into becoming it, into turning out to become entrepreneurs, we might open ourselves to the characterizations that we get along the way which certainly give us good things and along with that it may too characterizes ourselves to the points that an audience in the future may look at us and look for a personality or an identity. In other words, we are now turning our attention to ourselves that gets to become responsible as we act, the ones that respond to what is expected, the ones that embraces certain models of thinking, or of organization. Consider, for example, how a founder may embrace respect for investors if they get involved in understanding the role of investors and gets too investment. Or consider the respect that can grow from the presence of a potential customer. In other words, I am inviting you to consider a potential where the entrepreneurial situation can shape our perspectives too, which may go along with an observation from Abraham Maslow - although one which he observed from the work space when he was invited to to reflect about the corporate space of Non-linear Systems in California around 1960 - when he said that "These highly evolved individuals assimilate their work into their identity into their self, i.e., work actually becomes part of the self part of the individual's definition of himself." (1998. p.1)

--> 



Now, granted, the view in the reflection from Maslow is not in any way a provocation for us to consider the whole individual as defined by what they do in work or even in the entrepreneurial situation. Naturally, these situations aren't the whole, aren't the stage of our lives where most of what we do happens in terms of social interactions. But the provocation serves to provoke us to consider that if the average work can be impactful to the self, then it may be so if not even more that the doing of one living the entrepreneurial calling would too be impactful, even to a further extent as the calling is not a normal job. 

In other words, the entrepreneurial path may become a place where these doers are climbling in a ladder of needs [^footnote_maslow_needs_hierarchy]. For one to be in the calling they might be into a situation of feeling their phisiological needs satisfied - for example it may be so that they feel health and energized and in good conditions for it. Furthermore, they might too be feeling safe, even if so for a while, as they might be in it being sponsored or incubated or under investing or some situation or narrative where feel safe to continue for a period of time. They might too be feeling confident and psychologically safe, either due to their aspirations or dreams or the said conditions or other support they got. This is then a good place where many would good to be creative such as that they aren't pressured to be who they aren't. It may too be that the environment of colleagueship exists, given their mission and objectives exist. In other words, entrepreneurs living the calling can find themselves under that vision. It comes too from that thay they might be operating in ways where they would be apt to be learning, or to be failing. Thus it is natural from us to expect that their development may happen too in harmonious ways, which is to say that a self development is promoted by the healthy "work" environment; at least that it is much better than a work situation that is unhealthy or where many of the needs said aren't in place.

[^footnote_maslow_needs_hierarchy]: The concept of human needs for motivation and development has been explored from both psychological and business perspectives. Abraham Maslow first introduced the hierarchy of needs in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" published in the Psychological Review, proposing a pyramid structure of human needs from physiological to self-actualization. Andy Grove, in his book "High Output Management," recognized the employees' basic needs as a foundation for higher productivity and self-actualization within the workplace.

* Complication - That the journey is not a journey of discovery of their performers, such as existing. It may be a journey of shaping, shaped by performing and influneced by dynamic passions and motivations. 
--> 





Now and normally, and given the heat of the execution that a startup demands, plus the fast-paced work mentality we live, we find no reason to rain and ruin on our own parade, to mess up with the very idea that gives us the strength to make everything such as the impossible possible. That is to say that normally our interest to the subject of regulation of our behaviors it's something to be a concern. In a way, we identify ourselves as a role that disregards this very consideration as futile or useless. That kind of position, or mentality, is too an embraced mentality that we may get from the way things are being done, maybe from the environment too. That is to say as an example that we get to connect the dots - as far as the calling goes - by turing ourselves as performers. And as for how we appear in more evident ways, it may be so that we feel that we are accessing or augumenting our powers or discovering our best selves while doing it. As executors driven by passions and motivations, we can't enter the reasoning and reflecting from the wider view about the possibilities that we are growing stronger and that with that we may also be maturing our views, or locking ourselves in perspectives. 

And of course none of this would be a problem but the growth situation of startups didn't require from its leaders to be open, to be learners, to be listeners, and too to be checking on their behaviors. So if and when the actual movement happens for growth, it is then when the calling set us to surrender our views and how we see thing but then too we find the confrontation with ourselves of who we became. Now, in other words, we are performer-entrepreneurs living a mix of behaviors and perspectives - one that certainly holds a set of values, one that stands up, that takes responsibilities, that feels responsible, that expect of themselves to be protagonists, that too have something to lose. Then it goes with that too that we can be trapped ourselvws into the same fast-paced culture of execution where most learnings happen in retrospect. And an example of a problem is the general culture of the doer that tries to identify their best strengths and only focus on best strengths, such as by doing psychological tests; therefore it is as if we are thinking of ourselves as a tool that can be acquired, to use it as it is. That mode of thinking could, perhaps, in a way or another work when things are matured and all is working and say a specialist is actually needed for something very specific. But Unfortunatelly that is not good enough to expect from leaders, from founders, from an entrepreneur.

By pausing and reflecting about these aspects, we can gain an improved awareness about the entrepreneurial journey as formed by the personalities and characters and identities of entrepreneurs. In the next sections, we're going to consider two viewpoints. The first from the entrepreneur side, considering that they can be in passion with these aspects that can set them to be too involved in the process or enamorated with the idea or focusing too much on the product side, the passions that can set them in a specific direction miss the whole growth curve. And then the other viewpoint from the vision of the investors or the gatekeepers of growth, which are equally concerned about the behaviors of founders and teams, their identities. And as much as they appreciate their passion, they know that can be a fuel to bring them harm, can prevent the whole business into the growth situation due to obsessions, such as that can cause destruction to the business and the growth situations, if not the well-being of entrepreneurs.

### Founder's passions 









By our involvement and being called to do a job that needs to be done, the job of growth, we essentially set ourselves in a context where productivity matters. And just any any other job that have steps [^footnote_jtbd_jobsteps], we may too feel good about the activities we do. A founder may love to be "determining their goals and plan resources," or they enjoy to "Gather items and information needed to do the job," or like to "Set up the environment to do the job," or appreciate to "Verify that they’re ready to perform the job," or smile that they can "Carry out the job,", or have fun when they "Assess whether the job is being successfully executed", or are proud to "Make alterations to improve execution," or they worship when they "Finish the job or prepare to repeat it."

[^footnote_jtbd_jobsteps]: The Job Map by Strategyn (2024) says that all kinds of jobs have 8 steps. From that fundamental thinking I got inspired to think about the job of making a startup, or the job of a team seeking to innovate by making a company.

In other words, and as said, we can't avoid becoming performers and we can't avoid enjoying our best moves. With that, it comes from our operating system that we can be evaluating ourselves even thought doing it in seamless ways and unfortunatelly not under formal circunstances, especially in the pressure to do things fast. But our thirst for performing take us to be automatically assessing ourselves as entrepreneurs, how we are doing it, surely not so directly checking on our attitudes or behaviours but essentially embracing habits from what seem to be things we do that works. This might be a birthplace of things that can become our superpowers, which happens to be seamlessly evident by the confirmations from the feedback that we get after the actions that we have executed. In other words, the environment claps or money appears or some press may too give them the startup massage to their startup's ego. And a lot more that essentially take us to be proud. This is the birthplace of some style or perspective or our ways to operate with mentals shortcuts which influences how we make decisions, naturally given that some positive results comes along. This may too be a sort of inconscious movement from what works but we may sense it as we may get to love ourselves as doers when we do it. Let us consider situations and reflect on how we can engage in being rewarding ourselves as we move through the ladder of the entrepreneurial journey.

* Outline - Harmonious or obsessive - Case of "How to break into Silicon Valley" [feat. Andrew Chen]
--> 

#### The knight founder







Consider the following, given by Andrew Chen from A16Z, for *How to Break into Silicon Valley*, where he had shared a perspective that can support entrepreneurs to achieve productive conversations as they network. The following is optimistic in nature which is self-evident; so rather ask you to read the excerpt by focusing on his level of awareness - of a writer and has achieved a higher degree of awareness about one's style -  that brought him to consider the characteristics and even to propose a dynamic in the face of entrepreneurial needs:  

> *That said, the conversations are more productive when you have “a thing.” What I mean by that is that all of these conversations and networking are more useful when you are starting a company, creating a new podcast, are working on a new project or book, or something else. When you have a directed goal in mind, then the conversations often are more valuable for all parties involved, because you were making yourself an expert in a particular area and your questions are more relevant. Otherwise you will surely encounter very busy people who simply refuse to “grab coffee” to “catch up” because it’s a poor use of time.*
> 
> *I encourage you to be on a quest of your own, and even better a particularly interesting quest, so that your conversations with people can be as productive as possible. In my case, I was very interested in the state of the art on growing users, metrics, network effects, and marketing. I asked everyone about this topic, and began to develop my own ideas that I would share freely. Eventually, it became clear that a few small communities orienting the PayPal mafia were the furthest along in their thinking. And that’s how I ended up being exposed first to concepts like retention curves, DAU/MAU, viral loops, and so on.* 
>  
> *These ideas were interest to me, because my professional experience leading up to that point was actually an adtech. I had previously worked in online ads, with customers from WSJ, CBS, MySpace, etc, and had even gotten a patent filed on ad targeting (yes, US7747676B1). I had a superpower in my domain knowledge of CAC, A/B testing, funnel optimization, lead gen, etc, and began to merge all of this thinking with consumer products. In 2007 this was cutting edge at a time when product success was often measured by vanity metrics such as the total registrations for a product. This bit of specialized knowledge was what I brought to the table, and I talked about some of those learnings and ideas, and how they might apply to products. Sometimes I’d get intros to interesting people simply because of this expertise, which I appreciated."*

This illustration, although not a story of an founder, evidently shows as entrepreneurial in nature; but too it is evident that we become concerned with the things we do as conductors. Consider how the conversation focueses in the role of a conductor that first values navigating through networks. Then consider how it values certain networks such as the ecosystem of the valley. Moreover, it focuses in the aspects of essentially ourselves testing outselves moving through the ladder. This might well be an example of a practical advice that because it may sound so coherent for a protagonist that is into the growth situation of a startup, it just appears as advice. So we read and one may say "Wait, I can do that too" or "Wait, I might have indeed something great to talk about," or "Wait, I was too obvious in my quest seeking for money and I forgot to focus on the values and nice things I am involved with," which could then too quick bring them to consider that "maybe I could jump into networking by having interesting conversations about the things I do that are really interesting." And then as he or she does it, and if works, they might finally move from a half door open to being in a room. 

The point being, if we can stop right now to rest and reflect, is that we become and we embrace before we know it; such as before we are aware that we are too navigating around and shopping for atitudes, shopping for behaviors, picking advice.

#### The aspiring founder 









When I joined an accelerator program in 2016 I had a badge labeled "empresário." That is the thing that a Brazilian would fill in a form to describe their title - as the responsible that runs a tax-paying business entity. In addition, I was also an entrepreneur. And secretly I saw myself as a sort of artist. And not secretly although trying to hide at that time I was a software developer. And out of curiosity I had other titles such as Web Master from back in the good old days when the movie Jurrassic Park came out. And now I just remembered that being a Web Master brought me to become a Web Developer  [^footnote_marciogalli_webdevelopers]. 

[^footnote_marciogalli_webdevelopers]: In *The History of Web Developers Tied to Browser Development* (2023), I had had the opportunity to reflect about the emergence of the role known as the "web developer." That the environment, the emergence of browsers, have helped to shape the role. It seems to be, as we see people working, that the craft shapes them, to a certain degree. This may be the be observable in some corporate situations, like the corporations from the west from the late 1900s to and early 2000s. And it is likely what makes the perception of performance - assuming that their colleagues understand them, that their colleagues trust them, that they predict what they do and how they do - as much it makes them to create impactful outcomes - good or bad.

--> 

But then, in that new domain of being accelerated (as they would say), a new title was coming my way quite fast. I noticed it the day they invited me to speak. Before the event they requested the "bio," which is basically a short story so that they can introduce the speaker. I gave them the bio thing but followed by my name, my current title, and the name of my company. But as the limelight turned on I was surprised to be introduced as "Marcio, an aspiring founder." I can't say I loved it because the first thing that went through my head was "Where is my bio thing?" 

But I felt too a pressure to not be concerned with that such as to complain and ask them "where is my bio and why have you changed my title?" The truth is that, together with my colleagues being *accelerated*, I felt a pressure to not say that, to not be mad with that. A pressure asking me to not be worried about that title or my title because the startup in the future needed the founder in the present. That seemed to be what they expected from me, to keeping focusing in being an aspiring founder. 

In another episode in the same program I again came across a moment of frustration about who I had to be; after I had watched a lecture and I pointed to the lecturer that the homework that he asked seemed different from what the written version given in the rule book; and pointed that the written version seemed to be misleading ourselves to do the homework incorrectly. The lecturer, which happened to be one of the program advisors, had quickly replied saying that "this is not an university," which brought a crew of other aspiring founders to laugh hard in the back. So there I was again, frustrated but too feeling a pressure that seemed to be asking me to be more pragmatic and that seemed to expect from me to be an aspiring founder. 

This, in the view of resting which I only could do far later such as when writing this book, there it were a system or space or a stage in a way expecting from us. It may too be the case that I was becoming it, by accepting or embracing, even without noticing or pausing or to be reflective.

A situation illustrated by Steve Blank helps to see how we are evaluating ourselves bu executing based on expectations such as from the outstanding situation. The illustration considers the problems of a startup that sets a founder to do fieldwork but then does so poorly. The challenging point of complication is depicted by Steve Blank:

> *"let's pivot!let's pivot!let's pivot!let's pivot!let's pivot!let's pivot!"*

--> 

If you are not acquainted with the word pivot in the startup situation, this jargon refers to the movement of changing directions when a team is doing X and then gets to do Y. To celebrate the prevalecence of this word is to celebrate too the very aspect that pivoting is part of the startup culture, or built in the lean movement, which explains why Steve is concerned after the fact that one that is essentially tapping a button where many of the doers will be compelled to engage. Therefore, and to help teams to see themselves outside their bubbles, Steve Blank has formulated what he calls the 72-hour rule which essentially forbits the CEO from saying "let's pivot" for a period of 72 hours from after they came back in the builting with that call to action and likely some motivating feedback or arguemnt. 

Now, we shall consider a number of scenarios where the advice of Steve could me helpful. One could be that the founder is obsessive with an idea, as in enamorared under the indicated situation of "no one wants to hear that your baby is ugly." Or, on the other hand, the founder could be enamorated with the process now that she was prompted to "get out from the building" and prompted to and check in the face of the prior or more poorer situation. It could even be the case that the team was sick of working on ideas without any data; that they could not stand being executors of theoretical ideas. So, if on one hand Steve's rule helps these actual teams into awakening, on the other hand it too awakens us to these dynamics when the team might be essentially executing behaviors. Consider that the advice from a team to ask a founder to go outside and get real - given to a founder that spent too much time with ideas - might come from side advice from the team or mentors or others. And moreover, consider that the 72h rule is well respected by everyone given the practitioner's explanation that "one data point is not enough." 

The key point then is to how styles of expected behaviors are being talking among team and how new models of expected behaviors enter's the team's operational repertoire in the rush of doing things, where they get to course-correct their styles with new mental shortcuts, or heuristics, essentially embracing and operating given what is expected of a role.

Recovering our theme, we are yet in the context of when things start, looking at the characteristics of the individuals that forms the startup and how that impacts the future of their startup. We can recapitulate that the parties involved might be onto a vision or a calling or you name it but interested in making a new reality. We have also moved away from that idea of a prior vision which would involve a priourly formed identity of these doers. Thus, we had set ourselves to face that the growth ladder of startups as offering lot of elements that influences the doers, their character, their identities as entrepreneurs. 

And into that, that the realm of passions or motivations - and the things we value - are not limited to the things we do, like our objectives or ideas aimed. Thus, that our passions and motivations are certainly linked to what we think are our most precious resource - the generative engine of the startup - the team. In other words, exactly because we measure our most precious resources, we find ourselves into embracing the outter set of styles, the outer set of characteristics of others doers, from other personalities. In other words, how we shape own identities  can be a concern for the the growth of the startup, and then for the gatekeepers of growth, like investors, which we will consider next - how investors sees entrepreneur's passions influencing their road.

Zooming out now to the perspective of the investors considering founders, let us celebrate a bit from the holistic journey of an entrepreneur as given by Bill Draper, one of the early venture capitalists recognized as a founding fathers of Silicon Valley, that especially invited us to consider how they grow when their startups growth, how they get to be listened, and how their ideas grow like roots: 

> *"Being an entrepreneur is very exciting and, as you know, just reading the papers, entrepreneurs around Silicon Valley here are buying the big houses and they're having a lot of fun. It's a lot of work, it's much harder work. I know, it's really hard work to be an entrepreneur, and it's the highest divorce rate in the country, and so you're taking some risks. But if you love what you're doing, and you will because it's your idea and you're pushing it, and for a while nobody's listening, but then eventually you get people to listen. The thing begins to grow, you begin to get proud, and like a little seed that the oak tree grows, and pretty soon you're taking a lot of the credit for what has been built [..] with your ideas and the people you selected in the beginning, but all of a sudden it's much bigger than you ever expected."* (Draper, 2017, 14:27-15:34)

--> 

if we reverse engineer this life cycle, it is then inescapable to consider that the journey started with nothing much if the perspective of were things has to do with measuring what others would listen from founders. In other words, no one was listening to them. But with that too, it follows from the growth. and success achieved, a logic where people started to listen, and that a conversation happens, and that they might be applauded for the execution, and now are interacting with a lot more people who recognize them as successful which too reinforces their beliefs, their atitudes, their ideas and methods. This situation, under the consideration of being positive, make us to think of their fuel, which certainly is especially in the beginning the resource such the founder's time and motivation or the early team's time and energy that keeps them to persevere and navigate the ambiguous and uncertain space ahead. 

They need to be believers in the first place, and certainly if no passion or connection with factors like a vision - or a mission or a purpose - certainly wouldn't set them to move and would keep them to consider that they are in a boring job and even worse as they don't even get a compensation like a payment. 

But when the situation - as indicated by the "I would do this even for free"  - comes our way, it is then that the early confirmation of our realization that the activities being done produce a feeling of productivity, or safety, or an alignment with a better future, and of a well-being.

Now, these folks and supporters are gatekeepers of the growth of start-ups, happens to be the folks that, across the board, invest after being excited about the passions and aspirations of founders. From an extreme, they can too be investors in a more careless way, such as to a point of allowing the talented team and passionate team to move faster. Even if they know that potential flaws exist, they know too that under the possibility that growth is real, they can bet in the growth and expect that the process takes care of itself. In other words, if the founder shows to be the wrong founder later, they can be fired, and in a way or another their start-up going through growth would give them some outcomes expected by these investors. In other words, that there are acceptable losses that fits well the situation such as a founder that moves from a well-being state to a state of not well-being or so good themselves within our society.

But if some investors are mainly focused on the benefits of passions and expect that the growth takes care of itself, from the perspective of other investors, there are costs and risks that sets them to be concerned with the negative side of passionate teams and the personality or the identities of their startup leaders. If that's not the main risk, these investors may also value the idea that the founders should be around, that when the leaders are around, that's essentially part of the long-term investment, especially applicable if an investor feels that they are in the same boat with these founders. Therefore, if a professional investor respects the benefits of passions, such as when a team had invented a lot in the domain, such as the team's expertise to make a product or service real, they do so with a risk-oriented mindset. In other words, keeping an eye on the destructive force of founders who can be enchanted or too passionate or in love or to a point of missing the elements they are needed to move along with the growth. In other words, they watch out for when the founders entice themselves, such as when they put themselves at risk of disconnection with the rareness that is needed to the next stages in growth. This subject is complex precisely because of the audience, like the market, that is in the future and is not known where the things will go.

In Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital (Stanford, 2013), Howard Hartenbaum a general partner at August Capital, had seen enough interactions with founders to point that even founder's passions and expertise in a given domain - which he recognizes as must have - can become motivators for going full force instead of focusing in the homework and getting involved in checking aspects that could support to reduce the risk to the grow the business. He commented about a situation of a pitch given by founders that were attracted by an idea but missed a major flaw in the business model:

In this sense, the passions of entrepreneurs as seen by investors is also a subject of research, although it is certainly a challenge for researchers to understand the aspects of passions, or to find ways to assess the types of passions that determine more or less success in entrepreneurship. Yet, a window into this space is offered through the quantitative analysis by the research paper by Warnick, Murnieks, McMullen, and Brooks (Warnick, 2018,) which involved asking investors about the types of passions that capture the best investments. The approach in the research had considered the passion for entrepreneurship vs. passion for the product  [^footnote_research_passion_entrepreneurship_product], and its relevancy to investors, which are known traits assumed to be important if a team is interested in materializing innovation in the market. 

[^footnote_research_passion_entrepreneurship_product]: Passion for entrepreneurship have to do with when the founder is aware, interested, engaged, and feels good, with the various aspects involved in the execution the entrepreneurial activities. While passion for the product is oriented to the drive that is motivated by the vision of a product or service. 






Through the research by Bouizegarene et al. (2018), we might respect their intentions to explore how identity processes [^footnote_research_identity_processes] - the things we do that shape our identities - can have an effect in shaping on passions such as to become harmonious and obsessive, and if how that connects with the optimal functioning in society. 

[^footnote_research_identity_processes]: Identity processes refer to dynamics which individuals form, maintain, and develop their sense of self or identity. In the research of Bouizegarene et al. (2018) focuses in two types of identity processes, namely identity integration and identity styles. 

In other words, even if researchers go dig into the specifics and extremmes of driving with passion, their concern sets us to reflect on how we see ourselves, our roles, and how our sense of being in love with what we do  have an effect in our performance, which may sound good, but also on potential narrow views and perspectives.

#### Are they listeners?


An interesting finding in the study help us to understand how investors operate with the growth orientation and using a risk analysis mindset, especially being interested in how founders are driven by passion and interested in knowing when passion is too much to the point of the expected growth. In other words, and because of the flipside of being driven passion can be a risk, they interest may related to the theme of openness to feedback. In other words, without such level of awareness a top-tier investor - such as a top-tier angel investor or a top-tier VC partner involved- might be concerned. Therefore, and if we were in the mood of  jumping to conclusions, one can consider that investors check first how passionate entrepreneurs are, and then, secondly or more qualitatively, how much they are open to feedback in ways that they give up their strict views or behaviors driven by passion, which would be an openness to release themselves from what they know. 

In other words, openness to feedback is a crucial element for investors to be able to help entrepreneurs to conquer their next steps. It follows from the research that blind passion, or unrestrained, can manifest as egocentrism, rigidity, or resistance; impacting the non-participation of investors. It is worth remembering that the role of the investor is the risk analyst of the business relationship with the external environment. In other words, a good investor is concerned about whether the entrepreneur is capable of listening to external feedback, as they know that the final word is from the market, or investors, or other gatekeepers of the growth curve. Thus, the role of investors is also a test, a validation, which is compatible with the various other validations such as the market/customers, competition, etc.

## Shapen by social capital 






The considerations that we have given so far was an invitation to the idea that there is a holistic journey in any entrepreneurial effort allows us to connect the dots for who we are - or to discover our best self. Embodied in that journey, it is then set the consideration that are are activelly coordinating the right protagonist to operate in the given environment ahead of us; that we are activelly testing ourselves and that we are doing so in the face of an audience - expected, implied, or real, or artificial. 

Of course, all of that would only makes sense if we feel the feedback that by embracing a mix of behaviors we would become in a better position, as if were a better tool to solve our objectives ahead. In other words, we are compelled to embrace the role of a protagonist that can take the startup to the next level. So let us then continue into this journey but now to celebrate the challenges - such as how difficult it is to surrender from that protagonist - which feel first-hand when we are driven by the ties with groups such as colleagues, customers, mentors, advisors, and other voices such as the voice of the market, or inspirational leaders, rule books and more. 










<!--
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Social Capital - Situation - Introducing Social Capital. 
--> 







Let us start this reflection with an illustration for how the environment actively invites the doer to embrace a personality. Consider a local accelerator as a partner that exists to challenge, to motivate, to educate to a certain degree, but also to take the founding team into a stage of more potential. Some of the accelerator programs, such as early stages, can start with the situation which they recognize as a place to start. For example, consider one that asks the team to come up with three ideas and to select their best for an upcoming pitch, which is basically a short presentation event where they present in front of judges that in a way represent investor's or the gatekeepers of what is next. And even if what happens at this stage can be considered  artificial, like a selection process based on ideas and communication, it isn't as perceived by the participants due to the actual outcome possibility - that however passes in front of the judges are likely in a position of visibility and to actually get into a more realistic condition of success. In other words, the participants know and feel that that participation, and potential winning, takes them to a step further. No matter for them how artificial something is - it matters more that they can be in a more real situation for the growth. 

In one of the situations that I had participated, I recall from the early feedback I had collected before the pitch that one of my ideas had produced increased level of growth in the pupils of some of the local mentors. The idea had to do with a way for Brazilians to split the bill of a pub more easily. But after my own considerations, I had decided to move on with some other idea - of a slides platform or yet another slides platform, the idea that didn't produce any excitement in the early feedback. Long story short, my pitch didn't do well, the presentation didn't ring any bell or convinced the local judges of its potential. So I got a bad grade and even an assignment - a homework not to say a punishment - that was basically about a chance to get back on track or to be out. But a limited number of others did pass with good scores and stronger claps. One thing I have noticed tough, that in the hurry of things happening I felt like I was back into the "aspiring founder" situation as the winners seemed to be to  have matured, in a way they became something like "pitch winner team" approved by that Silicon-valley-based accelerator program. 

In retrospect, after having considered the feeling of us moving up and down that ladder, it became clear how strong and impactful it can be when we interact with people such as when they seem to be representatives or promoters of what seems to be the situation of growth ahead. In a way, they get to be the resources we so much want to have on our side. That, I sort of knew. Or we knew, especially if we consider that we were beings onto something, like being aware of the tracks we were on. But what I couldn't see at the time were how these social interactions, especially given the short time expectations and outcomes, providing relative measures of success, happened to be perceived as essentially a quest for resources and likely related to the pursuit for social capital and along with that other forms of capital, and how that too has the power to frame us into becoming and embracing our identities, which goes along with the following quote from Amartya Sen in Identity and Violence, The Illusion of Destiny.

> *"Our focus on particular identities can enrich our bonds and make us do many things for each other and can help to take us beyond our self-centered lives. The recent literature on 'social capital,' powerfully explored by Robert Putnam and others, has brought out clearly enough how an identity with others in the same social community can make the lives of all go much better in that community; a sense of belonging to a community is thus seen as a resource - like capital."* (Sen, 2006, p.2) 

<!--

* reference - Sen, A. (2006). Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny. W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.
--> 

With that it comes the provocation for entrepreneurs, that by their affairs to seek and acquire social capital, they are materializing who they are. In other words, the formation of the founder's identity is not discoverd as in launched out of the sudden; an identity of a super hero that goes along with a product launch - althought it is generally visible through these milestones of big launches or when the limelight appears so that the photos can be taken and interviews can be made about who they are and their personalities. But it may be so that an identity is formed following the movement of entrepreneurs and by the interactions with these entities that happens along the way, which goes well with the lean way of doing entrepreneurship where more happens now, through iterations and interactions with the outside.

### Feeling what happens 


Having us considered the idea that founders might embrace personalities as a result of the environment - and that they migth do so under the pressure of what they expect of themselves - I now invite you to reflect about the challenges in the day to day as their perspectives and consequently their decisions can result from who they become. 

Let us go back to Steve Blank's ideas that characterizes a successful founder as one that has to do it because they love and not as a job. Assuming that personality, we may then consider that the characteristic of resillience is present- that he or she should likely more open to the sporadic downs. Another situation that resilience can be inferred from the characteristic of the role is the case of a real stage agent since they are okay with the knowing that the next paycheck is sporadic. In The Start-Up of you, Ben and Reid call our attention to a built-in dynamics of this role:

> *"The real estate agent doesn't know when his next paycheck is coming in. He has ups and downs. He has to hustle to build a network of clients and keep up with changes in the market. His income is humpy, and sporadic big wins (selling a multi-million dollar home) keep him alive."* (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2012, p. 188)

--> 

Now, while there many characterizations of a role rises to the surface - such as of a real estate agent that can be resilience - a further dive into their domain can take us to realize that essentially they become performers as a result of what they expect for their survival. In other words, how a professional real estate agent reacts to the loss of a big sale is different from an arbitrary beginner that takes the job without prior training or advice. We may goes along the managerial notion that the later lacks maturity for that task [^footnote_andygrove_taskrelevant_maturity], that such beginner then suffers more, or struggles more in the face of receiving the no from the first interaction. Along with that, it follows that we think that the beginner can trained and that support and advice is suitable if given by experienced professionals in the field; and that such advice shall help them to be okay with the ups and downs or to be comfortable with receiving the no from prospect, as an examples. 

[^footnote_andygrove_taskrelevant_maturity]: Andy Grove in High Output Management provides an insightful perspective that what we do, and how we perform, is tied to the maturity level for a task. He had mapped levels from low maturity which requires more guidance, to higher degree of maturity where guidance can be strategic.

But that idea of maturity linked to tests, apparently or in theory, hasn't anything to do with one's capacity to see things from perspective. These are essentially two different worlds, except that under the circumstances of the rush and the fast-paced reality of entrepreneurship, things get to be complex, as we essentially may not engage or be provoked to even think from perspective, or to consider that what we're doing is wrong, as if the real problem becomes an attention problem, or that could be the result of over-focusing in what seems to be working, and missing out opportunities to see things from perspective. In other words, an expert in a complex field can essentially operate by instincts as well. For example, an experienced real estate can then instinctively mature to support a note from the prospect, may well be well equipped to dismiss lots of opportunities under the pressure and the familiarity and the comfort that they know is just part of what they do. Meanwhile, from the perspective of an entrepreneur, it's also important, even though they could see things as sales, and real estate agents would be a plus, and yet it's quite important for them to pay attention to the know, so that they can really understand, and consider if the ideas have to be improved.

Furthermore, and to make things more complex, anyone living the situation of a role in the field is likely to feel pressured to react given the circunstances that may call a personality to rise. Consider the following illustration from Robert McKee for how the human can be called and how its rise can be observed by the instincts that sets in: 

> *"In life, if you see a dead body in the street, you are hit by a wave of adrenaline: 'My God, he's dead!' Maybe you run away in fear. Later, when the emotions settle down, you may reflect on the meaning of the death of this stranger, your own mortality, and life under the shadow of death."* (McKee, xxxx)

The illustrated scene by McKee I felt how different people would react, or would engage/disengage into modes and in ways how they quickly respond to what happens given a set of instincts that can gonvern us in the given moment and environment that seem to demand from us. As an exmaple, consider if a paramedic were there too; likely a human that also feels like the other human being in the face of what has happened. However, the paramedic will effortlessly control herself - in ways that her normal instincts would be silenced - in the face her being engaged in "paramedic mode" where other mental shortchuts set her to respond differently. 

Embodied in the illustration from McKee and especially after "emotions settle down," it comes the recognition that we can, to a certain extent, see ourselves from a perspective. This is when we see when we consider "our beliefs" by the re-run of our past as individuals and it then becomes the opportunity for reflection exactly because the characters are now in third person. Let us trust that extended capacity of our operating system where we yet can feel empathy for the others but now being safer, to observe, the reflect about these challenging situations of others.

#### Challenging the superhero

Following that invitation, let us consider a reflection from Melissa Nightingale - a retired startup superhero - where she found herself surprised by her past self in "Why it’s a Mistake to be a Startup Superhero" (2016). The situation that she puts in perspective involves a particular night when she stayed in the office late - and slept in the office floor and stayed overnight - in a state of alert concerned with what would happen next after the fact that her coworker-friends had been held by the police during a protest [^footnote_melissanightingale_superhero] in Washinton DC. 

I urge you to read her article to get the less dramatic picture of a story of basically a group of startup colleagues that were in fact armed with cameras, a website, branded tshirts and self-made laminated press badges. But if I were to take the dramatic photo of a moment where life becomes serious and the heat rises it would be the following: 

> *"We are filming when the police begin mass arrests below. We stop filming when plainclothes FBI agents enter the building and ask to see our ids. We show them our homemade laminated press badges. The photographer next to us shows them her Washington Post press credentials. They demand to see ID. The Washington Post photog refuses. We refuse. They demand again. They say we will be arrested if we don’t comply. The Washington Post photog complies. We comply."* (Nightingale, M., 2016) 

[^footnote_melissanightingale_superhero]: The specific event had to do with the A16 protests. According to Melissa (2016) their startup office was walking distance from the event which brought them into the opportunity to do their coverage alongside with the professionals like CNN and Washinton Post photographers. 

In the end, they weren't actually arrested at that moment - they were just asked to vacate the building. But as some of their startup employees were detained from the mass arrests - with their camera gear held by the police and them in line to be processed - it would then be configured the situation for Melissa of the CEO superhero activated. In other words, from that point on she became available for any eventuality, whether a call, the need for bail, the retrieval of equipment, or anything else. That setting brought her to feel like staying in the office after she felt that "it’s late and I’m tired so I tip over a box of giant branded tshirts." 

It was only in retrospect that she had reflected on her actions and that her sleeping in the office was totally unecessary. It was only in retrospect that she could see that she were perhaps using a resource and that her colleagues could actually need - to be available as a well-rested CEO. As for other things to celebrate, I had enjoyed how she interpreted things and considered the possibility of one that seems to be living inside another self:  

> *"I’m smiling while writing it, remembering a time when I was that young, that idealistic, that green. Sometimes it feels like large parts of my life happened to someone else, me, but a different me somehow. Other times I feel like I’ve lived several lives consecutively, with just the one me but with a narrative that writes itself like rings on a tree trunk."* (Nightingale, M., 2016) 

In addition to that, consider her curiosity for trying to figure out what factors that set her to embrace that personality - the one that drove her to drive under an influence of a particular mix of instincts. And then she also went further to search for the things in the environment such as to consider the startup environment that they were surfing at the time:  

> *"Tech is particularly good at creating the conditions that normalize this blurry line. Between booze in the office, drinks after work, offsites, outings, and all hands it can feel like a bunch of your social needs are well covered during working hours."* (Nightingale, M., 2016)

-->

That observation from Melissa even brought me to (say, wait a minute and) consider that general management observation that helps us to keep culture far from perks. Consider the question that came during the Blitzscaling lectures where someone in the audience had confused perks with culture by more or less asking "Look, every Silicon Valley company has the same culture [perks], you got skateboards and free food and slack and all that," to which John Lilly helped with clarity: 

> *"Culture is profoundly misunderstood... Culture is how you make decisions... And then, culture is both in the things you do and also things you don't do... How you hire, how you talk about your customers, how you talk about your partners, it's everything. It is primarily how you make decisions, from very large decisions to very small decisions."* (Lilly, John., Greylock, )

--> 

It is not my intent to blend perks and culture and bring back the confusion but the points from Melissa helped me to see how even the perks of a space might be in indirectly connected with what make some of us to get culture as "profoundly misunderstood" if you then consider how these *little things* happen to support the building of social bounds in the first place and then it could be that the social bounds could influence how people operate. Think about how Melissa-the-startup-hero were designed, grain by grain, from ideas and ideals from goals or aspirations and a lot more. Think about how the relationships in the day by day strenghtened by their startup's aspirations had materialized their bounds. Think about how that progression had supported her younger one achieve a level of maturity, to embrace an identity or a personality, to become that hero. 

The sum of all that brought Melissa into that situation could be a hint for the Melissa-from-the-future that she would have a hard time to convince Melissa-the-startup-hero if she had a chance to call herself back in time. In other words, that perception that she confirmed by saying that "deep in my closet, behind stacks of skinny jeans and branded hoodies, I’ve got a cape," indeed could only be seen from far. In other words, if Melissa-the-hero had accepted that call she would have hung up the minute she heard - is this Melissa the startup hero? And Melissa from the future would likely have to accept the fact that her self was not the best, just focussing, plain and simple. And that she was too humble and too involved with values. To even consider that anything she was doing had anything to do with being heroic.

This story help us to reason about the possibilities of one in embracing an entrepreneurial identity by the interactions and relationships with others, especially under the environmental and social pressure , and as well how a lot of that can be connected to a perceived reality and even augumeted by our own imagination or the narratives we tell to ourselves and live. If any of Melissa's story seems to be in fact an extremme case - after all some of them got caught by the police - and seem to be too dramatic and far from the startup situation and not part of what can happen, I ask us to keep in mind exactly that notion that the actual heat of action can be seamless and can be cold and it happens in that space of the humble doers where nothing heroic really rises. Thus, I remind us that when we are operating by a particular mix of instincts it may still sometimes appear to be normal work, like when one reads 3am emails and feels like essentially just doing the expected work.

The methaphor given by Melissa - of the superhero wearing a cape - had inspired me to consider how modern tools and brands can also do such a good job in inviting us to embrace certain roles, or personalities, or to embrace an identity.  

Consider how brands are constantly seeking ways to improve their products and their messages. In the methodology from *Building a Story Brand*, Donald Miller identifies a common marketing mistake where brands position themselves as heroes thus essentially competing with their customers. With the Story Brand Methodology, the messages should keep customers as the real heroes thus making the brand as the entity that supports them, like Yoda helps young Luke in Star Wars. What we get as a result of that method is a respect for the logic where a customer's interest into solutions comes after the fact that they identify themselves with the stories - being given by these brands that position their solutions as guides - where people are essentially in a journey of improving themselves: 

> *"What most brands miss, however, is that there are three levels of problems a customer encounters. In stories, heroes encounter external, internal, and philosophical problems. Why? Because these are the same three level of problems human beings face in their everyday lives. Almost all companies try to sell solutions to external problems, but as we unfold the StoryBrand Framework, you'll see why customers are much more motivated to resolve their inner frustrations."* (Miller, Donald., xxxx, p. 31).

<!--

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Identity - Fix the reference to Storybrand. @meta-ref 1212-1222-3322-1233 
--> 

When brands engage in telling the stories of their customers, solving their problems, at these three levels of problems, they essentially are portraying an identity that projects the journey of a hero and attracts their attention of their prospects to join that journey, which is an easy way for a prospect to understand by the celebrations of the very mechanism that we grow by identifying ourselves with others. It was after reading Story Brand that I better understood why real estate companies shows photos of a happy family and a dog jumping. 

But after that, to think that this logic limited to the storytelling of marketing messages at the moment where prospect custommer considers buying things - after they identify themselves with others that had been helped to succeed - brands wouldn't be taking advantage of the full potential to be in touch with them at all times. In other words - and especially considering the digital and networked space - brands are now well-equiped to keep on doing that, to keep them involved, to be trully guiding them to move up the ladder, to keep inviting them to embrace new experiences, to become. 

To explore a bit of how the magic is done I rather use case from the world of video games - before we approach platforms like Whatsapp or Airbnb and more. I am not myself a person that knows or enjoys to take play games or to keep involved under the theme. But my brother used to be, to be able to play in the ways that the game were designed to be played. My problem was that I sometimes wanted to play but was eager to play in the exact place which his player were. In other words, it is like I needed to use pick his sportscar and his wallet to drive around, instead of starting from the beginning with a shity car and an empty wallet. Actually, the game I am thinking in this illustration is exactly about a player that would be mostly driving a car around the city - forgive me for this poor description if you recognize that game. But anyway this poor description also takes us to the concerns of my brother where he would essentially advice me to "hey, don't screw up my reputation." In other words, he were really concerned about the likely possibility of myself driving playing his character and driving around the city like a crazy driver with a lot of police cars and helicopters after me. I mean, him. 

This simple example gives us the opportunity to consider from the technical aspect that there are keys where a user can actually play characters in video games. But the resulting outcome from this experience is exactly what my brother had brought to our attention, that by using these keys he's essentially maintaining the same character in the game and that's why he's so concerned with his reputation. That notion is also known as user profiles or login or online identities.

While this example give us a moment to reflect on how the magic starts, the opportunity for digital platforms to influence identities of people really rised after the fact the social network element came in the scene. In other words, when social networks bloomed, enabling us to connect with others such as to have friends in the a social network, it also bloomed the opportunity for them to influence what we do essentially by allowing us to see what others we doing and how they were acting in the network. To illustrate the potential, the idea of "displaying your status," which is now quite common in many platforms like Whatsapp, Facebook, and more. This idea essentially involves a mechanism where an user is able to share something about themselves but not like a blog. The idea of the status is that statuses go away, they disappear. Now if for the user the thing about sharing your status seem normal - well, this is just an experience where I can let my friends know what I am doing now - another think it is to celebrate how "displaying your status" is seen as a vital element from the point of view of these social platforms; what we can get from the nuanced observation in *The Cold Start Problem* written by Silicon Valley investor Andrew Chen [^footnote_andrewchen_a16z]: 

[^footnote_andrewchen_a16z]: 

> *"Yet across many other platforms, particularly broadcast apps where you share videos or photos widely, the value proposition is displaying your status. No wonder our Instagram feeds are photos of travel adventures, cars, concerts, working out, and so on. Users become addicted to the 'social feedback loop'. You publish content and others see it and engage in the form of likes, shares and comments. When this feedback is positive, it drives the creator to generate even more content."* (Chen, A., 2021, p. 87)

<!--

--> 

The point from Andrew between "displaying your status" and the thing they reffered as "social feedback loop," being linked to what makes "users become addicted," is a just a sampler for us of the magnitude of what can be done once a platform decides to connect users. Starting with that idea of giving users the tools to share their situation - through things like photos, statuses, ranks, credentials, badges, you name it - and then, on the other hand, giving them the means to engage with others, they had essentially brought some interesting things from the stuff that makes life to move on, in terms of how some of us become by following others.  

While we had really celebrated some basic notions, we shall then acknowledge that by now digital platforms really gets a lot more from that stuff from life and how to make us to advance, to act, to engage, to become. Take, as an example, a concept known as *Game Thinking* that were popularized by Amy Jo Kim and applies principles of game design to help companies to engage customers deeply. In a nutshell, game thinking asks platforms to recognize elements of game design - like progress mechanics, rewards, feedback loops, and more - in other to enhance the user experience and engagement in non-game products and services. 

As for a final remark to this section, and bringing us back to the entrepreuneurial situation, we shall celebrate, first, that we too like the normal user are essentially solving our problems by looking for tools and that we engage and decide by looking at the world and how others are solving their problems. That is generally a good news, that we can quickly get what are these tools and what are the right movements to do quickly checking to see how others are doing well with it. But too, implied in all of that, is the idea that entrepreneurial action happens as a calling and that a pressure to do it fast might not always come out too alarming, like real fires, thus that even under pressure a lot of what we do may seem like normal work or just what is expect from us to do. To close, I want to celebrate the observation from Steve Blank about the use of tools are generally overestimated the impact of their use in the beginning: 

> *"When page-layout programs came out with the Macintosh in 1984, everyone thought it was going to be the end of graphic artists and designers. “Now everyone can do design,” was the mantra. Users quickly learned how hard it was do design well (yes. it is an art) and again hired professionals. The same thing happened with the first bit-mapped word processors. We didn’t get more or better authors. Instead we ended up with poorly written documents that looked like ransom notes. Today’s equivalent is Apple’s “Garageband”. Not everyone who uses composition tools can actually write music that anyone wants to listen to. "* (Blank, Steve., 2011)

--> 

If that happens, it may be so too because we are too fast to buy-in into tools by checking on what happens - and looking at showcases and the stories of others like the 1% of top users generally showcased. Thus, we are gravitating to where the lights are, like moths. And sadly too, that by that very overestimation we can be teased too to an awakeking of deception that set in later and take us to give on on them too or to underestimate what really these tools can do for us in the long run.

In the book *The Chaos Machine: How Social Networks Reprogrammed Our Mind and Our World*, Max Fisher (2023) recounts the story of a monk named Wirathu, who was catapulted to fame in Myanmar after the country emerged from a long period of isolation and embraced the Internet and social media. Wirathu's rise and his ability to influence a newly connected nation illustrate the intricate relationship between connectivity, identity, and the potentially destructive power of an unchallenged alternate reality.

Wirathu's story begins with a dark past, confined to an environment of hate during his imprisonment. However, his homeland, Myanmar, underwent significant transformations during his detention, including the widespread adoption of the Internet and social media, largely thanks to a partnership with the United States. In partnership with Silicon Valley leaders and former President Barack Obama, Myanmar made a rapid transition to the digital age.

As a result, the Internet - particularly platforms like Facebook and YouTube - became a stage for Wirathu to communicate with followers and increase his influence. According to Fisher, Wirathu enjoyed a popularity that propelled his communication with the world in a way that was unimaginable before the Internet era. Previously, he would have had to travel across the country to spread his words and gain followers. On social media, however, Wirathu's words were amplified by the users themselves, driving a biased narrative. According to the story as he "accused the Muslim minority in Myanmar of horrendous crimes, mixing rumors with fabrications" (Fisher, p.55, our translation), he had created an alternate reality that became alarmingly mainstream thanks to his celebrity status.

--> 

Fisher highlights that the people of Myanmar were introduced to Facebook in an already developed state, creating a kind of digital explosion. Consequently, as users engaged with social media, they built or reinforced their identities. The popularity and echo within the support group became projections of the reality fueling a confirmation bias that overlooked any counter-argument. Therefore, users came to interpret the popularity of a post or figure like Wirathu as a validation of their beliefs and perceptions, strengthening their identity while simultaneously creating a cycle of bias confirmation that amplified the alternative narrative. 

In a notable episode, this dynamic culminated in violent attacks on the Muslim minority, motivated by information spread through social media. Wirathu and Myanmar's case, as described by Fisher, highlights the power of social media in a newly connected society. What were once unconfirmed fragments of beliefs became, in the digital age, mass validation of an alternative identity and narrative, providing users with a distorted sense of reality and morality. 

Now, and besides the reflection given by Walter about the urgency of addressing the spread of misinformation and hatred on social media aiming a safer and more inclusive digital future, it is innevitable to now consider the scenario that the system had created Wirathu; that he had evolved it is clear. But it can be difficult to see that Wirathu were not into a discovering of his true self but it were in fact onto embracing a potential. In other words Wirathu might have been accelerated by its growth space he nurtured. It's the chicken and egg problem.

## Beyond the self  






If not because of what we have considered, it might be generally heard that entrepreneurship involves the elements of art and science. For many times, when I heard that idea I felt uncomfortable in a way. As in on one hand I wanted to deny the art component and on another hand I couldn't really fully give up on that. The reason for so may have to do with what brought them to start, where innocence is alive. This is what took them to do, to be practical and yet it is what allows them to see the world from a different point of view. To enter that space, to try to make the impossible possible, they have to position themselves between the world as we know it and a new world as they have seen. This may go well with the comparison given by Steve Blank between founders and composers: 

> *"Founders fit the definition of a composer: they see something no one else does. And to help them create it from nothing, they surround themselves with world-class performers. This concept of creating something that few others see – and the reality distortion field necessary to recruit the team to build it – is at the heart of what startup founders do. It is a very different skill than science, engineering, or management. Entrepreneurial employees are the talented performers who hear the siren song of a founder’s vision. Joining a startup while it is still searching for a business model, they too see the promise of what can be and join the founder to bring the vision to life. Founders then put in play every skill which makes them unique – tenacity, passion, agility, rapid pivots, curiosity, learning and discovery, improvisation, ability to bring order out of chaos, resilience, leadership, a reality distortion field, and a relentless focus on execution – to lead the relentless process of refining their vision and making it a reality."* (Blank, 2011)

--> 

But embodied in this big idea there is the something other key about entrepreneurship and what makes entrepreneurs entrepreneurs, because in order "to lead the relentless process of refining their vision and making it a reality," is to be open to provoke the vision too. Moreover, this artistic or innocent or daring entrepreneurial perspective may well be helpful to guide us to escape the negative side of the calling - when we had embraced a perspective, a personality, leading to a way of acting. 

To embrace being open to change is really something that has to do with denying the very views that we might have embraced in the first place. In the entrepreneurial domain it is surrendering yourself from the successful entrepreneur that you just became. Just like a writer has to reset if they want to win again and just like an artist has to reset so that they do it again. I would think that this phenomenon is just part of life and the process of reinvent ourselves in the face of the need. This is a major part of the entrepreneurial function. Moreover, I think that what makes us wonder if artists and entrepreneurs have something in common could be a lost cause because the case from art that connects with that could be explained by the same entrepreneurial function in the artists. In other words, an artist can access too this entreprenurial function. From the world of writers, I think that an advice from Jordan Peterson about writing essays is a great example of this function appearance from within the work, from within the act of using writing to achieve clarity, which according to him is the point of the essay: 

> *"You don't want to stop, and you don't want to criticize yourself. You don't want to worry about how the sentences are formulated and all of that. And then you have a bad first draft, which is a wonderful thing to have, because it's way better to have a terrible first draft than to have nothing at all. And then you can edit it, and you have to assume that what you're going to do when you edit is throw away like 80% of it, and if you know that to begin with when you're writing, then it loosens you up, because who cares if what you're writing is perfect if you're going to throw 80% of it away. So, you can afford to take some risks and to write down some things that that you're not going to keep that you might not even think are reasonable, because you're exploring and you know you can take chances, because you're going to throw 80% of it away anyways. And then it turns out that if you're willing to throw 80% of it away -- it's sort of analogous to be willing to throw 80% of yourself away as you learn through life.*" (Peterson, Jordan., 2021)

### Reinventing - back to the beginner 



In the beginning of this chapter I brought the first part of a speech from Steve Jobs where he had set us to consider how difficult it is to connect the dots - from the experiences of our lives - as things happens. From that, and having us considered the challenges from a bundled entrepreneurial identity that is assumed as the dots seem to connect, I invite us now to go back to second part of Steve's speech when we gave us a situation of where set us to reflect about the complex situations when what we become may as set us to in a trajectory to be called to reinvent ourselves, or to unbundle what we have made of ourselves or with the better words of Steve where the "heaviness of being successful" needs to be "replaced by the lighteness of being a beginner again". From far from above, where we arrive is the realization the calling may also too set us in front of points of inflection, when we are essentially being called to re-evaluate all that it happens: 

> *"My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.* (Jobs, Steve, 2005)

--> 

That can be too iconic, especially when we are witnessing Steve Jobs, and too condensed indeed as a good story for the audience demands. But we should not take our attention away from how slow things happen, as he had given to us in that first part of the same speech, the difficulty to get what is going on, to connect the dots. In other words, the talk is short but the construction is a lifelong journey. This second part, and the wall he had found, is too an outcome from a construction. In other words, Steve is too giving to us the precise suggestion that he brought him too to that wall. But then too he did a good job to give us the opportunity to see failure from perspective, and again how slow that may happen: 

> *But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything."* (Jobs, Steve, 2005)

The situation of Jobs is special indeed, and it might seem to iconic that sometimes we may think that these moments have to be something that like. But when we hear from Steve, it touches us, as we recognize the truth and validity of the perspective given. But from that inspiration and valuable reflection, Steve is giving us an iconic reflection to think about from the connecting the dots perspective. Yes, the higher wall he had found served for him and us as something so iconic so that we can take lessons. But if we go back to his point about connecting the dots, I feel that it connected to me that similarly to that situation of not knowing how to connect the dots, we can be too be taking ourselves into and bundling ourselves. Steve had given to us the iconic story of the being that is bundling without noticing and it is then called to unbundle. Yes, it was out of the sudden, in a way. But if it appears to be like that, none of us can say as we weren't there inside of him to see all the things going on and even the events taking him into that specific wall in time.

### Releasing - from the successful duty 



Fortunately, like the case of Steve Jobs, I would think that other reflections are alive to us because they had survived that call for change. Now let us then consider the reflections from Andy Grove about the moments that have called for change, as Intel were going through what he had referred as 10x force - when the major ship needed to change when and the challenging situation of being leaders of a major organization that were very successful and where a force, quite natural, would call for inaction instead of a call that calls for reinventing, which took Intel to be a company we know of today, to be a microprocessor company, instead of just yet another example of a company that were buried and taken by the japanese. 

I enjoyed Andy's reflections because he kept going back to the being - to the self - and to consider the states of emotion of executives driving large organizations, even brought up an analogy for how one can go through the phases of grief. The recognition of the case of Andy about Intel's challenge to rethink the identity of the executive team, their position, and the theme that Andy brought where they were able to challenge themselves, himself and Gordon, the conversation in the office when they looked at the Great America ferriswheel. 

If we set our time machine to 1985, and land ourselves in the Ferris wheel of the Great America park in Santa Clara California, we would be able to point our binoculars to Intel's headquarters and witness that special conversation between Andy Grove and Gordon Moore, as documented in *Only The Paranoid Survive*, the conversation that marks a moment of transcendence from Intel management that took them to "The bold decision to commit Intel’s future to microprocessors," [^foonote_hbr_intel_1996] which brought Intel a major transformation to the world, that consumers get that Intel meant the computer's brains: 

[^foonote_hbr_intel_1996]: The article from HBR titled "Inside Intel" by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff (1996), underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of industry crises and technological shifts. In essence, the article considers Intel's journey through significant challenges, including the competitive pressure from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers in the mid-1980 which led to a strategic pivot from memory chips to microprocessors, and how the success from transformation brings new challenges, like a totally new game or sport where the organization has to transcend in order to survive.  

> *"I remember a time in the middle of 1985, after this aimless wandering had been going on for almost a year. I was in my office with Intel's chairman and CEO, Gordon Moore, and we were discussing our quandary. Our mood was downbeat. I looked out the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon and asked, 'If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?' Gordon answered without hesitation, 'He would get us out of memories.' I stared at him, numb, then said, "Why shouldn't you and I walk out the door, come back and do it ourselves?'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 89)

Now if that moment had gained that picture; it is the picture of invitation that recognizes the roles of the being into the major problem and how the marutity that we achive, especially in the situations of the major ship, become acting forces on us. We flip this postal and it would like Andy is asking us - keep here with me, let us talk about a lot else that happens with us, and the subtitle things that we may not even note if we are not aware. One aspect to consider is what Andy had notice - our willingness to escape: 

> *"Escape, or diversion, refers to the personal actions of the senior manager. .. In my view, a lot of these activities are motivated by the need of senior management to occupy themselves respectably with something that clearly and legitimately requires their attention day in and day out, something that they can justify spending their time on and make progress in instead of figuring out how to cope with an impeding, strategic, destructive force."*  (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 124-125)

That is a different kind of photo and reflection to us. To notice how we might show signs when we have a puzzle in front of us. He went on to celebrate that "At such times, senior managers often involve themselves in feverish charitable fundraising, a lot of outside board activities  or pet projects." (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

> *"At such times, senior managers often involve themselves in feverish charitable fundraising, a lot of outside board activities  or pet projects. Take a look at a representative calendar of the CEO of a major corporation that was in the middle of a strategic inflection point (page 126). Does his allocation of time, his most precious resource, reflect the strategic crisis? I don't think so."*  (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

One other special observation from Andy have to do with his observation to make a parallel between the writing his book with the challenging situation of Intel. Now, it serves for us here too how his reflection which consited of revisiting his history and reflecting on his prior book writing time served too as a reflection for him later - the moment when he were writing the above book, Only The Paranoid Survive:

> *"Frankly, as I look back, I have to wonder if it was an accident that I devoted a significant amount of my time in the years preceding our memory episode, years during which the storm clouds were already very evident, to writing a book. As I write this, I wonder what storm clouds I might be ducking now. I will probably know in a few years."*  (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* reference - Grove, Andrew. (1999). Only the Paranoid Survive: How to Exploit the Crisis Points That Challenge Every Company. [Só os Paranóicos Sobrevivem]. Crown Publishing.
--> 

Certainly his reflections gave him the means to be asking - wait a minute, am I here again engaging in these activivities of another nature, like writing? From these observations, I think that first and inescapable is the duty the necessity of being thankful to Andy, for getting involved to reflect and to write it, to put it as words, to all of us, and as he shown to give us an enlightening one as he set himself open. It is unescapable the self in the action, the being, in both High Output Management and and Only the Paranoid Survive. Moreover, we shall too observe that Andy's insatisfaction from his "allocation of time, his most precious resource," and the situation of crisis that Intel were going through, were the actual tip for how the situation goes, naturally as while things are happening there is not a sign of the major crisis written in flags and elsewhere. 

Thus, the disconnect given in retrospect is only the invitation for us to celebrate that us to be engaging in the new, in divergent activities, might be the sign of us in front of the unsolvable, the realization that would call for change. It may be even considered, although he didn't write about that, that the very activities of writing served for him as a reflection. 


Andy had considered too the connection betweem the situation of challenging for changing, with the very prior steps of success. For him, he referred to it as a phenomenon, "I will call this phenomenon the inertia of success. It is extremely dangerous and it can reinforce denial. "* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125). ANd went on to give us enough information to celebrate that our movement towards growing also shapes maturity and inertia in us, and how that may well add to the challenging situations for us to change ourselves: 

> *"Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to lead with their strengths. So it's not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers, especially during their 'championship season.'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

To note: We are talking about a senior manager, an educator, a chemical engineer, a reader of manager to name some characterizations of Andy. Clearly telling us that it happens like that, that we become and by becoming we get stuck. And when we get stuck, we defend ourselves. And when we defend, it may appear - although in retrospect - to be movements of a child:  

> *"When the environment changees in such a way as to render the old skills and strenghts less relevant, we almost instinctively cling to our past. We refuse to acknowledge changes around us, almost like a child who doesn't like what he's seeing so he closes his eyes and counts to 100 and figures that what bothered him will go away. We too close our eyes and are willing to work harder, to dedicate ourselves to our traditional tasks or skills, in the hope that they and hard work will get us there by the count of 100. "* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

### Witnessing - from history 






Now we know what these stories of Jobs and Andy Grove are truly telling us, how meaningful they are as advice, especially that they were called to do that to. We have also celebrated that ourselves to be in this position of re-runing stories, became a powerful exercise for awareness. 

<!-- 
@note 
The following whole section is from https://medium.com/startup-check-in/let-there-be-light-our-ancestor-entrepreneurs-and-your-next-startup-ideas-cc64c4573bb8 
--> 

Thus, it serves well to us to be evident about that, more precisely. This noticing of how interesting is to look at the stories of other entrepreneurs, to be learning with them, is a well-respected element among the from minds people that are concerned with entrepreneurship and concerned with the challenges of the doers. 

When Patrick Collison was invited to talk about his fast-growing company at the Technology-enabled Blitzscaling classes, instructor John Lilly pointed out that “he walked in with a book made of paper, which is always very exciting.” Further down the interview, John wonders why he has so much interest in history.

For Patrick, it’s a way to cheat. Everyone else ignores all the good ideas from history, and so you can just be much smarter by just, you know — you could just try to think all these incredibly original thoughts by sort of sitting down and staring at the wall for days on end — or you can sort of cheat by just, you know, I mean they are, in fact, written down in books that you can just read. (Patrick Collison — Greylock Partners, 2015, 11:17)

Patrick’s point almost passed without myself noticing what is so special. But it turns out that I was reading an amazing history book - The Power Makers, by historian Maury Klein - at the time, which helped me to reflect and consider why entrepreneurs should read about history such as history of technology, history of entrepreneurs, and more. 

When great historians drag us back in time, they help us better understand how factors, such as the external environment, such as period and the cultural environment, have an effect in entrepreneur’s decisions and goals. It’s like you are transported into the protagonists but also giving the protection so that you are not lost like a protagonist. The protection is the space of opportunity to reflect about the currents of the time, the factors influencing, challenges, and more. 

It provoke us into questioning things like what brings us to come up with ideas? Is it pain? Or love? Or a major obstacle on their way? Is it a vision or an epiphany, after he had long years of thinking and living through challenges first-hand? What made them pursue a life of entrepreneurship? what factors contributes for us to persevere for decades?

Connecting the dots leading to innovation. The view from above, or from the cockpit with a narrator using the time capsule, might also give us the view of hot the dots are connected, for how inventors bring their ideas to market: from the background, to how the idea first appeared, moving to how they evolved into an early product, showing the potential pitfalls or how ideas are brought to the market.

It’s like a view from the above that conciliates how external factors are influential to entrepreneurship. What pitfalls we can find? What obstacles appears in front of us? What are the conditions that can favor the further development of our goals? Will the environment be friendly in the short, medium and long run?

It’s great to learn about successes. But historians will also tell you about the failures; and more, the failures of first movers, such as the life and death of inventors and entrepreneurs that could not bring their ideas as they have envisioned, and the potential later realization, by others, of what those first movers had envisioned. This level of contrast help entrepreneurs to better understand a macro view for how inventors and inventions correlate and collaborate in the long run and the leadership compoment that mad things to become real. 

Consider the situation of John Fitch which is credited as one of the inventors of the commercial steamboat service. His product, Perseverance, was launched in 1790 as a commercial steamboat service but didn't do well and was abandoned. 15 years later, as history shows, a successfully implemented solution was brought by Robert Fulton, that was a bit less inventor and more of an assembler and able to focus on the service. 
 
> *“Fitch advertised the service heavily and the boat performed admirably — going five hundred miles before suffering mechanical problems — but the passengers did not come. In desperation, the partners offered free food and drinks on board, but every voyage continued to lose money. What had proven to be technological triumph turned out to be a commercial failure, and the service was abandoned after that first summer. His investors backed away, and Fitch eventually found himself nearly penniless once again.”* (Klein, 2009, p. 46)

Reading how amazing inventions were born helps us soften our minds and better recognize how much biased we are, how humble we should be. Consider the situation of Ampere and Coulomb which were convicted about the lack of relationship between electricity and magnetism, leading to the general acceptance that no relationship existed between these areas. Such belief persisted for about 20 years, when suddenly however an unknown professor hits a discovery by chance: It was during an experiment with his students when professor Oersted were melting wires and noticed that a compass moved every time the electricity was being turned on/off.

After such discovery Oersted published a paper. While Ampere priorly did not believe in such relationship, this was a real experiment, therefore easy to replicate. From that moment, Ampere not only accepted but he immediately started contributing to this new field in a matter of two months.

In the above passage, new opportunities appeared after that irrefutable observation of effects of the physical world, enabling the status-quo of scientists to be dropped quickly. They other words, they had to accept change as their environment was changing. 

Productizing an idea depends on many factors such as vision and engineering capacity. But it won’t necessarily mean your target customer is ready to accept the proposed and envisioned product. And even if they are, it does not mean that all the forces in the future will favor your product to enter and sustain itself in the market.

### Changing goggles 








It could be considered that I went too far to formulate our problem as a problem of an identity that is formed from the entrepreneurial action and with that that the success can also be a source of problems.  But if I did that, it may be in part excused to a certain extent by a naïve element from entrepreneurship that sometimes we see a bridge but one is temporary to set us to reach an end; which led me to consider that our attachments with groups or entities or frameworks or tools and more can take us feel connected, to feel encouraged, to feel supported. In other words, to consider that what we become, the characterizations that we acquire, are tied them. 

Having considered that, I shall also say that I we shouldn't honour our the good side of that. That if any potential trap happens to be configured, if might do so because we happen to trust an engine that works. In other words, that our operating system is donig what it were programmed to do, to seek for improved efficiency given our goals; the engine that allow us to measure the feedback and to conceptualize from the experiential action and account values and that by the evaluations of our behaviors we then may encounter, only in retrospect, ourselves fultilling our own prophecies or to take what happens more lightly to be essentially scoring how we are doing under the goal to be moving in the right direction. As for the good things, I would assume that those could be estrapolated from the flipside of this chapter and the abundance of materials, the exact environment around that is always ready to tease us to keep feeding our beasts. 

But now the concerns of this chapter are valid - the flipside of the successful doer the moment that they become - it is because we are essentially trying to save ourselves from the traps of being over-focused in one or other perspective, under the hope that we can embrace perspectives that can save us from trouble; especially in the face of the growth [^footnote_paulgragam_growth] situation of their startups as we have considered in a prior chapter, the things which are excepted of a startup; the situation as supported by Paul Graham: 

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth."* (Graham, 2012)

* Note - Check outline, because under Vision we had a section with the case of Brian and learner. "* Answer - Infinite learner? Situation is of New Sport. Complication is Transition needs. Solution is humble. More than infinite learner, infinite apprentice. (p. 169)"

* points from Lost and found 

In a previous chapter, especifically in the section Infinite Apprentice, we have considered the advice from Brian Chesky and Reid Hoffman, the idea of the infinite learner, which brought up the challenges of a leader accross the growth stages. Brian reminded us that is not like one becoming more skilled in an art; and instead it has more to do with having to learn a new sport. Brian, therefore, might be a good example that the infinite apprentice is connected with the an inner and humble spirit that enables transformation.

But then by recognizing the situation of Brian, we should take in the consideration the context too, to force ourselves to recognize what he had revealed too about the network of knowledge and learning how to learn - the idea of accessing the best books would be an element - either people or by great books. 

Also the location and timing - that he and his cofounders were in a space that were considered top-tier, YCombinator, and the eventual connection with Reid Hoffman too. Now notice the complexity as Brian and his team moved up the ladder - having entered YCombinator - and the point where they recognized that YC almost didn't invest. 

--> 



There are a lot of enlightened formulations that are giving us the understanding and colors to the challenging situation of being a leader when the startup goes through growth. Throughout the Blitzscaling lectures, Reid Hoffman kept on focusing on essentially asking most of the interviewed leaders about the challenges of scaling but making sure to focus in the challenges from the perspective of the leader that essentially is going through "what got you here is not what will get you there."[^footnote_blizscaling_brianchesky_got_you_there] To point an example consider the how Michael Dearing prioritized talking about the challenges of the growth phases when Reid asked how founders can evaluate themselves as founders:

--> 

[^footnote_blizscaling_brianchesky_got_you_there]: In Blitzscaling lecture number 18 (2015), Reid Hoffman asked Brian about the challenges of being a leader when the startup is going through the growth stages of Blitzscaling; to which Brian pointed out first about the absence of guidance for these transitions, stressing that leaders must evolve their perspective because the situation demands a whole new mindset as if the leader is being exposed to a whole new sport on every phase.

> *"First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to, hopefully God willing, turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)

The inescapable truth from looking from above, the whole situation of the startup exists on one hand, and on the other hand, the growth situation for the founder and the leadership team should go along with. And naturally, it is implied that if we don't know where we're going - not exactly and not entirely and nor the means to make that growth happen - then we are essentially navigating a space by doing from our position of learning - and the implied establishment of perspectives - given that we are seeking outcomes; which set us to then be concerned with provoking our views with real views such as the views of how market will respond. 

In other words, this is essentially about being into the art and science in the sense that any innocent or naïve or visionary creation is essentially being subject to refinement. So naturally, the characterization of this evolution can be evidenced by the interactions - with partners and advisors and mentors and investors and customers and users and other perspectives given by entities of many kinds - and the understanding of the domain or the philosophical inference of the transformation that is being proposed. That's an essential truth. 

Moreover, it is implied too from such truth that any of us are well equipped to engage with the interactions with the external environment in order to seek for answers - cofounders, advisors, mentors, and more - but still, and under the perspective of the concerns of this chapter, we should recognize that such attempt to seek for answers can be pointless if one is not to a certain extent interested in being a learner and in challenging themselves in the first place. Of course, because the end measure is not just the interaction with the external. That doesn't solve anything. The measure needs to be a serious commitment with the idea of seeking beyond plain answers and of the order of acquiring a new perspective; or to challenge our views. 

Furthermore, if we find ourselves inclined to accept listening and seeking out new views to our perspectives, that shall well be a construction and allowance that we set to ourselves. In other words, it comes too from inside of us - which is not so different from the internal movement and what it takes for a person to go seek a psychologist or a mentor or an advisor for any subject.

But of course, we understand too - from our culture and fast-paced inclination to fix things after the fact - that we are generally induced to keep on learning in retrospect - after we knock our aheads - which is why we shall close this chapter with a few more celebrations about the challenges of change or the challenges of challenging ourselves. 

As for the final illustration of this chapter, I want to go back to the situation of us and tools - or us versus tools under the new terms - or the situation where we can be enamorated with tools which is what had happened with me through my own jorney as I became a writer throught the development of this book. And then, to close with the wider and wiser views that can inspire us to seek inside in us the beginner the naive the humble or to keep ourselves in the state that Steve Jobs took from "The Whold Earth Catalog," his plea to "Stay Hungry, stay foolish." 

#### Dancing with the AI writer robot 

When I had explored the affairs between us and tools - trying to explore if any identity could be formed from interacting with tools - I wasn't 100% into the direct and indirect potential effects from the simple situation when the human is acquainted with a tool. Think about what comes - as a bonus - if we take a time machine and witness a father making a hammer to his kid in the late 1700s. And then, let us move forward to another father passing on Smith & Wesson pistol to his kid in the late 1800s. Or yet in the late 1800s another kid gets a Remington No. 1 typewriter. And then another kid gets an Apple II computer in the late 1900s. Likely nothing much comes as a bonus. These are tools that can do nothing. These fathers, on the other hand, had told them what to do with the tools. And have likely guided them a bit not only in terms of how to use but they too have illustrated to them, have given to them, some narratives as for what to do with these tools and who they could become. These narratives were part of the process, the guidance, the manual. Now we are in a world where a lot of tools exist but also the guidance part gets to be communicated in new ways. In other words, as we have considered, tools are telling us how to do and who we can become. 

Setting our time machine to my own story not so long ago, we will witness how I turned out to become skilled with a tool and how I had achieved success that may have influenced my actions and perspectives as a writer. Somehow I got motivated about my developments with a tool, I saw myself as one that is skilled with this tool, right when I was facing the struggles of the development of my career as a writer, which I believe might be one of my identities by now. These were the days when I happened to meet this tool, this artificial intelligence tool entitled Chaffee PT made by OpenAI. I first found it fascinating that I could ask the tool to write. After I had put some bits and pieces of logic and asked it to produce an article, I was fascinated even more, especially given that I had suggested a logic for the structure as for how their story then goes. I caught myself ordering it to do things and having fun as well, like, no, that's not what I have asked of you, I want you to use a more scientific tone and less marketing orientation. I want you to use a plain and simple English, like the kind of English that William Zinsser would accept as interesting. And then I have given further instructions for the logic of my articles as well, like reminding the tool of how important it is to show a problem, to bring up a complication in the beginning as part of the introductions of the articles, and a lot more. The tool did an amazing job, even to a point of making me work a lot more than I would normally do. I'm especially proud that the artificial intelligence tool made me work.

So then I was able to also publish a couple in an online publication and even received a promotion. It should be noted that this promotion was a badge, a recognition. To defend myself, I wasn't cheating; and I had developed an extensive interaction and kept the control for all the words it had produced either by asking it to edit to the level of paragraphs and then editing myself the final paragraphs. Anyway the point is that the tool had led me to write better articles - where I didn't need anything else to support the view of myself becoming a better writer - but the result from using it had given to me support to that too, through the badge of being a contributor to that publication. 

But then, I might have brought myself to find some trouble from that too. I was, out of the sudden and likely after having given that "raise" or "promotion", passionated or feeling proud of myself. I had considered who I were and then I felt like being a sort of composer, being able to tell the robot to engage in many specific activities. And then I felt too that I was getting better in the art and science of controlling that robot. Moreover, I may have evolved into the movement I also caught myself struggling, and being a bit confused, or to be working for the robot too, or being influenced by the interactions that it had created. Through my interactions, yet when I was yet promoting the robot's amazing work and being proud of my ability to control it,  I happened to share thoughts about my discoveries with a great professional writer. At some point, she told me to "not make a dance or song about a simple activity." She didn't like how I was focusing in explaining to her about how I happened to be using the tool asking the tool to do things for me. She has told me to "think it through," and she reminded me that my brain was tool. That was an inflection point for me, an awakening. For me writing wasn't simple. 

But as I provoked her to point that I was becoming a sort of master of a an AI writing tool, she too provoked me by saying that the writing were simple. For me, a couple lessons followed: One, that I have left the position or the consideration to think of myself as someone like a master of a tool. In other words, I took myself out from the trap of thinking that I were a champion by being able to have full control over the tool. After having liberated myself from that notion, I then realized that was  essentially getting used, or lost, of confused, by the communication interactions with the tool. In other words, as my trust created a perspective of being a master, I was taking myself to be controlled by the tool and to be stuck into that perspective, not being able to release myself from it such as to be able to write and to see writing a simple activity. 

Naturally other thoughts too had helped me to release myself from that spot, such as when I read from Julia Cameron - from The Right to Write - great thoughts about the importance of writing by asking my editor-critic to stay aside which took me to give full permission to write with errors which had taken my writing to be closer to myself which had taken me to write things from my heart instead of being busy trying to write what is right. Having liberated myself from the situation of being the controller of a tool - and the effects of being controlled by the tool - I kept on using the tool but with a whole new perspective. To give you an example, I had asked the tool to give me the dates for a well-known pistol manufacturing company around the American Civil War, the dates for when Apple II was released, that kind of thing. Plus, I had asked the tool to read some of my drafts and to make a summary - as in trying to simulate what a specific kind of audience would take from an essay. Notice the difference - I kept in the space not of a controller or a master. I moved myself to the position of a being open. I have accepted that writing is a simple activity, to a certain extent. I have accepted that I could write with errors, to a certain extent. I have accepted that this AI tool is amazing, to a certain extent. In other words, I moved from the spot of being a controller to being humble. It took me to write for more than 150 days as a job and to grow the draft from 300 pages to 600 pages. I took me to understand better the themes too, to connect with the audience, to connect with myself, to connect with these so many sources that are helping me - sources from inside of me and outside, like these great authors. 

Now if I were in fact forming an identity - such as of an AI writer-master - I can't say and it would be again an attempt to go too far. But I would say that the awakening - the call from that great writer - was enough to let me get away from that idea of an identity as a value, or to get away from a status that had a strong dependence with that tool. The liberation from that potential position brought me back to just be okay with myself being the whole Marcio which is more useful to a book than an specific Marcio. To detach myself from that identity or personality or character- you name it - it felt like I had supported myself to be back to my own whole self which may go along with the thinking of Amarthya Sen in Identity and Violence: 

> *"In our normal lives, we see ourselves as members of a variety of groups - we belong to all of them. A person's citizenship, residence, geographic origin, gender, class, politics, profession, employment, food habits, sports interestsm taste in music, social commitments, etc., make us members of a variety of groups. Each of these collectivities, to all of which this person simultaneously belongs, gives her a particular identity. None of them can be taken to be the person's only identity or singular membership category."* (Sen, 2006, p.2)

Now, to close, and going back to thoughts from Michael Dearing, I would like to celebrate this calling where he is inviting founders to be aware of their behaviors, especially given the space where we can be pressured to execute, that calling that we may do what we do and may do it too in love with what we do:  

> *"Human beings have a knack for observing, forming judgments, and taking action. When you state it like this it seems pretty linear and rational, whether you’re talking about individuals or people working in teams. Cognitive behavior theory says automatic thoughts color and distort our observations, our judgments, and our actions."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

As Michael had looked at the work of Aaron Beck - cognitive behavior theory - he had found something for us to do about ourselves instead of letting us do what we do as if we were static, as if we were just a personality that fits or not in a position:

> *"Beck’s theory of cognitive behavior described how observations, judgments, and actions are tinted and changed by automatic thoughts. These automatic thoughts come to mind without even trying. They reflect deep beliefs about self, past experiences, and expectations for the future, and they have a profound impact on judgment and behavior."* (Dearing, M., 2017)

If I couldn't link to the article, I would summarize the above as "if we are too fast to do, consider how fast you are in assuming that you are what you are." But, I can link and I strongly invite you to read Michael's article because it will set us in a new place, to gain a perspective such as that a lot of superpowers of founders can be seen from a different perspective, such as to be distortions and that they can be constructed. It may indeed be uncomfortable - such as to account as well that to be calling a superpower is just the perspective of one that is in the hurry and does not have time to see the half empty glass - but I take that it is a happy news for us that we can gain a perspective from cognitive behavior theory and to know that we are essentially  nurturing ourselves and that while we may generally think that we can't do much in terms of who we are - as in when we think that we would need to take a detour to treat our beings psychologically - it matters then even more to know that there are real things that we can do in terms of improving our behaviors and that to be concerned with that can be and should be part of management, the management of the self that is essential to lead the management of the whole.
