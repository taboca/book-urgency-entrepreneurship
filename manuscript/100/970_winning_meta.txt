## Review

* ( ) Check if Maslow and the situation of the salesman wasn't already included in other chapter - "The notion for splitting the love" resonates with the view of the present salesman vs. future enlighted salesman which is pointed by Abraham Maslow in Maslow on Managenent.

* Consider the situation with Blitzscaling, p.289 and p.301 for the responsible Blitzscaling and requirement of Blitzscaling for the entrepreneur, which is to be an always learner, p.301, and also what Reid and Chris referred as paradox, p.301, which has to do with a need for estability and peace, which is a requirement which seems to aligh with diversity. 

* ( ) Consider learning ? Of Reid Hoffman?
