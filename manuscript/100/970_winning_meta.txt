The problem with the situation, and the necessity, of growth of the individuals, or the transcendence of entrepreneurs working on startups, arises from the two-fold challenging path ahead of them. First, is that they, the team, start alone in regards to their own educational path searching for answers. We will get back to this as we first recognize the second part, which considers the necessity of growth which happens when, in the face of risks, an investor entity joins the boat. That entity can self investing by the team or including others like customers, investors, and more. 

In other words, most projects start small and, if goes well, tend to grow in a way or another. The condition of Blitzscaling, as suggested by Chris Yeh and Reid Hoffman, offers a metaphor that starts with family and grows into tribe, city, and nation [^editornote_review_blitzscaling_phases]. That is a quite unique growth perspective that shows how an organization evolves. There are others models, or perspectives, which growth happens in different ways, such as when a small team doesn't seek form venture capital investors but nevertheless a form of investing happens such as when customers are paying beyond the cost and offering a margin that supports growth. Thus, nevertheless, it is generally the case that an evolution is expected and that growth can be seen as a sign of maturity, although the configuration of growth can be unique depending on what and how things are undertaken. Using this growth perspective, it can help us to recognize the necessity of the investment effort in the face of risk. Of course, the size of investment varies depending on factors such as the analysis of the opportunity and risk. Still, no growth happens if a supporter willing to invest is not present. The supporter can be a father figure, a mother company, an investor, an angel, your customers, you choose it. In other words, they enter the growth story as the ones that are taking the risk and funding the future of where things are going. 

Now, back to the first aspect, the situation of being alone can be framed after the consideration that the entrepreneur side consists of a producing entity - that gets involved in the workings of something up to a point of presenting a proposal - seeking the investor entity, the side involved in financing the growth. The conclusion from this simplified frame is that a test happens at the moment that a proposal is presented and where a transaction is completed if the investor agrees on what is present and what is ahead. The situation of being alone, from a conceptual viewpoint, arises from the possibility that the entrepreneurial side might fail to capture the transaction, the investment, from the investor side. In other words, the producing entity is alone up to a point that supporters joins the boat. And the loneliness tend to continue, or in other words the team can be navigating in the same boat, as much as they can, and as much as they are able to do the test cycle again, and again.  

Yes, within the black box, the entrepreneurs have all sorts of possibilities of collaboration which aren't necessarily arbitrary movements of a lonely entity - such as to get involved in interactions and collaboration that could give them the opportunity to network their way up towards improving themselves, improving their methods, improving their vision, their process, their understanding of the market, and more. Still, the situation being that it starts small, that starts with uncertainty which is tied to the test necessity, reveals the loneliness of the entrepreneurial entity until further growth only valid in case the test is passed, which makes the boat to become larger and growth in complexity. Nevertheless, a new sort of black box is formed, again. And, again, an entity that is lonely and seeking another phase of growth situation which, again, depends on another test, and so on.

## Review

* ( ) Check if Maslow and the situation of the salesman wasn't already included in other chapter - "The notion for splitting the love" resonates with the view of the present salesman vs. future enlighted salesman which is pointed by Abraham Maslow in Maslow on Managenent. 

* ( ) Birdman is duplicated

* Consider the situation with Blitzscaling, p.289 and p.301 for the responsible Blitzscaling and requirement of Blitzscaling for the entrepreneur, which is to be an always learner, p.301, and also what Reid and Chris referred as paradox, p.301, which has to do with a need for estability and peace, which is a requirement which seems to aligh with diversity. 

* ( ) Consider learning ? Of Reid Hoffman?
