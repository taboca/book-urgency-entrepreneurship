* ( ) Anedoctal of Marcio - when Marcio had insight and told Michael that the major problem was of a party, for what was nice, like flow. And not the denial to do the boring. So the doing the so good things led to use of energy in excess.  Insigh of Marcio - Thank you Michael. Your reply resonated so much with things in my head, concerns, sometimes not clear; it adds so much clarity. A few months ago, I had, virtually speaking, screamed — ah! It's that freaking party the problem. The party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course). The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow. Insight of Michael, not a public quote, "Categorization --> clusters --> patterns --> priorities -- that's it exactly. Natural multi-taskers with a strong work ethic (that's what I hear in your opening above) can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them. That's a problem if you compound the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time. Thank you for the note. It's very helpful to see through your goggles." 

* ( ) Differentiate - 970_winnning.txt - The winning touches the aspect of growth but in fact it deals with the release of control in the face of the uncertain. This one deals with the identification of the investiment of the unit of energy, accounting time, respecting time.

## abstract 

* Abstract - Balancing Resources, such as Time Use, Starts with the Individual level and then it should apply to everyone involved. 

* Abstract - In the entrepreneurial journey, teams face the challenge of growth, or achieving growth at the team level and outcome leves. As they get into the track of execution, they find themselves unable to focus in things that are important but not urgent. These important but not urgent are usually things of another nature, they ask for reviewing, for reflecting, for reconsidering, for adapting. Such as to adpt to the future, to a market, to balance what is going on. Knowing that the key to entrepreneurial action is learning, and the learning after experimentation, the time inclination to leave the important to later connects with the fear of managing resources. Time to manage the basic unit of resource can be a waste of time - here it lies the complication. If no guide if offered, to the right steps, as in if steps can lead to later failures and after learnings, what would be the basic unit, or principle to honour? The human resource's time. Recognizing the value of each individual's energy and respecting their time is vital for effective management. Embracing the cyclical nature of the learning process and allowing room for experimentation, reflection, conceptualization, and application is essential for entrepreneurial success. Courage is key amid the tough choices, such as pressures, to move on with the equilibrium that is required by the entrepreneurial process. 

## SCqA v0.2 



* scqa - ( ) Subject - Entrepreneurship is growth. 
* scqa - (v2.3) Subject - Entrepreneurship and innovation involves risk and investing, of time and resources. At the earlier stages it's even more critical. Common sense indicates startup ability to pivot fast, as a plus. General idea of pivoting fast, and dynamics of the small team, seem to hide the reality of the chaos, even suggest it's okay to keep not being conscious about use of time. We will dive into reflecting for the basic unit of work, time. 

* scqa - Situation - Some entrepreneurs start with what seems to be vision. They dream of a new category of thing that can put a dent in the universe, like going to the moon or reinventing the way rockets can land.
* scqa - Situation - Other entrepreneurs start with other needs such as to make money, to have success, as in the money maker. By the way Ayn Rand constrasts the money maker with the money appropriator. 
* scqa - Situation - Others simply are pushed into a work, and they need to do that because, in a way, of money - such as paying the rent - but they are into that to grow, in a way to get out from whatever initial thing they are doing. 
* scqa - Situation - When they are in it for a startup, and as learning happens, as they try to assemble their ship as they sail, and they find major roadblocks and figure that the model seems wrong. 

* scqa - Complication - Not able to account, and respect, basic unit of learning and cycle of learning and creating abstrations after experimentation, experiential learning. Motivation, and color, we have no time to ask - how did I do? Reid Hoffman says that Brian cheeky asked that right in the first press event he did about Airbnb. For Reid, Brian is an infinite learner. Check Blitzscaling. Problem is lack of awareness about risk nature, innovation and entrepreneurship nature, nature of fast movements and big investing unit, scale of focus, cost of learning, nature of the matter from risk, and models that impacts, more complicated, learning cycle accounting.

* scqa - Q/a -  At the minimal level, of no guides can be offered, as it is likely that you can pick the right guide, aside from model, no model can be checked - what to do? Respect time. 
* scqa - Q/A - Insight and general line - The productive engine, which is natural, need, needs to depend on a reflective engine. There is no way. 
* scqa - Q/A - Intro to Key line - it does not matter if one is in it to make money or executing or coming from vision, the need to organize how to get things done is a pattern. It has to be done from inside out. It's quite rare that you can fix with superpowers that comes later unless you are sort of blessed with protection? That allows trying again and again. The general rule is learning that comes after failure. But the learning after failure implies in recognizing a cycle of investment. The basic unit of work, call it work ethic or else.


* scqa - Key 1 - How do we experience? - * situation - chaos, fail fail, learning, fail fast, pivot fast, ability to course correct, less inertia, the nature of startups, small teams, or an individual considering the project phase / Risk and bets are higher at the beginning, relatively - how we experience, warp, user innovation, paying rent, effort, motivation, romantic notions, or bets engaged like what? - Others were driven with that seem to be what Eric von Hippel referred as User Innovation. They all started with a problem they wanted to solve. That function seems to be quite alive, as anyone might "live through the challenges first-hand" that gives them a viewpoint for what can be different, motivation to seek answers, perhaps even their connection with the story is a supporting factor that makes them run through the stages when stages change. Perhaps they find the right cofounders too on their ways, exactly because of their identity with their goals, the general story that likely supports them. In other words, a good mission and one that is really into that, shows to be effective. Unfortunatelly, there is not a lot of data for the many that had great vision, really first-hand experience, and even time and energy, but failed to find the right pieces such as good cofounders, or that heard an impressive investor, and where warped into fading, diying slowly [^footnote_brian_pg_startsfade].

* scqa - Key 2 - Scaling models affects time reality -- capsules of models -  unconscious about unit of resources and investing bet, analysis of models of support, parallel realities.  -  Models do what? Framwork? Incubation? Tools, frameworks, traction with customers?  With some of these pathways being promising, but the entrepreneurs capsule having rudimentar setting and limited fuel. The willingness to find a solution in a new world, a given path of effort, pulls. Part of them want to visit planet X because of love, part of them seem to know that time is moving, that fuel is being used. The complication is that, new data comes their way, such as insights from the team about management of resources, they fail to manage the fuel of the critical energy unit, the human being and each individual. The answer to the problem lies in respecttime and to know that time is relative. Could, perhaps, connect with how entrepreneurial journeys start. Perhaps the idea of "I will make a startup" fits in a wider bucket, in the end of the day. Let's be honest, and for that we need to look at some of the patters of growth, in terms of organizations. Some startups start with the ideal to scale fast but then notice that the area/domain chosen might need some other strategy for that. In Blitzscaling, Reid and Chris bring about the fact, or the test, that are things that could indeed have a scaling nature. But then, what happens with the entrepreneur, the team, founders call it whatever you want that are into something and then out of the sudden comes to notive a big - oh, wait, I thought I was doing X with a Y model but reality is different. I thought I knew how relativity works. And the metaphor here, slightly implied, of an entrepreneur that dives in a space journey within a capsure warping hyperfast, sort of believing that she is strong and that the thin layer won't break, is in fact, when new worlds are ahead, going to come across such big waves and the real experience of being there, where time seems to move slow, but when they come back from these journeys, hopefully alive to experience and tell what has happened, they are then, to start that experience by first notice that time has moved too fast for whowever where down to earth. And then, sayings such as "I thought I was making a startup, that would have time to visit that planet and come back with a solution to people from Earth" but this mission, lazarous , somehoew brought me here, older and I hope wisier, to tell that reality is different. And I don't even know if I went there in the first palce to save the people from earth. Maybe I am just wanted to learn what is out there. We should keep annotated, that some of these astronauts do find interesting new worlds and ways to change reality of earth, and ways to impact people from earth. When that journey involves the right team, the right planet, and a lot of learning that helps them to assemble what they need, on the go, or when they get support from the beings of a higher dimension, yes, it seems to be amazing journey. Is what I hear from people that reported on the actual life journeys. 

* scqa - key 3 - Respect kolb, Respect the individual, and establish learning about self. Consider let it go and the post-mortem freedom of that. Respect time of team - and respect management. Consider team let it go and the post-mortem freedom of that. Respect time of investing and respect risk. Consider let it go and the post-mortem freedom of that. 

## Review - Fred 

* Fred brought a problem of "fathers" that pay people, that some of them are protected 
* Marcio wants to find something optimistic, that is good for everyone 
* Fabricio Morine talked about fazejamento, which is not enough 
* Maslow believed, after the summer in California, that companies could help people growth which is a sensitive subject as the demands of a manager/company culture might put the individual is a pressured condition of not able to walk through, such as to support pressure that touches on improvement areas in interms of psychological well-being, or endurance to some pressures such as artificialized pressure.  
* Seria interessante cobrir a questão de patrocínio, incubação, e zona de proteção. 
* A corrupção do tempo, que vem da gente. Quermos manipular, queremos controlar. Na próxima parte teremos a oportunidade de ver como que chefes permitem que seus subordinados usem tempo por fora, como que eles podem melhorar seus scores, abusando do tempo de cada recurso, na promsessa de promoções. 
* Removed whole confusing section at the end.
