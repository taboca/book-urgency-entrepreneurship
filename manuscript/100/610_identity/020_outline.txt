## Todo 

* ( ) Social Capital vs. Identity - "Our focus on particular identities can enrich our bonds and make us do many things for each other and can help to take us beyond our self-centered lives. The recent literature on 'social capital,' powerfully explored by Robert Putnam and others, has brought out clearly enough how an identity with others in the same social community can make the lives of all go much better in that community; a sense of belonging to a community is thus seen as a resource - like capital." (Sen, 2006, p.2) / Sen, A. (2006). Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny. W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.

* ( ) Social Capital - "The well-integrated community in which residents instinctively do absolutely wonderful things for each other with great immediacy and solidarity can be the very same community in which bricks are thrown through the windows of immigrants who move into the region from elsewhere. "   (Sen, 2006, p.2) / Sen, A. (2006). Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny. W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.

## Title 

* v0.2 - Identity 
* v0.1 - Driven by emotions 

## ScqA short 

* Pitch - If we depend on doing things because we love, connected with the goal for example, what if our love, or affairs, or attachments are barriers to ourselves when bad news chimes in? 

* Subject - Affected due to emotions of the founder role, value of role, leading to triggering action. 

* Situation - We wear a cape, we feel within that frame, driven by effort, or biased by values and passions with a cause or group's mission. We auto feed our identities, or a role, as a success metric, as in social capital.  We might depend on it too which drives results, actions. 

* Complication - We can't put down the cape, we can't drop the identity which seems to be needed.  

## SCqA expanded

* Subject - Emotions affect us, as organizations such as startups, start with founders. Emotions are triggers for value-systems, associated with who they are and their roles. 

* Situation - We make calls, we make mistakes - in the context of urgencies, pressures of judgments. We make trouble such as ends. And after post-mortem, we wished we could call us back in time. 

* Complication - The executor, as a person and their role, make decisions and emotions counts, chimes in, especially in front of projections of judges, or applaudes of the audience or representative of growth. Our aspirations, and who we think we are, make us feel, react, it influences our calls. It's tough to detach. 

* Key - How we experience - Our aspirations, in the beginning, counts more. Entrepreneurs depend on it - as this is where more value counts, such as motivations and vision & value system. We create value-anchors for who we are, for our causes, for who we ought to be so that we can have success. Thus we can be tied with the vision, or mission, or aspired state of founders. Then we fail, actually in fact after passing successes, thus we count on prior decisions, such as bets that yielded good advancements supporting our roles. 

* Key - Situations of value-based and emotion counts, as we attach to the roles that represents storied context - we hold things together and failing to represent might means breaking stability. Case of self (baby is ugly / steve) case of team tribe (melissa) and case of state (andy  grove on grief phases, and pre-mortem. )

* Key - Consider to bring in the case of Aaron, the caretakers company, and when hiring used a value system to add value to an employee, such as connection with cause, and goals. Then, of course, the fail day chimed in - technically speaking employee was judged - but now the CEO is victim of his identity "if I convinced company to hire with that connection, now that connection does not count? * Key - Distancing - Michael Dearing, Conscious BUsiness.

## Title 

Título: A resiliência emocional do empreendedor de sucesso
Título: As ideias e emoções do empreendedor em tempo real

## Notes 

I. Introdução

Empreender por necessidade pode ser desafiador
Incertezas trazem não apenas dificuldades econômicas, mas também emoções fortes que afetam o empreendedor e sua crença sobre empreender
Alguns empreendedores desistem e interrompem seus projetos, mas depois se veem livres e começam a organizar suas ideias
Empreendedores de sucesso conseguem separar emoções de ideias e vivem dentro e fora da bolha das adversidades
II. A relação entre ideias e emoções

Emoções afetam a performance e a capacidade de refletir de forma criativa
Nossa percepção determina nossas emoções e reações
Na vida, a ideia e emoção vêm separadamente
III. A resiliência dos empreendedores de sucesso

Empreendedores de sucesso carregam atributos de resiliência e tolerância às situações ambíguas
Vendedores e corretores são resilientes porque criam um espaço para trabalhar as ideias de forma isolada das emoções
Empreendedores precisam encontrar um caminho humanizado para trilhar um caminho que não seja desmotivante
IV. A abordagem humanizada para o empreendedorismo

A capacidade humana de sentir pelo outro pode ajudar os empreendedores a sintetizar suas ideias sem a confusão das emoções que só o protagonista sente
Exercitando nossas capacidades de observar, ouvir, refletir e opinar, podemos ajudar outros empreendedores com empatia e compaixão pelo problema, mas ao mesmo tempo sabemos que estamos fora do olho do furacão
Essa abordagem nos deixa mais arrojados e cria um modelo mental mais flexível

> "Founders is not a job, is a calling… this is not some job. The odds of you making money, in here; versus working at McDonalds, it’s a much better bet that you will be making more money in your career working at McDonalds. You need to do what you are doing because you love it, because you can’t think of anything better to do with your life. And if that is not the case, don’t do this because it’s going to be a miserable 10 or 20 years. If you are looking at getting rich like the Facebook boys, or the Google boys, or whatever the hot startup is now, that is the wrong reason to do it. If you are chasing the money, I will guarantee you, the more you chase it, the further away is goes."

Andy Grove, in the book Only the Paranoid Survive, talks about a situation when the leadership team develops an identity that is so strong that when a major change is happening the team feels the phases that are comparable with the grieve related to mourning — check the right words here.
