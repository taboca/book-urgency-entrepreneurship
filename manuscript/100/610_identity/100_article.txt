# Identity 

It seems to be that successful entrepreneurs are like professional artists, in the sense that they bring a vision to the world, that they have found an audience, being those users or a market or a group of people with the same needs, that they all feel in the same boat and share the same vision. In this situation, looking at their personalities or their character or their identities, they seem to respond accordingly, in other words, they do not fail to follow through, to continue to be professional, to please the audiences in  way, but not for the sake of pleasing, but in a way they comply with the audience expects, they are integral, and in doing that they seem quite well doing what is right under the higher-order goals they have, their vision, and what appears to be also a destiny even if they crafted their own - or in a way or another have gottin into it.

Some comparison with artists is an attempt to suggest that they navigate with the begginnings where a lot appears to be chaotic but as good artists they leave chaos, transcend, find something they are more tuned to, and which also goes along with the validation from audiences. Of course, all that connected with aspirations as they seek freedom and to access a change. 

We can consider that the true entrepreneur - or the true manager, or true worker - feels good about what they do as they live a relationship with what they do. The relationship with work through activities, not only connects with identity, as they see themselves, but also extends further that identity. This idea goes well with being human because work connects us with the world, through work we survive, through work we feel as somebody, through work we learn and grow; thus through work we can see ourselves acting in the world and as well we are seen by the world. This situation goes along with what is needed - not entirely due to work but likely supported by work - in terms of individual's self-realization which resonates with the humanized version of the relationship between work and the individual presented by Maslow [^maslow] (Maslow, 1998, p.1) which states that highly evolved individuals assimilate their work with their identities. In other words, work becomes part of the being that defines the individual.

[^maslow]: "These highly evolved individuals assimilate their work into their identity into their self, i.e., work actually becomes part of the self part of the individual's definition of himself."  Maslow (Maslow, 1998. p.1)

The identity of an entrepreneur, and in this sense that extends to the team, and spreads in a company, is created or developed by their own journey. In this sense, the formed identity is more than just something that by chance an entrepreneur, or team, develops as in the sense of discovering in such a way that it is validated, as a validated learning, which becomes stable at the moment of success. No, in fact the bigger issue about identity is that it is not found but created and even created by the very interactions with the external environment, obviously influenced by the founding entrepreneurs, obviously influenced by the vision. This is because entrepreneurship, especially in the case of startups seeking growth, depends on the environment for growth and in this sense the search for social capital is a large part of the process. And indeed, the dependence on the use of this social capital implies affiliations or agreements or affairs with groups that are understood as support entities but which become definers of the identity. In other words, the entrepreneur-founder or team depends on this support which more than perception is dependence in the sense of identity, that is, arises the complication of the entrepreneur or team that finds itself trapped in biased thoughts, in models that embraced them. As they think it is necessary, social capital, they cannot lose, or let go.

In the sections below we will start with the beginning where entrepreneurs, or the early team, are lonely but not lacking passion. We will recognize the initial movement of passion - that may come from a greater vision, or values sought, or even passions on top of effort or performance - that takes them to the forward movement of growth; and how their passions and motivations feeds their identity that sets them into what appears to be a destiny - that becomes their fuel that generally skyrockets - also shapes their behaviors to the point of being a risk to the growth situation and a source of concern for the gatekeepers of growth such as investors. Within the bubble of growth, we will look how these protagonists struggle through the interactions as they feel in realtime, as they climb through a ladder of affairs and associations with others, with the envinoment, that embraces them, supports them and may be also a source to feed their stronger identity as protagonists for good and bad things ahead. And finally, we end this reflection by lifting up us to the idea that we are not one identity and that we can try to transcend and embrace the work challenge situation as an opportunity to shift towards wider and challenging viewpoints, that transcending is recovering the humble spirit and that it is the source to change of our identities.

## Driven by vision 







Our aspirations, in the beginning, counts more. It's not really like a vision or the vision actually may have to do more with the clearing the way. But still, entrepreneurs depend on that thing. It is a value that counts, a motivation to act on a vision, a calling, the realization of a job to be done, you name it. We create value-anchors for who we are, for our causes, for who we ought to be so that we can have success. Thus we can be tied with the vision, or mission, or aspired state of founders. Then we fail, actually in fact after passing successes, thus we count on prior decisions, such as bets that yielded good advancements supporting our roles. This is where the mess starts. We are essentially babysiting ourselves. 

Andy Grove, in *Only the Paranoid Survive*, having considered the work situation - after all the entrepreneurial path moves towards work - had shifted from the vision idea towards the motivations:

The renowned Steve Blank, pioneer of the lean movement [^steveblanklean] and creator of the process titled Customer Discovery (2005), when interviewed about a single piece of advice for founders, revealed in the video interview:

> *"Founders is not a job, is a calling… this is not some job. The odds of you making money, in here; versus working at McDonalds, it’s a much better bet that you will be making more money in your career working at McDonalds. You need to do what you are doing because you love it, because you can’t think of anything better to do with your life. And if that is not the case, don’t do this because it’s going to be a miserable 10 or 20 years. If you are looking at getting rich like the Facebook boys, or the Google boys, or whatever the hot startup is now, that is the wrong reason to do it. If you are chasing the money, I will guarantee you, the more you chase it, the further away is goes."*

[^steveblanklean]: Steve Blank is a renowned entrepreneur and academic recognized for being one of the pioneers of the Lean Startup movement. Blank, along with Eric Ries, helped define and propagate the Lean Startup philosophy, which proposes the creation of companies and products under conditions of extreme uncertainty. His work, characterized by "customer development" and the idea of "get out of the building," is a fundamental pillar of this methodology. Blank emphasizes the importance of validated learning, iterative product development, and rapid response to customer needs as key principles for innovation in startups.

Thus, we can recognize that among cases of success and grand ideas, there are many inventions and innovations attributed to founders who found themselves involved in a struggle for a cause. However, there are also many entrepreneurs who, even without such a strong cause, still feel on a mission or are in the process of forming their identities. Embedded in Steve Blank's premise - that the call is necessary - is also the idea that in this call, the founder becomes a victim of the future projections they make regarding what they do, as well as a victim of the projected identity. This may seem exaggerated, but the actions tied to identity pressure occur daily and can manifest in simple things that would go unnoticed.

<!-- scqa: complication --> 

If any of this essence appears in the life of a worker, such as a worker that feels good about what they do, it may be even more apparent in the life of the entrepreneur as they are known to be more passionated, or more in love, with their activities. On the good side, we may recognize the kind of passion that - when taken by the stories of success - supports the execution of the successful entrepreneur to execute from visions, to engage teams, and to face challenging situations which depends on improved awareness, or conscious execution. On the bad side, although more effort has to be put in place as these stories are less shiny, the extremme reveals a passion that harms, that is of an obsessive nature, which can control the entrepreneur, which can prevent awareness, which can destroy teams, harms growth for the business, and important to say harms the well-being.

Thus, if the founder is a car and identity their road then passion might be the fuel that seems to appear to support the drive, or what drives us to accelerate. But while founders can put it in metaphorical terms, which can be quite innacurate or confusing, and while practitioners recognize that they can't do it without loving it, the concerns about passions and identity are greatly appreciated by the minds of others who happen to be there when behavior needs to be assessed, such as researchers and even investors, because the very same potential that fuel adds pressure, as well adds risk as one does act in front of the external world and under pressures, such as pressures of growth of a startup, which may force the result of a drive that can either go in harmony and bring opportunity or may on the other extremme  and driven by obsession cause destruction to the business needs of growth but also to the well-being of the entrepreneurs.  

Through the research by Bouizegarene et al. (2018), we might respect their intentions to explore how identity processes [^footnote_research_identity_processes] - the things we do that shape our identities - can have an effect in shaping on passions such as to become harmonious and obsessive, and if how that connects with the optimal functioning in society. 

[^footnote_research_identity_processes]: Identity processes refer to dynamics which individuals form, maintain, and develop their sense of self or identity. In the research of Bouizegarene et al. (2018) focuses in two types of identity processes, namely identity integration and identity styles. 

In other words, even if researchers go dig into the specifics and extremmes of driving with passion, their concern sets us to reflect on how we see ourselves, our roles, and how our sense of being in love with what we do  have an effect in our performance, which may sound good, but also on potential narrow views and perspectives.

Entrepreneurship is an activity that involves not only a commercial motivation but also a passion for a cause that one wishes to see changed. This motivation is central in the phenomenon of "User Innovation," where the entrepreneur finds themselves intrinsically linked to the cause they advocate. Both the work of Eric von Hippel in "Democratizing Innovation" (2005) and the course "User Innovation: A Path to Entrepreneurship" on MITx on edX emphasize this premise, highlighting that "innovation often starts with real people solving their own problems" (MIT, 2015). This concept encourages entrepreneurs to deeply engage with the causes they support, fueling both their passion and their motivation to create innovative and disruptive solutions.

As indicated in this video introduction to the course, inventions like basketball, braille, among others, and even technological solutions like Dropbox, were inventions that emerged from real need, or from pain points. In other words, personal causes. This premise, in the view of Eric von Hippel, is everywhere and is a phenomenon.

Let us first celebrate the intensity of passion that can take over the founding team. Entrepreneur, investor, and professor Steve Blank reported not believing that he was working in Silicon Valley and being paid to do what he would do for free (Blank, 2014) or that he might even pay to have the opportunity. This is not uncommon at some stage for entrepreneurs who find passions during their journeys. It happens when they stumble upon opportunities along the way — events that resonate with the entrepreneur's identity or that form a new identity. As the entrepreneur progresses on the journey of discovery and refinement, they better see the art being carved out of the stone and their identity — feeling like a deserving or rightful owner, or protagonist of the discovery, of what they saw, vision. That is, proud but also responsible, or the one carrying that flag.

Another point of view of Bill Draper, one of the early venture capitalists recognized as a founding fathers of Silicon Valley, supports us to see how entrepreneurs are likely to be involved with that they do in a holistic way: 

> *"Being an entrepreneur is very exciting and, as you know, just reading the papers, entrepreneurs around Silicon Valley here are buying the big houses and they're having a lot of fun. It's a lot of work, it's much harder work. I know, it's really hard work to be an entrepreneur, and it's the highest divorce rate in the country, and so you're taking some risks. But if you love what you're doing, and you will because it's your idea and you're pushing it, and for a while nobody's listening, but then eventually you get people to listen. The thing begins to grow, you begin to get proud, and like a little seed that the oak tree grows, and pretty soon you're taking a lot of the credit for what has been built [..] with your ideas and the people you selected in the beginning, but all of a sudden it's much bigger than you ever expected."* (Draper, 2017, 14:27-15:34)

--> 

This situation may likely appear as positive, as it seems to be fuel, which certainly is, especially in the beginning when resources are mainly about the team's time and where perseverance and ability to navigate the ambiguous space is a must. They need to be believers in the first place, and certainly if no passion or connection with the vision, if a lack of sense of place with the vision or current known mission, certainly would put the person to just sit there, like in a boring job but worse as they don't even get a compensation, like a payment. But if something drive us, on the positive side, when we see ourselves as in when we say "I would do this even for free," then the I, or this identity that feels compelled to do so, might be more or less passionated by the doing, which is about being able to detect that the activities being done produce a feeling of productivity, or safety, or of an alignment with a better future, and of a well-being.

### Investor's interest in passion

Now the concerns with passions influencing the drive is also recognized by the roles that are known as representatives of growth support in the startup growth situation - investors interested in growth. There are likely investors that may bet in passionated teams in a careless way, in a way, such as to a point of allowing them to move fast, with the knowing that potential flaws of passionated drivers will fall apart, as the growth process may take care of itself. In other words, the board can fire the driver later. And that view is not only real because many venture capitalist firms are pressured to grow fast, such as to conquer a given market aside from the means, where acceptable losses fits well the situation such as a founder that moves from a well-being state to a state of not being good to themselves and to the team, or the society. 

But as much as investors are interested in the benefits of passions, the cost of dealing with the negative side of passionated drives, especially when companies are growing, represents a major risk. Therefore, if a professional investor respect the benefits of passions - such as when the team had invested a lot in a domain, such as the team's expertise to make a product or service real - they do so with a risk-oriented mindset; in other words keeping an eye on the destructive force of founders who are enchanted, or too passionated, or in love, to a point of missing elements which are key for growth. In other words, they watch out for when founders tie themselves, such as when they put themselves at risk of disconnection the awareness that is needed to the next stage. This subject is complex precisely because the audience, like the market, is in the future and it is not known where things will go.

In Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital (Stanford, 2013), Howard Hartenbaum a general partner at August Capital, had seen enough interactions with founders to point that even founder's passions and expertise in a given domain - which he recognizes as must have - can become motivators for going full force instead of focusing in the homework and getting involved in checking aspects that could support to reduce the risk to the grow the business. He commented about a situation of a pitch given by founders that were attracted by an idea but missed a major flaw in the business model: 

> *"They didn't grasp the fatal flaw in their business model. This is a perfect example of 'they are gonna go into a space where they lack expertise other than finding it attractive,' they should have gone and found somebody who understood what are the challenges with that specific business, technically, market-wise, customer acquisition, LTV [life time value], all. For most businesses, there are enough similar or identical companies out there that you can learn from when starting a business."* - Howard Hartenbaum (Stanford, 2013, 17:21)

In this sense, the passions of entrepreneurs as seen by investors is also a subject of research, although it is certainly a challenge for researchers to understand the aspects of passions, or to find ways to assess the types of passions that determine more or less success in entrepreneurship. Yet, a window into this space is offered through the quantitative analysis by the research paper by Warnick, Murnieks, McMullen, and Brooks (Warnick, 2018,) which involved asking investors about the types of passions that capture the best investments. The approach in the research had considered the passion for entrepreneurship vs. passion for the product  [^footnote_research_passion_entrepreneurship_product], and its relevancy to investors, which are known traits assumed to be important if a team is interested in materializing innovation in the market. 

[^footnote_research_passion_entrepreneurship_product]: Passion for entrepreneurship have to do with when the founder is aware, interested, engaged, and feels good, with the various aspects involved in the execution the entrepreneurial activities. While passion for the product is oriented to the drive that is motivated by the vision of a product or service.

An interesting finding in the study help us to understand how investors operate with the growth orientation and using a risk analysis mindset, especially being interested in how founders are driven by passion and interested in knowing when passion is too much to the point of the expected growth. In other words, and because of the flipside of being driven passion can be a risk, they interest may related to the theme of openness to feedback. In other words, without such level of awareness a top-tier investor - such as a top-tier angel investor or a top-tier VC partner involved- might be concerned. Therefore, and if we were in the mood of  jumping to conclusions, one can consider that investors check first how passionate entrepreneurs are, and then, secondly or more qualitatively, how much they are open to feedback in ways that they give up their strict views or behaviors driven by passion, which would be an openness to release themselves from what they know. 

In other words, openness to feedback is a crucial element for investors to be able to help entrepreneurs to conquer their next steps. It follows from the research that blind passion, or unrestrained, can manifest as egocentrism, rigidity, or resistance; impacting the non-participation of investors. It is worth remembering that the role of the investor is the risk analyst of the business relationship with the external environment. In other words, a good investor is concerned about whether the entrepreneur is capable of listening to external feedback, as they know that the final word is from the market. Thus, the role of investors is also a test, a validation, which is compatible with the various other validations such as the market/customers, competition, etc.

It becomes clearer the view that entrepreneurship is science and art, which is born protagonized by entrepreneurs, passionate about art but equally passionate about science, who seek the balance of passions taking into account the connection with the environment where they produce and deliver their creations. Perhaps this formulation helps to explain the tendency of investors to trust more in teams of co-founders than in entrepreneurs who are alone, as probably, except for exceptions, solitary entrepreneurs are more intractable.

Worse is that often the crossroads has no signs — no warning. Steve Blank recounts the illustration of the entrepreneur who is enamored with their idea and does not listen to feedback from the outside world:

> [Colocar aqui a tradução da história do Steve Blank que está dentro do vídeo do map14 Melbourne]

Then it becomes apparent, not always at the critical moment, the rejection of the change of art, or change of one's role and identity — their role, their purpose (or how they see themselves, or how they assess their chances, their self-esteem and self-efficacy). The situation presented by Steve where "no one wants to hear that your baby is ugly" simply stems from the previously formed identity; as if the artist's discovery, even their own (still not revealed) put them in a state of euphoria, of anxiety, with an incredible, creative, and at the same time devastating energy potential.


In another exploration, the entrepreneur maintains the status of their previous discovery, the pre-planned line, even when they go to the streets with the goal of discovering more about the problem/solution, for example, when they go out to conduct research, like listening to their potential customers. The situation is — the entrepreneur returns from "fieldwork," opens the door, and says to their colleagues, "let's pivot!" claiming they heard the "feedback of the galaxies" because someone confirmed their theory, or maybe they were influenced by the pleasure of confirming some hypothesis, or the confirmation that the outlined work yielded positive results.

It's worth reflecting on the various ways this phenomenon presents itself, as it can be toxic, especially in the case of the entrepreneur. For example, a subordinate employee could easily observe this scene and imagine that the entrepreneur is indeed being responsible — after all, the president went to the streets, sought out data, is honoring the relationship with the user, the consumer, the client, with the outside world. He didn’t just create this in his mind. It conveys a strong but dangerous idea.

But probably this speed, this anxiety, or urgency characterizes the entrepreneur who is manipulating the data, or the interpretation of the data, is still reaffirming themselves and worse, believing so much in their own narrative to the point of trying to contaminate their collaborators - ah, the customers said the food needs more salt.

To better articulate this phenomenon, or syndrome, Steve Blank formulated the 72-Hour Rule: the founder is forbidden from returning from the streets and saying "let's pivot" for a period of 72 hours. After 72 hours, they reconsider what they heard.

### Humble identity






Perhaps for these individuals, the identity guiding them is further ahead, under construction, in the future; they do not throw themselves into, do not embrace so strongly the current state of the art, they are not anchored; the boat is free. When they allow this freedom, they can look at their crafts with a gentler gaze — they know they are in love with the current state but understand that the art consists of working on the art, sometimes leaving it behind, or perhaps letting the art be mediocritized by the world - it happens, and in cases, it can be good.


The subject to be considered is then that it is implied that they are in also in a quest to make the vision a reality, to bring to the world. But we still have to face the the problem of passion, and love, and how our leadership identity can affect our values and make us to make decisions such as decisions that take us in a bad direction. 

Thus, the situation that we now start involves the recognition of the problem, or complexity, of fusion, and deviations of the truth for a solution, or even being able to engage the performers, assuming the case makes sense, the escape hatch might exist in the very suggestion of the composer whose the job has to do with transcendence from the original artist that had discover to a a new artist that helps the early team to see the vision and support the growth, or the evolution of the vision. 

Is this the complication? - Thus, with that in mind we can find first a peaceful space that we must acknowledge that a lot from that "fusion reaction" is a heat that can also create confusion - there might be chaos in the growth which deserves the recognion that things might be shaky and which will affect the identity of the visionary as in might also create moments of "that is it, this is who I am," which is the very symption of a success but that can turn out to be condition that deserves a reflection as it might provoke the person into the situation of being a know-it-all or where the humble characterization ceases to exist in the face of what is next which is the actual necessity to grow. 

In a previous chapter, especifically in the section Infinite Apprentice, we have considered the advice from Brian Chesky and Reid Hoffman, the idea of the infinite learner, which brought up the challenges of a leader accross the growth stages. Brian reminded us that is not like one becoming more skilled in an art; and instead it has more to do with having to learn a new sport. Brian might be a good example that the infinite apprentice is connected with the an inner and humble spirit that enables transformation. For us, is a reminder to keep that fire on, the fire of being humble which opens the opportunity through the discovery phase, which they don't know fully yet how things are going to grow and how the realization will unfold. 

But what comes from the this space for transcendence is really about the vision for how the discovery can find its place, how it can growth, with a system in place, with the performers to support, and that idea necessarily involves the growth of the individual, the transcendence of the identity, towards the identity of the leader, or in the words of Steve Blank, the role of a composer. Steve Blank recognized that founders find a vision on their paths, they are carriers of a call as much as they are onto a call: 

<!--

--> 

> *"Founders fit the definition of a composer: they see something no one else does. And to help them create it from nothing, they surround themselves with world-class performers. This concept of creating something that few others see – and the reality distortion field necessary to recruit the team to build it – is at the heart of what startup founders do. It is a very different skill than science, engineering, or management. Entrepreneurial employees are the talented performers who hear the siren song of a founder’s vision. Joining a startup while it is still searching for a business model, they too see the promise of what can be and join the founder to bring the vision to life. Founders then put in play every skill which makes them unique – tenacity, passion, agility, rapid pivots, curiosity, learning and discovery, improvisation, ability to bring order out of chaos, resilience, leadership, a reality distortion field, and a relentless focus on execution – to lead the relentless process of refining their vision and making it a reality."* Blank, S. (2011, March 31).

Steve really touches the point of transcendence that embraces possibility, that unlocks the opportunity ahead, and supports the founders to not be trapped by any identity in a given moment, such as to be enamorated with an idea. 

What if, the thought could be turned into as "We are just starting" again. Perhaps that is a way to escape the negative side of the calling. This escape hatch opens the way for growth, for the full realization, and towards leadership. But it isn't easy to see from outside what we do. For that, we need to first acknowledge that it is important - first step - and then with spirit of a true entrepreneur - volunteering to learn - we step up into to find our answers. In a way, the entrepreneur is a generator of an art, it becomes the art in progress in itself, thus she needs to become the curator of its arts.

## Driven by social capital 








But then, all of this is great but we as entrepreneurs in our drive to deliver such development, we are driven to get into affairs with other groups, or entities, or even systems perceived as required to advance our journey. In reality, a solo founder may go seek to find a cofounder within a larger entrepreneurial or incubation entity that she had joined. Or an accelerator might be an opportunity. And there are all sorts of other entities that are dynamic, interactive, full of energy and showing alignment with the need of these founders. In other words, the possibility of affairs with external entities is not only evident of modern, networked, and rich ecosystem of entrepreneurship - where they will get from books to all sorts of supporting entities up to venture capital or other crowd supports -  but in fact realidily innevitable, as in difficult to avoid, as entrepreneurs understand they do seek, find, and acquire social capital. 

In other words, the formation of the founder's identity is not an outcome that is shown alltogether, along with the launch of the service or product - althought it is certainly visible through the launches as of course through launches and the limelight people can look and reflect about the identity - but in fact goes along with the modern approach of entrepreneurship where interactions with these entities happen along the way, which also goes well with the lean way of doing entrepreneurship. 

It comes from this growth with social capital that not only their identities are formed but are assumed as vital. When they find into it, they perceive as a value, and of course the implied challenge that values can't be taken. Thus, it may be so that they use time to not only seek and join these affairs but also nurture their identities and associations after all it is what protects them. 

And it does so, even so and so that they can also get into trouble. 

> *"Our focus on particular identities can enrich our bonds and make us do many things for each other and can help to take us beyond our self-centered lives. The recent literature on 'social capital,' powerfully explored by Robert Putnam and others, has brought out clearly enough how an identity with others in the same social community can make the lives of all go much better in that community; a sense of belonging to a community is thus seen as a resource - like capital." (Sen, 2006, p.2)

It may be important, therefore, to recognize that the formation, or support for an an identity, hasn't ties with product identity, such as ties associated with the vision. These ties also lies in self-efficacy, self performance, self-esteem, that they develop through the execution.

### Being tested by the judges of growth 






I wanted to write, the theme, about the emotions and judgements that can get into the way of the execution of projects. Start-ups, teams, and their constituents are people - they feel, they have emotions. We are also storytellers, and we make sense of what we do with narratives. And, we judge what we do, when we do it in realtime. It`s our natural ability. 

But the focus for this essay is about the life of an entrepreneur that wants to execute projects that demands progression. That is the situation for many. In that context, within this situation, this realm, the situation also has to do with one that seeks to innovate as one wants to break in a market, to call attention of potential users, buyers, stakeholders, partners, and more. 

Therefore, the entrepreneurial goal necessarily involves outcomes to that start-up, team, and one - the constituents -are interested in achieving. In other words, there is discovery. So it comes down to the art and science of progressing onto something that is not guaranteed. 

The complication, in the ocean of many complications, has ties with on one end, the excitement, the vision. Another angle, the expectations, associated with goals (or the outcome after goals). And, on the other hand, the realities in thw world of doing it. The execution with the results in the present will cause reactions from the individuals, which ar part of the teams. Tension comes in play, from the judgement, and analysis and trying to probe the ideas, the methods, the solutions, the market interest, and ones to help. And the jugment comes as narratives. As we have to tell ourselves how we are doing, tell others. We advance by telling. 

Consider the science and art of pitching, for example. When many say that knowing how to pitch matters, and many say, yes it matters. Marc Andreessen, 

```
I think the formal presentation is another test . . . As a founder, if you are not good enough at your job as a CEO, to get up and present, to institutional investors, for 60 minutes, and sell them on your thing . . .

We love when somebody walks in and has a compelling pitch so we can give them a check . . . that is a successful day for us.

In contrast, every other pitch you ever gonna make is going to somebody that is going to be much worse than us … Customers, they are going to be like — no, I am not going to give you any money — like their default position right? Engineers — you going to try to recruit engineers, and they got 20 other job offers, so why does your pitch is going to be much better than the other 20 startups? (Marc Andreessen at Startup School SV 2016, Y Combinator, 2016, 11:49)
```

The point here is that we are being judged by say "another point of view". In other words, judging ourselves all the time - all that we will do. When we craft a pitch, even before it is not shown to other, we do not even show and we read it as if we are a judge, an investors. Poor judgement right? It does not even have anything to do with the real outside world that, in the end of the day, it is going to read, to judge. 

Thus, it is up to us to keep track with methods that can support us to advance, to judge and judge it right, and judge in the right time. One theme in this theme is when to judge for execution of projects. Since a startup acts supposedly faster, things that really complicated as we are moving with specific tasks, when we are acting doing it. 

The focus here I am looking at is activities that be broken, generate poor results, as we judge in realtime. Knowing when to judge is a reflection that I invite you to engage here. And in this regard, we can get help from one of the area that is one of the most complicated fields that involves creativity and execution - an area that when judgement comes into the act of doing, writing. Two ideas, that explores the same point where our conscious judge gets in our way. The goal of these lessons is to spark in us a light, the light of control. 

<!-- taming the judge --> 

"Aiming for that, I learned to write setting judgment aside and save a polish for later. I canned this new, freer writing "laying track." For the first time I gave myself emotional permission to do rough drafts and for those rough drafts to be, well, rough. " - (Cameron, 1998, p. 19)

Now, another point of view for writing, from the Art of Non-fiction, is from Ayn Rand, the philosopher known for objectivism. She pointed that when writing, the act of engaging with editing when doing the first draft is a writing approach that leads to major complications, such as the conscious editor process that messes up with the subconscious that needs to write, to run smooth. 

Looking at the writing moment of a writer, and stages, seems to give us a view of how we manage our activities, micro management where a judge comes into our way before. Both, Julia and Ayn Rand, recommend using the judgement, of course. But the real point is when to call it. 

Julia Cameron added that for the situations that she was able to put her judge aside - "When I went back to polish, I found there wasn't that much to fix or change. A remarkable amount of my first-draft material withstood the test of later scrutinity. " (Cameron, 1998, p. 19)

Therefore, it comes the point for us to reflect, to consider, that we will need to separate progressing from judgement to avoid the drama in the point of view of Julia Cameron. Judgement in the way is never a good judgement and can be, indeed, a drama.

### Considerations about the atraction to identifications with representative identities 






It should, then, be considered, that the attachment with certain groups, or entities, and even frameworks and tools - which are by the way not only connected but also empowered by communities, therefore supported by social element which values social capital where the sense of identity is alive - can and will provide concrete values but along also the value of identity formation for the participant, and with that the implication of identity attachment, which in itself acts as value, therefore it becomes valued as the things we take that we cannot lose or that when under attack we may react to preserve which may become strongly than the general things perceived as necessary. And by that, as discussed, the attachment with such identity, or identities, may be assumed to be a source of greater value although which may not be true, just like a human may enjoy the perceived benefits of an inclusion in a given group but that does not give the final answer of who that person is, or better, who they are ought to become, and in fact may even harm that person's path as they represent, they act, they are directed in their reasoning, and directed in their decision, which may harm their self development path, their true aspirations, the formation of who they are to become. A supporting line to this general idea can be guided by the enlighted line of thinking of Amarthya Sen in Identity and Violence: 

> *"In our normal lives, we see ourselves as members of a variety of groups - we belong to all of them. A person's citizenship, residence, geographic origin, gender, class, politics, profession, employment, food habits, sports interestsm taste in music, social commitments, etc., make us members of a variety of groups. Each of these collectivities, to all of which this person simultaneously belongs, gives her a particular identity. None of them can be taken to be the person's only identity or singular membership category." (Sen, 2006, p.2)

## Driven by emotion






But if looking from above suggests the development of an identity, such as one that gets in the way a wider view, a stronger focus then must go for the actuall challenges of the day, as entrepreneurs do execute from the early stage and do not recognize that they deal with their identities. The reality of the day deals with the struggle where emotions happen and affect reasoning and decisions and even if it shapes entrepreneurial character it does so more silently without an alarm. 

We make calls, we make mistakes - in the context of urgencies, pressures of judgments. We make trouble such as ends. And after post-mortem, we wished we could call us back in time. Or to put in another way, when what we thought were right happen to become a trainwreck, and when all dies, and when we move onn. Suddenly it may be the case that light comes our way, as if the natural post-mortem, now not needed, happens within the space of total freedom, which is indeed enlightening and provokes one to think that "now that I solved all, I can't go back in time" and reason that "my belief was confusing me." They can only then achieve such new insights when they see what they did from a perspective such as a protected space where they can't anymore be in the control of the outcomes, such as when they lost the battle, they are now free from the psychological control. 

The complication is then, in the heat of all that happens, with no clear vision of any identities influencing, they can't separate these emotions, emotions that counts and chimes in, especially in front of projections of judges, and the pressure of time. So the question remains: can the successful entrepreneur separate emotions from ideas like someone who is inside and at the same time outside the hurricane? The answer is yes although it involes the recognition of tolerance for ambiguous situations such as abilities to live inside and outside the reality of what happens.

-->




In the battles of the learning and doing, the subject of the identities can be used so that we can reflect about these emotions that in the day drives but with no alarm given; supporting a must reflection as we are generally unable to pause to reflect on what we fell, why we feel, how we are reacting, and if our reaction can be driven by values, such as if emotions driving decisions are triggered from value-systems associated with who they are and their roles. 

According to Robert McKee [1], "In life, if you see a dead body in the street, you are hit by a wave of adrenaline: 'My God, he's dead!' Maybe you run away in fear. Later, when the emotions settle down, you may reflect on the meaning of the death of this stranger, your own mortality, and life under the shadow of death." The truth is that in the face of ups and downs we are emotionally affected because we are human, because we feel. For example, saying no, even to an unwanted type of client, is not so easy if the entrepreneur feels empathy and compassion. In other words, it is not just a simple question of suitability for the business.

When we feel emotions such as insecurity or fear in the situations we experience, we feel them because our brain is defending us: sometimes we even perceive risk situations as if we were being attacked — like trying to flee from a tiger. The idea of losing a client, or even a client meeting that didn't happen (the client needed to cancel), are day-to-day events for the entrepreneur that come in any form, as they are part of the adversities on the battlefield. Thus, our perception determines our emotions and reactions. If we are conditioned with the perception that losing a client is a threat, our brain can trigger an emergency routine and the emotions tallied may be too strong to the point of impacting our performance and our ability to, for example, reflect with the creativity that could eliminate problems.

For McKee, in life, idea and emotion come separately. This view can help us explain the liberating reflection that arises when a former entrepreneur gives up but as soon as they start a new job they can organize their ideas — oh, if they could make a call to their former self or go back in time.

According to Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha (2012), the real estate agent does not know when their next payment will come in because their job is based on highs and lows. So the agent works to sell but also on building their client network which is compatible with constant changes in daily life. It can be said that salespeople and brokers are resilient or even opportunistic. But we can look at the discipline that defines the survival conditions of brokers: they need to create a space to work on ideas isolated from the arrows of emotion, from the adversities of daily life. When the broker sells a big house, they are aware that they cannot be shaken for a longer time. What explains this resilience of sellers, in part, is a preconception inherent in the profession itself: sellers fly over, observe the environment, work in networks, and eventually dive to conquer their prizes. They do not categorize the work of the sale (the conquest of the prize) as being the greater work. For them, what is work is working on the network, flying over, navigating, observing, looking for new directions.

But the day-to-day life of an entrepreneur is different, for unfortunately, emotions do not come with a label that says “beware you are being charmed by emotions!” The reality is that we do not separate emotions from ideas precisely because we are human and because we learn to feel first. The truth is that our humanized version is proof that we were programmed to be occasionally lost.

The question that arises is the dilemma of being an entrepreneur versus being human. Is the successful entrepreneur less human since they manage to better navigate the day-to-day battle? Many become more experienced as they synthesize thoughts based on learning and in the face of daily adversities. And many seem to be more systematic or even colder after so many failures and successes. But these are perceptions that take into account the journey already traveled by those who have made it.

Now, in the field of battles and uncertainties, we need a humanized approach to tread a path that is not as demotivating as “ceasing to be human.”

This path exists thanks also to another human factor, just like feeling. It stems from our human capacity to feel for others. When we look outward, at someone else's problem, we feel, but we feel in a different way with empathy and compassion; very different from living as the protagonist. The humanized version for the entrepreneur is straightforward: we can help other entrepreneurs, especially those who are facing adversities. Even starting from the position of a listener, we are exercising our abilities to observe, listen, reflect, and opine. Moreover, we engage in a “together with them” manner with empathy and compassion for the problem but at the same time know that we are outside the eye of the storm. This approach helps us synthesize ideas without the confusion of emotions that only the protagonist feels. It becomes an exercise that makes us bolder, that creates a more flexible mental model, a perspective; not to mention the help we will be providing to others.

Every entrepreneur will undertake something with a goal or cause. We reach this stage because we want to change something in the world or achieve a better life. There are motivations and dreams, we already know that. But also, the moment we plant a seed in this terrain, we are not just waiting, but we are shaping our identities as entrepreneurs. So far, so good. The problem, the complication, is that we are in search of support.

Let's reflect on the need to regulate self-esteem, which is natural for people; but how the idea of regulating self-esteem is also tied to an identity that can be invented and is projected as being an identity in the future based on the expectation of success. And how engaging with this identity can lead the entrepreneur to fall into traps that will cost them time; and can actually help to destroy the real identity of the person, the experience, creating frustrations and lack of energy.

In this study, we will first address the case of Myanmar, in which a protagonist, after leaving prison, gains fame that triggers chaos in the nation. This example vividly illustrates how our environment can act as a catalyst in accelerating our identity. In an increasingly digital world, these phenomena occur more frequently and quickly, revealing an alternative reality shaped by the connections we establish and the narratives we create.


Next, we will delve into the implicit issue of identity in entrepreneurship. Through a reflection on this idea of entrepreneurial identity, we seek evidence that identity is not just a phenomenon, but also an essential premise for the act of undertaking. We will also explore the experiences of personalities in the industry, considering inherent risks to this process; that demands a higher degree of consciousness the more we move towards the entrepreneurial trajectory and develop a potential identity.

#### Challenging the superhero

As an example, we can consider the experience of Melissa Nightingale, who shared in her article, "Why it’s a Mistake to be a Startup Superhero" (2016), the danger of trying to be a "superhero" in a startup. During her journey, Melissa found herself so committed to her work that, on one particular night, she stayed in the office late into the night, waiting for colleagues who had been caught in a protest. She was available for any eventuality, whether a call, the need for bail, or the retrieval of equipment. So tired, she improvised a bed with large t-shirts and slept on the office floor.

However, she acknowledges that many of the actions and sacrifices she made, seen as heroic at the time, were not necessary. She was, in a way, a victim of her projected identity. Even if she had a valid belief that she were helping her friends, her colleagues, yet by focusing in that heroic identity she couldn't see that the were using herself as a resource, spending energy, which in the view from above were doing harm to her very colleagues and the whole organization. 

Melissa also highlights in her article how the startup space - she was inspired by the "high tech" space of startusp, encourages a blurring between work and social life. She wrote:  

> *"Tech is particularly good at creating the conditions that normalize this blurry line. Between booze in the office, drinks after work, offsites, outings, and all hands it can feel like a bunch of your social needs are well covered during working hours."* (Nightingale, M., 2016) 

This reinforces that beyond the issue of entrepreneurs' identity, there is also the element of social pressure. The need to be accepted, dedication to work, the feeling of belonging - all these factors can become inducers for one to engage in developing a professional identity, under the needs to perform too. Or it could be said that it goes beyond the necessary and ideal professional identity; but the sad reality is when we are trapped thinking it's a professional identity. It's a challenge to identify when investment in work becomes harmful, not only to us as individuals but also to our collective space, therefore harming collaboration. It is even possible that Melissa from the future would have a hard time to convince Melissa from the past in a call from the future as her past self were not sleeping much, resting as needed, reflecting as needed.

In the book "The Chaos Machine: How Social Networks Reprogrammed Our Mind and Our World," Max Fisher (2023) recounts the story of a monk named Wirathu, who was catapulted to fame in Myanmar after the country emerged from a long period of isolation and embraced the Internet and social media. Wirathu's rise and his ability to influence a newly connected nation illustrate the intricate relationship between connectivity, identity, and the potentially destructive power of an unchallenged alternate reality.

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* Reference - Fisher, M. (2023). A Máquina do Caos: Como as Redes Sociais Reprogramaram Nossa Mente e Nosso Mundo. Todavia.
--> 

Wirathu's story begins with a dark past, confined to an environment of hate during his imprisonment. However, his homeland, Myanmar, underwent significant transformations during his detention, including the widespread adoption of the Internet and social media, largely thanks to a partnership with the United States. Inspired by Silicon Valley leaders and former President Barack Obama, Myanmar made a rapid transition to the digital age.

As a result, the Internet - particularly platforms like Facebook and YouTube - became a stage for Wirathu to communicate with followers and increase his influence. According to Fisher, Wirathu enjoyed a popularity that propelled his communication with the world in a way that was unimaginable before the Internet era. Previously, he would have had to travel across the country to spread his words and gain followers.

On social media, however, Wirathu's words were amplified by the users themselves, driving a biased narrative. He "accused the Muslim minority in Myanmar of horrendous crimes, mixing rumors with fabrications" (Fisher, p.55, our translation), generating an alternate reality that became alarmingly mainstream thanks to his celebrity status.

Fisher highlights that the people of Myanmar were introduced to Facebook in an already developed state, creating a kind of digital explosion. Consequently, as users engaged with social media, they built or reinforced their identities. The popularity and echo within the support group became evidence of truth, fueling a confirmation bias that overlooked any counter-argument.

Therefore, users came to interpret the popularity of a post or figure like Wirathu as a validation of their beliefs and perceptions, strengthening their identity while simultaneously creating a cycle of bias confirmation that amplified the alternative narrative. In a notable episode, this dynamic culminated in violent attacks on the Muslim minority, motivated by information spread through social media.

Wirathu and Myanmar's case, as described by Fisher, highlights the power and danger of social media in a newly connected society. What were once unconfirmed fragments of beliefs became, in the digital age, mass validation of an alternative identity and narrative, providing users with a distorted sense of reality and morality. This illustrates the urgency of addressing the spread of misinformation and hatred on social media to ensure a safer and more inclusive digital future.

## Transcending 






Many successful entrepreneurs have created companies that have taken new directions and have indeed found happiness in this state of evolution. Not much needs to be said about this because everyone is entitled to live new passions. Moreover, it is not uncommon for art to become mediocre, but the artist is content with the new art once it meets the world. Perhaps this explains authors, like singers, who discover or stumble upon markets and are enchanted with their mediocre works, live moments of fame, live happily, and thus propagate their arts.

However, in this interaction with the world, in the confrontation with changes, the identity created by the entrepreneur also encounters discontentment when it does not evolve and may even die; thus it is perceived, felt, because the creator is co-responsible for their formed identity, their previous work. However, the situation of a major ship - such as of now a grown up startup living its corporate life - the movement or the encourter with what disrupts will provoke the positioning from the executive team and therefore the whole organization. They either embrace or lock the company as an event in time for a reflection.

#### Grown up ship 




As much as I hope that you are reading this book in the paper format, you may be reading it in a e-book device, or in your mobile device, or perhaps your e-dog is reading it to you (Dog: Start laughing joyfully and intensely, then gradually slow down your laughter until it fades away, mimicking the transition from being highly amused to becoming bored or slow.) 

It goes with that whatever electronic device you are using it now that you are using it directly or indirectly because of the evolution and work that Intel did - Intel the iconic Silicon Valley company worldwide known as a microprocessor manufacturer. 

Andy Grove, when going through his evolution as a CEO, had given to us great good reflections about the challenges of running a major ship when the waters start to change, when the winds start to change, the winds of competition. 

In this section we will bring the reflection by Andy Grove, the late CEO of Intel, that made an elaboration about the states of emotion of executives driving large organizations in a comparisong with the phases of grief. The recognition of the case of Andy about INtel's challenge to rehink the identity of the executive team, their position, and the theme that Andy brought where they were able to challenge themselves, himself and Gordon, the conversation in the office when they looked at the Great America ferriswheel. 

If we set our time machine to 1985, and land ourselves in the Ferris wheel of the Great America park in Santa Clara California, we would be able to point our binoculars to Intel's headquarters and witness that special conversation between Andy Grove and Gordon Moore, as documented in *Only The Paranoid Survive*, the conversation that marks a moment of transcendence from Intel management that took them to "The bold decision to commit Intel’s future to microprocessors," [^foonote_hbr_intel_1996] which brought Intel a major transformation to the world, that consumers get that Intel meant the computer's brains: 

[^foonote_hbr_intel_1996]: The article from HBR titled "Inside Intel" by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff (1996), underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of industry crises and technological shifts. In essence, the article considers Intel's journey through significant challenges, including the competitive pressure from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers in the mid-1980 which led to a strategic pivot from memory chips to microprocessors, and how the success from transformation brings new challenges, like a totally new game or sport where the organization has to transcend in order to survive.  

> *"I remember a time in the middle of 1985, after this aimless wandering had been going on for almost a year. I was in my office with Intel's chairman and CEO, Gordon Moore, and we were discussing our quandary. Our mood was downbeat. I looked out the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon and asked, 'If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?' Gordon answered without hesitation, 'He would get us out of memories.' I stared at him, numb, then said, "Why shouldn't you and I walk out the door, come back and do it ourselves?'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 89)

In my view, a lot of these activities are motivated by the need of senior management to occupy themselves respectably with something that clearly and legitimately requires their attention day in and day out, something that they can justify spending their time on and make progress in instead of figuring out how to cope with an impeding, strategic, destructive force."*  (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 124-125)

> *"At such times, senior managers often involve themselves in feverish charitable fundraising, a lot of outside board activities  or pet projects. Take a look at a representative calendar of the CEO of a major corporation that was in the middle of a strategic inflection point (page 126). Does his allocation of time, his most precious resource, reflect the strategic crisis? I don't think so."*  (Grove, A., 1999, p. 125)

Andy Grove, in Only the Paranoid Survive (1999), explains a critical situation - he had referred as an strategic inflection point - that can be experienced by leadership teams of large companies. This inflection point is when a stabilized company, which has a product or service well established in the market, encounters a force that disrupts the equilibrium of the product or service. Most companies experiencing inflection points simply do not survive because the acting forces impacts them brutally. One can imagine the entity-company, on the sunny beach, when the waves start to change but the tsunami that is coming is not perceived. In these moments, sometimes decades before the tsunami, management teams experience sensations as difficult as those people feel when they loss a loved one — such as to defend their positions, to deny the early signs. 

> *"If you are a senior manager, you probably got to where you are because you have devoted a large portion of your life to your trade, to your industry and to your company. In many instances, your personal identity is inseparable from your lifework. So, when your business gets into serious difficulties, in spite of the best attempts of business schools and management training courses to make you a rational analyzer of data, objective analysis will take second seat to personal and emotional reactions almost every time."* (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 123-124)

> *"A manager in a business that's undergoing a strategic inflection point is likely to experience a variation of the well-known stages of what individuals go through when dealing with a serious loss. This is not surprising, because the early stages of a strategic inflection point are fraught with loss - loss of your company's preeminence in the industry, of its identity, of a sense of control of your company's destiny, of job security and, perhaps the most wrenching, the loss of being affiliated with a winner. However, unlike the accepted model of the sequence of emotions associated with grief (i.e., denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, ultimately, acceptance), in the case of a strategic inflection point, the sequence goes more as follows: denial, escape or diversion and, finally, acceptance and pertinent action."* (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 123-124)

Both in the journey of the inflection point of large corporations and in the journey of the younger venture, it is up to the entrepreneur or the leadership team to work in the pursuit of truth and not in the reaffirmation of the current state of the art. In this sense, courage is important because good leaders are those who also put themselves to the test, allowing themselves to be in a position of vulnerability that is liberating.

After all, no one wants to be caught off guard by a tsunami, whether due to customer dissatisfaction or external forces such as competition, changes in market rules, etc.

When Patrick Collison was invited to talk about his fast-growing company at the Technology-enabled Blitzscaling classes, instructor John Lilly pointed out that “he walked in with a book made of paper, which is always very exciting.” Further down the interview, John wonders why he has so much interest in history.

For Patrick, it’s a way to cheat. Everyone else ignores all the good ideas from history, and so you can just be much smarter by just, you know — you could just try to think all these incredibly original thoughts by sort of sitting down and staring at the wall for days on end — or you can sort of cheat by just, you know, I mean they are, in fact, written down in books that you can just read. (Patrick Collison — Greylock Partners, 2015, 11:17)

Patrick’s point almost passed without myself noticing what is so special. But it turns out that I was reading an amazing history book - The Power Makers, by historian Maury Klein - at the time, which helped me to reflect and consider why entrepreneurs should read about history such as history of technology, history of entrepreneurs, and more. 

When great historians drag us back in time, they help us better understand how factors, such as the external environment, such as period and the cultural environment, have an effect in entrepreneur’s decisions and goals. It’s like you are transported into the protagonists but also giving the protection so that you are not lost like a protagonist. The protection is the space of opportunity to reflect about the currents of the time, the factors influencing, challenges, and more. 

It provoke us into questioning things like what brings us to come up with ideas? Is it pain? Or love? Or a major obstacle on their way? Is it a vision or an epiphany, after he had long years of thinking and living through challenges first-hand? What made them pursue a life of entrepreneurship? what factors contributes for us to persevere for decades?

Connecting the dots leading to innovation. The view from above, or from the cockpit with a narrator using the time capsule, might also give us the view of hot the dots are connected, for how inventors bring their ideas to market: from the background, to how the idea first appeared, moving to how they evolved into an early product, showing the potential pitfalls or how ideas are brought to the market.

It’s like a view from the above that conciliates how external factors are influential to entrepreneurship. What pitfalls we can find? What obstacles appears in front of us? What are the conditions that can favor the further development of our goals? Will the environment be friendly in the short, medium and long run?

It’s great to learn about successes. But historians will also tell you about the failures; and more, the failures of first movers, such as the life and death of inventors and entrepreneurs that could not bring their ideas as they have envisioned, and the potential later realization, by others, of what those first movers had envisioned. This level of contrast help entrepreneurs to better understand a macro view for how inventors and inventions correlate and collaborate in the long run and the leadership compoment that mad things to become real. 

Consider the situation of John Fitch which is credited as one of the inventors of the commercial steamboat service. His product, Perseverance, was launched in 1790 as a commercial steamboat service but didn't do well and was abandoned. 15 years later, as history shows, a successfully implemented solution was brought by Robert Fulton, that was a bit less inventor and more of an assembler and able to focus on the service. 
 
> *“Fitch advertised the service heavily and the boat performed admirably — going five hundred miles before suffering mechanical problems — but the passengers did not come. In desperation, the partners offered free food and drinks on board, but every voyage continued to lose money. What had proven to be technological triumph turned out to be a commercial failure, and the service was abandoned after that first summer. His investors backed away, and Fitch eventually found himself nearly penniless once again.”* (Klein, 2009, p. 46)

Reading how amazing inventions were born helps us soften our minds and better recognize how much biased we are, how humble we should be. Consider the situation of Ampere and Coulomb which were convicted about the lack of relationship between electricity and magnetism, leading to the general acceptance that no relationship existed between these areas. Such belief persisted for about 20 years, when suddenly however an unknown professor hits a discovery by chance: It was during an experiment with his students when professor Oersted were melting wires and noticed that a compass moved every time the electricity was being turned on/off.

After such discovery Oersted published a paper. While Ampere priorly did not believe in such relationship, this was a real experiment, therefore easy to replicate. From that moment, Ampere not only accepted but he immediately started contributing to this new field in a matter of two months.

In the above passage, new opportunities appeared after that irrefutable observation of effects of the physical world, enabling the status-quo of scientists to be dropped quickly. They other words, they had to accept change as their environment was changing. 

Productizing an idea depends on many factors such as vision and engineering capacity. But it won’t necessarily mean your target customer is ready to accept the proposed and envisioned product. And even if they are, it does not mean that all the forces in the future will favor your product to enter and sustain itself in the market.

### Considerations on changing goggles 





For closing, we shall consider the very situation of growth for the business, or the need for growth, that can be used as a way to shock-aborb any potential interpretations and characterization of how founders are conducting. The experimentation, or exercise, of transcending and doing analysis of the business for the future, which will likely set the theme of tops-down needs, taken from vision and higher-order goals, objectives, which will embrace the development of the business, may be a good exercise to put the present execution under a degree of scrutinity.

For Michael Dearing, lecturer and investor at Harrison Metal, founders should evaluate themselves and understand the differences between coming up with an insight, developing a product, and developing a whole business:

> *"First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to, hopefully God willing, turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)
