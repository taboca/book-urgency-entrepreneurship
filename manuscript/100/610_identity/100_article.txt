# Identity 


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outlinne - Pitch - To be concerned with the identity, not objective, they think. But an identity is formed from a role, and can offer risk the very moment when they become. 
--> 





Why bother with the identity of the being that carries out the work of entrepreneurship? It might be considered a waste of time.  Maybe I we could even say that, in general, entrepreneurs identify themselves as people who care more about their objectives than about who they are - their identities. But then they grow and they get to be listened - even to be interviewed about themselves beyond what they do and to tell how they are, their characteristics, as entrepreneurs, and to even talk about their personalities. They then might, at last, identify themselves as entrepreneurs; although after the fact, in hindsight. 

You are now invited to consider the what happens with the life of the doer that does it - the cycle of entrepreneuership - as they become - indeed their best selves - but essentially discoverying their someone new, if not someone else. And in alignment with our concerns in this book, we shall set ourselves to look at the development of an identity, and to be concerned with the possibility that what they become to hinder the path of their startups; especially given the growth situation of startups - as we saw in the previous chapter - where each stage is not just a harder step but a whole new unknown sport.

![They start with passions but they shape themselves as doers](images/100/strip-identity.png)



No artists start with the fully knowing that they are artists. Like entrepreneurs or writers, although they seem to recognize a half door open to them, unclear to tell in the beginning tough. Brian Chesky of Airbnb [^footnote_brianchesky] acknowledged that - in hindsight - the only entrepreneur he knew was Bob from Bob's pizza [^footnote_brianchesky_bob]. But like artists, entrepreneurs seem to identify themselves as sort of doers and learners that takes them into it, into becoming. Some of that goes well with the insight from Steve Blank, given in the prior chapter, as he considered that entrepreneurs didn't born as entrepreneuers, and that entrepreneurship can be taught for the ones that passionately want to become one, in the first place, but that are ones that see themselves as protagonists, that besides the willingness to learn are into doing it, executing it. 

[^footnote_brianchesky]: Co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, Brian Chesky has become a leading figure in the tech industry, particularly within the sharing economy. Under his leadership, Airbnb has transformed from a simple idea of renting out air mattresses in a living room to a global platform offering unique accommodations and experiences. 

[^footnote_brianchesky_bob]: In his talk on Blitzscaling, Brian Chesky mentioned Bob from Bob's Pizza as an example of an entrepreneur. https://youtu.be/W608u6sBFpo?si=MHVkBijl9I5DpAfC&t=99

In other words, while in the beginning they generally can't tell who they are - if generally are not interested to discusss - they seem to recognize or identify themselves with personalities or the characterizations of entrepreneurs, after the fact. But if it seems to be like a revelation, certainly given in retrospect, it is certain one spoken of as not one made of an arbitrary movement. In other words, while they claim they couldn't connect the dots, they do recognize their passions, or motivations, or that actual movements they trusted had to do with leading them into it - into becoming - as eloquently put by Steve Jobs in his speech at Stanford: 

> *"Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later."* (Jobs, Steve, 2005)

* Complication - #Identity #Change #lock - The journey, from chaos to clarity, demands change for success. But also that change define us, and can impact too in the challenging path.  
--> 








Now, from that journey, and by assuming a certain stage of achievement, it may help us to understand other implications of themselves discovering themselves as entrepreneurs. As noted, they might have changed and transcended or learned - from the experiences and even from failures - and by now they have a more clear relationship with their craft. For some of them, it could be that they think that what they do is really their destiny. Or even if we can't go that far, they may still think that they have discovered, in a way or another, theirselves as protagonists of the entrepreneurial craft on their hands, or as a kind of personality responsible for for what is now happening, or what it is now working, or for keeping up with the dots now connected. 

And while they are not yet concerned with themselves as entrepreneurs - likely because they didn't yet hit a major mark as succerssful or failure to a point of being interviwed about who they are such as their personalities - this is a point when they more intensively, or more consciously, respond to what is ahead by being who they now are. And since a lot of the good benefits of that awareness is taken care or spoken elloquently by too many stories of success, we shall set ourselves to look at the possibility of an identity that responds too in negative ways. In other words, when an identity embraced and formed by its own merits, becomes a potential source of complications that sets challenges.

A3 - Growth - Driven by emotions while doing it - the struggles from within the bubble, put the story in perspective.

--> 







Let us be concerned with the realization that we embrace a quite beautiful being that can do magic but how that consciousness and trust becomes the very element that prevents one to into transcending it, to change ourselves, such as to creatively destroy ourselves. With the sections below, we will start our reflection by looking at the journey of the self that is starts the movement with passion and motivations. Looking from the holistic view of growth - which indeed starts with the sparks from a particular vision, or from strong values, or even passion from performing, or great ambitions - we will reflect about how their initial system of passions and motivations, and aspirations and valuess, are key drivers taking them into becoming or embracing styles and how that can be challenging. Then we focus within their bubbles, so that we can witness themselves caught in what they think is a path of growth, and in what gives them the status of protagonists, to reflect on the struggle through the interactions and feelings that happens in realtime as they climb through a ladder of affairs and associations with the environment that feeds them for good or bad. Then we come back to the reflection outside their bubbles, to consider how we can break it and challenge the perceptions about our roles; where a better destiny is to embrace ourselves as the whole that lives multiple identities.

















## Driven by vision

<!--
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Pitch - A vision for who we are doing it? It can't be normal vision [feat. AG] 
--> 






Let us assume that entrepreneurs, like artists, are following a vision. But I don't mean that kind of vision where one would be a followed of something envisioned as if they could commit to implementing the dots - as if they could get the dots that comes after the fact. I thankful for the analogies with artists because it helped me to shift away from that notion - as that is certainly not what artists do - is an idea I better consolidated when I read from Adam Grant, in Originals that Da Vinci had done about 1200 drawings, to name an example. 

Let us assume a vision for how we see ourselves bringing ourselves into something that we might be onto it which we don't fully know of. Therefore, here and for us and far from the limelights, it might be a vision for a startup being executed by the self or the self executing a startup. 

At least I find comfort using that viewpoint because there are many that start *that* other kind of vision but then are caught doing it and doing it happily while their original vision has vanished. Another reason to set that typical vision aside was given by Andy Grove in *High Output Management* when he said that vision is a lofty word: 

> *""* (Grove, A., 1999, p. xxx)

@meta @outline 
* Outline - Situation - Calling [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 








But even if a static vision is not there, and if we envision ourselves doing it, yet we are not into it in any arbitrary way. This is about the right moment to invite the viewpoint from an entrepreneur, an investor, a professor of innovaton and entrepreneurship, a praticioner in the field of startups and known for having originated the the lean startup movement - Steve Blank [^steveblanklean]. 

[^steveblanklean]: Steve Blank is a renowned entrepreneur and academic recognized for being one of the pioneers of the Lean Startup movement. Blank, along with Eric Ries, helped define and propagate the Lean Startup philosophy, which proposes the creation of companies and products under conditions of extreme uncertainty. His work, characterized by "customer development" and the idea of "get out of the building," is a fundamental pillar of this methodology. Blank emphasizes the importance of validated learning, iterative product development, and rapid response to customer needs as key principles for innovation in startups.

When asked to give a single piece of advice for founders, he had given first his perspective with the notion that being a founder is not a job as we know it. He had reported not believing that he was working in Silicon Valley and being paid to do what he would do for free (Blank, 2014) or that he might even pay to have the opportunity. If that notion is a bit not so normal to many people, we still have to agree that it gotta have something - as in to be driven by passions - to that that initial thing going, what keeps the gas tank full for the the journey where the odds are against, to climb the pyramid or the ladder, to go towards the expected situation of growth, or success, or one, but starting from zero: 

> *"Founders is not a job, is a calling... This is not some job. The odds of you making money... versus working at McDonalds, it’s a much better bet that you will be making more money in your career working at McDonalds. You need to do what you are doing because you love it, because you can’t think of anything better to do with your life. And if that is not the case, don’t do this because it’s going to be a miserable 10 or 20 years. If you are looking at getting rich like the Facebook boys, or the Google boys, or whatever the hot startup is now, that is the wrong reason to do it. If you are chasing the money, I will guarantee you, the more you chase it, the further away is goes."* (Blank, 2014, 34:33)

--> 

What I like about Steve's view is suits the range of entrepreneurial situations. The calling does justice as it explains the initial movement and because it includes quite well the actual entrepreneur in the story. It helps me to focus on that other kind of vision - a vision for how we see ourselves, as protagonists, that sets us to do it.

Now, as for the matter of money - and althought Steve is right in the idea that money is not generally the outcome - these doers do recognize money as a function within, or like a key element of measure for the success of their calling. To see money in perspective, consider the relative importance of money given by the Andy Grove's reflection from the work situation in High Output Management:

> *"Money has significance at all levels of Maslow's motivation hierarchy. As noted earlier, a person needs money to buy food, housing, and insurance policies, which are part of his physiological and safety/security needs. As one moves up the need hierarchy, money begins to mean something else - a measure of one's worth in a competitive environment. Earlier I have described a simple test that can be applied to determine the role money plays for someone. If the *absolute* amount of raise in salary is important, that person is probably motivated by physiological or safety security needs. If the *relative* amount of a raise - what he got compared to others - is the important issue, that person is likely to be motivated by self-actualization, because money here is a measure, not a necessity."* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 213)

Now, in the entrepreneurship situation, money gets a special place that might be even greater, or impactful to their path, in comparison with a situation of one that seeks money. In other words, modern entrepreneurs, young or experienced, will listen to money as they recognize its potential. In the view from Michael Dearing, what have unleashed entrepreneurship, especially during the industrial revolution, involved the disconnect from the money people from the ideas people from the management people. Consider an illustration of basically an investing situation way before the rise of venture capital, when the Brown Family (the money people) essentially became investors the Slater's Mill (the idea people) around end of 1700 and early 1800: 

> *"The people who put up the capital for Slater's Mill were the Brown family of Providence, the people after whom Brown University was named. This was a family that made their fortune in the slave trade and then the textile business. And then had no clue how to mechanize their spinning operations. Slater was the embodiment of somebody who had the technical skill and inventiveness, ideas mostly which he stole from the UK, and they were able to pair together in a way that wouldn't have been possible previously."* (Dearing, Michael, 2015)

In other words, no strict vision for something ahead exist and no strict outcome for money exists. But a vision exists that setthemselves into the doing it, be it because of love, passions, motivations, aspirations or you name it. Each individual might hold a mix that explains their calling - but certain it is a vision where they see themselves as managers that are responsible for orchestrating what it takes, the elements for growth, like the managemenent of money ( from customers or investors ) and the management for how to use ideas.

This vision might help us to understand the space where we become - from the ones not being able to connect the dots first - the ones that eventually can tell where they are going, to explain the calling, to in retrospect explain the vision. In other words, the doing sets us into the becoming it, into turning out to be entrepreneurs, and likely living a certain identity which could show in different ways - the one responsible for acting in certain ways, the one responding to what is expected, the one that respecting certain models of thinking, or of organization, such as to respect the presence of a potential investor, such as to respect the presence of a potential customer, and more. In other words, this opportunity space of growth, and living, has a potential to match with the views from Abraham Maslow from when he was invited to reflect about the work situation during a summer at Non-linear Systems in California, when he said that "These highly evolved individuals assimilate their work into their identity into their self, i.e., work actually becomes part of the self part of the individual's definition of himself." (1998. p.1)

<!--

* @todo - p1 (Done) - In Identity - Maslow and identity developed by work -  It might be worth it to point that Maslow indicator for the development of an identity in the work place could be challenged with the simple idea that people live a life beyond work. I think that Maslow's point has to be seen under the context in time that people used to be a lot in the same work space and under the isolated observation that there are situations which is likely to be the case, due to the points given such as when the work or team embraces the person. @meta-refid 1233-1234-4567-0987

--> 



Now, granted, the view considered in the reflection from Maslow is not a provocation for us to consider the whole individual as defined by what they do in work situations or entrepreneurial. Naturally, the situation of entrepreneurship can't be the whole environment of living, or of social interactions, that may either promote the development of the self. But the provocation is outstanding in the sense of there are situations of work of individials where they get involved with behaviors that takes them into shaping personalities, such as a personality that holds values, that stand to their responsibilities given that they become protagonists and have something to lose. 

This space, becomes a space of self growth in a way. That it is a way of living it, of a worker or a professional identity, or an  entrepreneur, that essentially becomes a stage where they move up through ladder of needs [^footnote_maslow_needs_hierarchy], that given the phisiological needs satisfied, for example that the work pays health insurance, that the work is safe, and that a compensation enables the person to sustain a healthy life; and given a work that also brings psychological safety, where people are welcome to be themselves, where their creativivity can flowrish, where they are not pressured to be who they aren't, and given that the environment of colleagueship exists, and given that the work supports them all to work in harmonious ways, then it would be acceptable that a self development may be promoted in a way by this healthy work environment. And one way to enter that path of groth is to actually become, to embrace an identity.

[^footnote_maslow_needs_hierarchy]: The concept of human needs for motivation and development has been explored from both psychological and business perspectives. Abraham Maslow first introduced the hierarchy of needs in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" published in the Psychological Review, proposing a pyramid structure of human needs from physiological to self-actualization. Andy Grove, in his book "High Output Management," recognized the employees' basic needs as a foundation for higher productivity and self-actualization within the workplace.

* Complication - That the journey is not a journey of discovery of their performers, such as existing. It may be a journey of shaping, shaped by performing and influneced by dynamic passions and motivations. 
--> 







Now, having us shifted away from the idea of an existing vision as a main driver of entrepreneurship, and having set some ideas for how we are essentially living a calling, we shall set outselves to accept a more dynamic view of events helps to shape the entrepreneur during the journey and the possibility that their identities are then shaped by the activities of the journey. 

And the regulation of their behaviors it's something to be a concern. As they are the protagonists for following their vision - such as to be executors from passions and motivations, they can't enter the reasoning and reflecting from the wider view about the possibilities that who they become can be eventually a trap. In other words, they become performers. In other words, they actually access the idea that they are sort of following a pre-existing vision. In other words, they're accessing and executing the idea that they are discovering their best selves for doing something. The complication is that they can't have time, or interest, such as to consider that they are shaped by the very specific interactions with groups and models happening in front of them. In a way, they identity themselves with the sort of roles that disregards that very consideration as futile or useless. That kind of position, or mentality, might be part of an embraced mentality. Normally, and in the heat of the execution in the future of fast-paced work mentality, we find no reason to rain and ruin on our own parade, to mess up with the very idea that gives us the strength to make everything such as the impossible possible. In other words, if these individual doers are laying tracks, and if any harassing happens to happen to them occasionally, much of it happens to self-enforce what works for them. All that goes along with the fast-paced culture of executing based on learnings in retrospect, which is generally a great idea if we think of the doer as a performer. 

The only problem is that it may not the case for entrepreneurs, because the succcessful management of the self, as a discipline, would in ideal terms require them to be more like conductors. And an example of a problem is the general culture of the doer that tries to identify their best strengths and only focus on best strengths, such as by doing psychological tests as if they're playing with themselves at the founder level, the entrepreneur level, as they would, for example, if they really need a specialist profile for a specific need in their company.

By pausing and reflecting about these aspects, we can gain an improved awareness about the entrepreneurial journey as formed by the personalities and characters and identities of entrepreneurs. In the next sections, we're going to consider two viewpoints. The first from the entrepreneur side, considering that they can be in passion with these aspects that can set them to be too involved in the process or enamorated with the idea or focusing too much on the product side, the passions that can set them in a specific direction miss the whole growth curve. And then the other viewpoint from the vision of the investors or the gatekeepers of growth, which are equally concerned about the behaviors of founders and teams, their identities. And as much as they appreciate their passion, they know that can be a fuel to bring them harm, can prevent the whole business into the growth situation due to obsessions, such as that can cause destruction to the business and the growth situations, if not the well-being of entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurs might feel productive or happy or good with the things they do through the journey, the job steps [^footnote_jtbd_jobsteps] of their startup's journey. They may just do well the work of "determining their goals and plan resources," or they enjoy to "Gather items and information needed to do the job," or like to "Set up the environment to do the job," or appreciate to "Verify that they’re ready to perform the job," or smile that they can "Carry out the job,", or have fun when they "Assess whether the job is being successfully executed", or are proud to "Make alterations to improve execution," or they worship when they "Finish the job or prepare to repeat it."

[^footnote_jtbd_jobsteps]: The Job Map by Strategyn (2024) says that all kinds of jobs have 8 steps. From that fundamental thinking I got inspired to think about the job of making a startup, or the job of a team seeking to innovate by making a company.

By our involvement with that calling into the job to be done, the job of growth, we essentially set ourselves in a a context where productivity matters and we get into the evaluation of ourselves and into assessing our identities as entrepreneurs; which sets in attitudes, behaviours, our ways into processes, or towards being matured in a way, by the - or multiplied - by the confirmations from the feedback that we get after the actions we had executed. We will essentially be proud of some style, or the approaches, or the sort of decisions we make when things seem to give signs of positive results across the range of activities. This consciousness of what works can set us to love ourselves as the doers. Let us consider situations to reflect on how we can be rewarding ourselves as we move through the ladder of an entrepreneurial journey.

#### A knight and the holy quest  



Consider the following, given by Andrew Chen from A16Z, for *How to Break into Silicon Valley*, where he had shared a perspective that can support entrepreneurs to achieve productive conversations as they network. The following is optimistic in nature which is self-evident; so rather ask you to read the excerpt by focusing on the aspect that he calls for a higher degree of awareness about one's style, or considerably characteristics for a dynamic in the face of entrepreneurial needs in the ladder:  

> *That said, the conversations are more productive when you have “a thing.” What I mean by that is that all of these conversations and networking are more useful when you are starting a company, creating a new podcast, are working on a new project or book, or something else. When you have a directed goal in mind, then the conversations often are more valuable for all parties involved, because you were making yourself an expert in a particular area and your questions are more relevant. Otherwise you will surely encounter very busy people who simply refuse to “grab coffee” to “catch up” because it’s a poor use of time. 
> 
> I encourage you to be on a quest of your own, and even better a particularly interesting quest, so that your conversations with people can be as productive as possible. In my case, I was very interested in the state of the art on growing users, metrics, network effects, and marketing. I asked everyone about this topic, and began to develop my own ideas that I would share freely. Eventually, it became clear that a few small communities orienting the PayPal mafia were the furthest along in their thinking. And that’s how I ended up being exposed first to concepts like retention curves, DAU/MAU, viral loops, and so on.
>  
> These ideas were interest to me, because my professional experience leading up to that point was actually an adtech. I had previously worked in online ads, with customers from WSJ, CBS, MySpace, etc, and had even gotten a patent filed on ad targeting (yes, US7747676B1). I had a superpower in my domain knowledge of CAC, A/B testing, funnel optimization, lead gen, etc, and began to merge all of this thinking with consumer products. In 2007 this was cutting edge at a time when product success was often measured by vanity metrics such as the total registrations for a product. This bit of specialized knowledge was what I brought to the table, and I talked about some of those learnings and ideas, and how they might apply to products. Sometimes I’d get intros to interesting people simply because of this expertise, which I appreciated."*

The illustration of Andrew, although not precisely story of an founder, shows a situation that is entrepreneurial in nature and how we get into affairs to be concerned with ourselves as conductors. Consider how the illustration establishes a role of a conductor that values navigating through networks, how it values certain networks such as the ecosystem of the valley; Oreven the aspects that we are to be, or are essentially testing outselves, moving through the ladder. This might well be an example of a practical advice that is coherent for a protagonist that is into the growth situation of a startup. Wait, I can do that too and wait I might have indeed something great to talk about. Maybe I should be too obvious seeking for money in the normal ways I had done it. Maybe I could jump to networking by having interesting conversations about the things I do that are really interesting, my own quest. And then as he or she does it, and if works, they might finally move from a half door open to being in a room.

#### The aspiring founder 









When I joined an accelerator program in 2016 I had a badge labeled "empresário." That is the thing that a Brazilian would fill in a form to describe their title - as the responsible that runs a tax-paying business entity. In addition, I was also an entrepreneur. And secretly I saw myself as a sort of artist. And not secretly although trying to hide at that time I was a software developer. And out of curiosity I had other titles such as Web Master from back in the good old days when the movie Jurrassic Park came out. And now I just remembered that being a Web Master brought me to become a Web Developer  [^footnote_marciogalli_webdevelopers]. 

[^footnote_marciogalli_webdevelopers]: In *The History of Web Developers Tied to Browser Development* (2023), I had had the opportunity to reflect about the emergence of the role known as the "web developer." That the environment, the emergence of browsers, have helped to shape the role. It seems to be, as we see people working, that the craft shapes them, to a certain degree. This may be the be observable in some corporate situations, like the corporations from the west from the late 1900s to and early 2000s. And it is likely what makes the perception of performance - assuming that their colleagues understand them, that their colleagues trust them, that they predict what they do and how they do - as much it makes them to create impactful outcomes - good or bad.

Before the event they requested the "bio," which is basically a short story so that they can introduce the speaker. I gave them the bio thing but followed by my name, my current title, and the name of my company. But as the limelight turned on I was surprised to be introduced as "Marcio, an aspiring founder." I can't say I loved it because the first thing that went through my head was "Where is my bio thing?" 

But like my colleagues being *accelerated*, I felt a pressure that I weren't there to be worried about that title or my title. The startup in the future needed the founder in the present - it seemed to be what they expected from me, to focus in being an aspiring founder. To point another moment of a story about being concerned about who to be, I recall the day that most of us had watched a lecture and I pointed to the lecturer that the homework we had to do, given by the rule book, seemed to be misleading us into a wrong outcome. The lecturer and program advisor had responded to me saying that "this is not an university," to brought a group of aspiring founders in the back to laugh strongly before they even noticed anything. I confess I was frustrated, under that pressure that seemed to be asking me to be more pragmatic or perhaps a true "aspiring founder." 

It didn't happened at the time but now I wonder how that supporting line may have supported a lot of the others into that they were just doing it right - such as by not asking questions, such as to be accelerated. Still, yet another reflection I hope about the fact that the system, the space, the stage, might be one that expects from us; might be one that sets examples for who we should be. It may too set us into becoming it, even without noticing or pausnig like I did being lost or too reflective about my worries about my identity.

A situation illustrated by Steve Blank helps to see how we are evaluating ourselves bu executing based on expectations such as from the outstanding situation. The illustration considers the problems of a startup that sets a founder to do fieldwork but then does so poorly. The challenging point of complication is depicted by Steve Blank:

> *"let's pivot!let's pivot!let's pivot!let's pivot!let's pivot!let's pivot!"* 

In order to help teams to see themselves outside their bubble, Steve Blank has formulated what he calls the "72-hour rule," where the founder has to be forbidden to say "let's pivot" for a period of 72 hours from after they come from outside the builting with a great feedback. Now, we shall consider a number of scenarios where the advice of Steve could me helpful. One could be that the founder is obsessive with an idea, as in enamorared under the indicated situation of "no one wants to hear that your baby is ugly." Or, on the other hand, the founder could be enamorated with the process now that she was prompted to "get out from the building" and prompted to and check in the face of the prior or more poorer situation. It could even be the case that the team was sick of working on ideas without any data; that they could not stand being executors of theoretical ideas. 

So, if on one hand Steve's rule helps with an awakening, to whoever were listening to the "let's pivot!," on the other hand it also awakens us to the possibility of styles that are embraced by the individual - such as the founder enamorated with an idea not willing to go out from the building, the founder pressured by the team to go out and get anything real, or the situation of one focusing on being an executor of the process. The key point of reflection is to consider that the us as individuals in the heat of doing it might well embraced styles that can be analoguous to following heuristics - essentially embracing and operating by mental shortcuts that are expected of a role that is a projected role likely designed, aimed, expected.

#### Being passionated with the potential of the doer

Recovering our theme, we are yet in the context of when things start, looking at the characteristics of the individuals that forms the startup and how that impacts the future of their startup. We can recap that the parties involved might be onto a vision or a calling or you name it but anyway interested in making a new reality. We have also moved away from that idea of a prior vision which would involve a priourly formed identity of these doers. Thus, we had set ourselves to face that the growth ladder of startups as offering lot of elements that influences the doers, their character, their identities as entrepreneurs. 

And into that, that the realm of passions or motivations - and the things we value - are not limited to the things we do, like our objectives or ideas aimed. Thus, that our passions and motivations are certainly linked to what we think are our most precious resource - the generative engine of the startup - the team. In other words, exactly because we measure our most precious resources, we find ourselves into embracing the outter set of styles, the outer set of characteristics of others doers, from other personalities. 

In other words, how we shape own identities  can be a concern for the the growth of the startup, and then for the gatekeepers of growth, like investors, which we will consider next - how investors sees entrepreneur's passions influencing their road.

### Investor's love and hate for passions 



In a previous chapter, especifically in the section Infinite Apprentice, we have considered the advice from Brian Chesky and Reid Hoffman, the idea of the infinite learner, which brought up the challenges of a leader accross the growth stages. Brian reminded us that is not like one becoming more skilled in an art; and instead it has more to do with having to learn a new sport. Brian, therefore, might be a good example that the infinite apprentice is connected with the an inner and humble spirit that enables transformation.

But then by recognizing the situation of Brian, we should take in the consideration the context too, to force ourselves to recognize what he had revealed too about the network of knowledge and learning how to learn - the idea of accessing the best books would be an element - either people or by great books. 

Also the location and timing - that he and his cofounders were in a space that were considered top-tier, YCombinator, and the eventual connection with Reid Hoffman too. Now notice the complexity as Brian and his team moved up the ladder - having entered YCombinator - and the point where they recognized that YC almost didn't invest.

Another point of view of Bill Draper, one of the early venture capitalists recognized as a founding fathers of Silicon Valley, supports us to see how entrepreneurs are likely to be involved with that they do in a holistic way: 

> *"Being an entrepreneur is very exciting and, as you know, just reading the papers, entrepreneurs around Silicon Valley here are buying the big houses and they're having a lot of fun. It's a lot of work, it's much harder work. I know, it's really hard work to be an entrepreneur, and it's the highest divorce rate in the country, and so you're taking some risks. But if you love what you're doing, and you will because it's your idea and you're pushing it, and for a while nobody's listening, but then eventually you get people to listen. The thing begins to grow, you begin to get proud, and like a little seed that the oak tree grows, and pretty soon you're taking a lot of the credit for what has been built [..] with your ideas and the people you selected in the beginning, but all of a sudden it's much bigger than you ever expected."* (Draper, 2017, 14:27-15:34)

--> 

if we reverse engineer the life cycle by the view given by Bill Draper, it is then inescapable the situation of the journey that started with apparently nothing when no one was listening to them, but later, by the very growth and success achieved, it goes with the logic that people started to listen, and they are therefore involved in that conversation and their performance and now living and interacting with a lot more people who recognize them as successful and so which brings them to believe in their beliefs.

This situation, under the consideration of being positive, make us to think of their fuel, which certainly is especially in the beginning the resource such the founder's time and motivation or the early team's time and energy that keeps them to persevere and navigate the ambiguous and uncertain space ahead. They need to be believers in the first place, and certainly if no passion or connection with factors like a vision - or a mission or a purpose - certainly wouldn't set them to move and would keep them to consider that they are in a boring job and even worse as they don't even get a compensation like a payment. 

But when the situation - as indicated by the "I would do this even for free"  - comes our way, it is then that the early confirmation of our realization that the activities being done produce a feeling of productivity, or safety, or an alignment with a better future, and of a well-being.

Now the concerns with passions influencing the drive is also recognized by the roles that are known as representatives of growth support in the startup growth situation - investors interested in growth. There are likely investors that may bet in passionated teams in a careless way, in a way, such as to a point of allowing them to move fast, with the knowing that potential flaws of passionated drivers will fall apart, as the growth process may take care of itself. In other words, the board can fire the driver later. And that view is not only real because many venture capitalist firms are pressured to grow fast, such as to conquer a given market aside from the means, where acceptable losses fits well the situation such as a founder that moves from a well-being state to a state of not being good to themselves and to the team, or the society. 

But as much as investors are interested in the benefits of passions, the cost of dealing with the negative side of passionated drives, especially when companies are growing, represents a major risk. Therefore, if a professional investor respect the benefits of passions - such as when the team had invested a lot in a domain, such as the team's expertise to make a product or service real - they do so with a risk-oriented mindset; in other words keeping an eye on the destructive force of founders who are enchanted, or too passionated, or in love, to a point of missing elements which are key for growth. In other words, they watch out for when founders tie themselves, such as when they put themselves at risk of disconnection the awareness that is needed to the next stage. This subject is complex precisely because the audience, like the market, is in the future and it is not known where things will go.

In Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital (Stanford, 2013), Howard Hartenbaum a general partner at August Capital, had seen enough interactions with founders to point that even founder's passions and expertise in a given domain - which he recognizes as must have - can become motivators for going full force instead of focusing in the homework and getting involved in checking aspects that could support to reduce the risk to the grow the business. He commented about a situation of a pitch given by founders that were attracted by an idea but missed a major flaw in the business model: 

> *"They didn't grasp the fatal flaw in their business model. This is a perfect example of 'they are gonna go into a space where they lack expertise other than finding it attractive,' they should have gone and found somebody who understood what are the challenges with that specific business, technically, market-wise, customer acquisition, LTV [life time value], all. For most businesses, there are enough similar or identical companies out there that you can learn from when starting a business."* - Howard Hartenbaum (Stanford, 2013, 17:21)

In this sense, the passions of entrepreneurs as seen by investors is also a subject of research, although it is certainly a challenge for researchers to understand the aspects of passions, or to find ways to assess the types of passions that determine more or less success in entrepreneurship. Yet, a window into this space is offered through the quantitative analysis by the research paper by Warnick, Murnieks, McMullen, and Brooks (Warnick, 2018,) which involved asking investors about the types of passions that capture the best investments. The approach in the research had considered the passion for entrepreneurship vs. passion for the product  [^footnote_research_passion_entrepreneurship_product], and its relevancy to investors, which are known traits assumed to be important if a team is interested in materializing innovation in the market. 

[^footnote_research_passion_entrepreneurship_product]: Passion for entrepreneurship have to do with when the founder is aware, interested, engaged, and feels good, with the various aspects involved in the execution the entrepreneurial activities. While passion for the product is oriented to the drive that is motivated by the vision of a product or service. 






Through the research by Bouizegarene et al. (2018), we might respect their intentions to explore how identity processes [^footnote_research_identity_processes] - the things we do that shape our identities - can have an effect in shaping on passions such as to become harmonious and obsessive, and if how that connects with the optimal functioning in society. 

[^footnote_research_identity_processes]: Identity processes refer to dynamics which individuals form, maintain, and develop their sense of self or identity. In the research of Bouizegarene et al. (2018) focuses in two types of identity processes, namely identity integration and identity styles. 

In other words, even if researchers go dig into the specifics and extremmes of driving with passion, their concern sets us to reflect on how we see ourselves, our roles, and how our sense of being in love with what we do  have an effect in our performance, which may sound good, but also on potential narrow views and perspectives.

#### Are they listeners?


An interesting finding in the study help us to understand how investors operate with the growth orientation and using a risk analysis mindset, especially being interested in how founders are driven by passion and interested in knowing when passion is too much to the point of the expected growth. In other words, and because of the flipside of being driven passion can be a risk, they interest may related to the theme of openness to feedback. In other words, without such level of awareness a top-tier investor - such as a top-tier angel investor or a top-tier VC partner involved- might be concerned. Therefore, and if we were in the mood of  jumping to conclusions, one can consider that investors check first how passionate entrepreneurs are, and then, secondly or more qualitatively, how much they are open to feedback in ways that they give up their strict views or behaviors driven by passion, which would be an openness to release themselves from what they know. 

In other words, openness to feedback is a crucial element for investors to be able to help entrepreneurs to conquer their next steps. It follows from the research that blind passion, or unrestrained, can manifest as egocentrism, rigidity, or resistance; impacting the non-participation of investors. It is worth remembering that the role of the investor is the risk analyst of the business relationship with the external environment. In other words, a good investor is concerned about whether the entrepreneur is capable of listening to external feedback, as they know that the final word is from the market, or investors, or other gatekeepers of the growth curve. Thus, the role of investors is also a test, a validation, which is compatible with the various other validations such as the market/customers, competition, etc.

It becomes clearer the view that entrepreneurship is science and art, which is born protagonized by entrepreneurs, passionate about art but equally passionate about science, who seek the balance of passions taking into account the connection with the environment where they produce and deliver their creations. Perhaps this formulation helps to explain the tendency of investors to trust more in teams of co-founders than in entrepreneurs who are alone, as probably, except for exceptions, solitary entrepreneurs are more intractable.

## Driven by social capital 






The considerations that we have given so far was an invitation to the idea that there is a holistic journey in any entrepreneurial effort allows us to connect the dots for who we are - or to discover our best self. Embodied in that journey, it is then set the consideration that are are activelly coordinating the right protagonist to operate in the given environment ahead of us; that we are activelly testing ourselves and that we are doing so in the face of an audience - expected, implied, or real, or artificial. 

Of course, all of that makes sense as we feel the feedback that by embracing behaviors we become a better tool for the objective ahead. In other words, we get to embrace a better protagonist that can take the startup to the next level. But let us continue to consider how we so naturally respond to the challenges ahead by seamlessly forming a protagonist, and how it is difficult to surrender that protagonist when needed - especially given that we are strongly driven by the ties with groups such as colleagues, customers, mentors, advisors, and other voices, even from systems, or rule books. 










<!--
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Social Capital - Situation - Introducing Social Capital. 
--> 







Let us start this reflection with an illustration for how the environment actively invites the doer to embrace a personality. Consider a local accelerator as a partner that exists to challenge, to motivate, to educate to a certain degree, but also to take the founding team into a stage of more potential. Some of the accelerator programs, such as early stages, can start with the situation which they recognize as a place to start. For example, consider one that asks the team to come up with three ideas and to select their best for an upcoming pitch, which is basically a short presentation event where they present in front of judges that in a way represent investor's or the gatekeepers of what is next. And even if what happens at this stage can be considered  artificial, like a selection process based on ideas and communication, it isn't as perceived by the participants due to the actual outcome possibility - that however passes in front of the judges are likely in a position of visibility and to actually get into a more realistic condition of success. In other words, the participants know and feel that that participation, and potential winning, takes them to a step further. No matter for them how artificial something is - it matters more that they can be in a more real situation for the growth. 

In one of the situations that I had participated, I recall from the early feedback I had collected before the pitch that one of my ideas had produced increased level of growth in the pupils of some of the local mentors. The idea had to do with a way for Brazilians to split the bill of a pub more easily. But after my own considerations, I had decided to move on with some other idea - of a slides platform or yet another slides platform, the idea that didn't produce any excitement in the early feedback. Long story short, my pitch didn't do well, the presentation didn't ring any bell or convinced the local judges of its potential. So I got a bad grade and even an assignment - a homework not to say a punishment - that was basically about a chance to get back on track or to be out. But a limited number of others did pass with good scores and stronger claps. One thing I have noticed tough, that in the hurry of things happening I seemed to be back into a certain position, like of a learner or apprentice. And on the other hand, the winners seemed to be in a different stage, as in of being matured in a way. At the moment and given the stages of that situation, it really felt that they moved from beings that wore that "aspiring founder" badge into other category of beings like "pitch winner team" approved by that Silicon-valley-based accelerator program. 

In retrospect, having considered the feeling of us as protagonists moving up and down that ladder of growth, it became clear how strong and impactful it can be when we interact with these players - or representatives or promoters of the growth ahead. In a way, they get to be the resources we so much want to have with us. That I sort of knew, we knew, especially if we consider that we are beings onto something, and focusing on the objectives first. But what I couldn't see at the time was really how these social interactions had the potential to set out the expected set of behaviors from us - an idea I had seen better after having read the following quote from Amarthya Sen in *Identity and Violence - the illusion of destiny*: 

> *"Our focus on particular identities can enrich our bonds and make us do many things for each other and can help to take us beyond our self-centered lives. The recent literature on 'social capital,' powerfully explored by Robert Putnam and others, has brought out clearly enough how an identity with others in the same social community can make the lives of all go much better in that community; a sense of belonging to a community is thus seen as a resource - like capital."* (Sen, 2006, p.2) 

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* reference - Sen, A. (2006). Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny. W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.
--> 

With that it comes the implication that as entrepreneurs seek and acquire social capital and equally are materializing who they are. In other words, the formation of the founder's identity is slow - as it is not launched out of the sudden as if it is a super hero's identity launched with the product launch - althought it is generally visible through these moments or milestones, like big launches or when the limelight appears and the photos are taken and where all sorts of eyes may be then interested to looking at their situation from various perspectives such as to reflect about founder's identity, and their personalities. But in fact the identity formation goes along with the modern approach of entrepreneurship where interactions with entities happen along the way, which also goes well with the lean way of doing entrepreneurship where a lot more happens and where a potential growth ladder exists, even if it is artificial in a way, up to the point it appears to be real, be it real or not.

### Feeling what happens 


Having us considered the idea that founders might embrace personalities as a result of the environment - and that they migth do so under the pressure of what they expect of themselves - I now invite you to reflect about the challenges in the day to day as their perspectives and consequently their decisions can result from who they become. 

Let us go back to Steve Blank's ideas that characterizes a successful founder as one that has to do it because they love and not as a job. Assuming that personality, we may then consider that the characteristic of resillience is present- that he or she should likely more open to the sporadic downs. Another situation that resilience can be inferred from the characteristic of the role is the case of a real stage agent since they are okay with the knowing that the next paycheck is sporadic. In The Start-Up of you, Ben and Reid call our attention to a built-in dynamics of this role:

> *"The real estate agent doesn't know when his next paycheck is coming in. He has ups and downs. He has to hustle to build a network of clients and keep up with changes in the market. His income is humpy, and sporadic big wins (selling a multi-million dollar home) keep him alive."* (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2012, p. 188)

--> 

Now, while there many characterizations of a role rises to the surface - such as of a real estate agent that can be resilience - a further dive into their domain can take us to realize that essentially they become performers as a result of what they expect for their survival. In other words, how a professional real estate agent reacts to the loss of a big sale is different from an arbitrary beginner that takes the job without prior training or advice. We may goes along the managerial notion that the later lacks maturity for that task [^footnote_andygrove_taskrelevant_maturity], that such beginner then suffers more, or struggles more in the face of receiving the no from the first interaction. Along with that, it follows that we think that the beginner can trained and that support and advice is suitable if given by experienced professionals in the field; and that such advice shall help them to be okay with the ups and downs or to be comfortable with receiving the no from prospect, as an examples. 

[^footnote_andygrove_taskrelevant_maturity]: Andy Grove in High Output Management provides an insightful perspective that what we do, and how we perform, is tied to the maturity level for a task. He had mapped levels from low maturity which requires more guidance, to higher degree of maturity where guidance can be strategic.

But that idea of maturity linked to the tasks hasn't anything to do with one's capacity to see things from perspective. These are essentially different worlds. In other words, an expert in a complex field can essentially operate by instints too, for example an experienced real estate agent that instinstively is matured to support a no from a prospect.  

Furthermore, and to make things more complex, anyone living the situation of a role in the field is likely to feel pressured to react given the circunstances that may call a personality to rise. Consider the following illustration from Robert McKee for how the human can be called and how its rise can be observed by the instincts that sets in: 

> *"In life, if you see a dead body in the street, you are hit by a wave of adrenaline: 'My God, he's dead!' Maybe you run away in fear. Later, when the emotions settle down, you may reflect on the meaning of the death of this stranger, your own mortality, and life under the shadow of death."* (McKee, xxxx)

The illustration from McKee properly invite us to consider that we engage and disengage from that certain human personality, or how a set of instincts can be applicable to be operationalized by the situation and also by the role that we expect of ourselves in the moment. In other words, while a paramedic still feels what that normal human being felt, she will likely be able to control herself. In other words, the instincs of the basic human in the paramedic are silenced given a specific set of mental shortchuts that can be governing that role assuming that the paramedic is well trained to dynamics of the task and the situation. On in other words, the instints of the paramedics are different when they are in paramedic mode. 

But too, given the illustration of McKee, we are then invited to celebrate the position that we can look at ourselves, such as when we consider "my beliefs" of the past, and with that that we can see characters in third person. Let us then trust that capacity and consider the situations of others which naturally follows from our ability to feel but from distance - empathy. This approach helps us synthesize ideas without the confusion of emotions that only the protagonist feels. It becomes an exercise that makes us bolder, that creates a more flexible mental model, a perspective.

#### Challenging the superhero





As an example, we can consider the experience of Melissa Nightingale, who shared in her article, "Why it’s a Mistake to be a Startup Superhero" (2016), the danger of trying to be a "superhero" in a startup. During her journey, Melissa found herself so committed to her work that, on one particular night, she stayed in the office late into the night, waiting for colleagues who had been caught in a protest. She was available for any eventuality, whether a call, the need for bail, or the retrieval of equipment. So tired, she improvised a bed with large t-shirts and slept on the office floor.

However, she acknowledges that many of the actions and sacrifices she made, seen as heroic at the time, were not necessary. She was, in a way, a victim of her projected identity. Even if she had a valid belief that she were helping her friends, her colleagues, yet by focusing in that heroic identity she couldn't see that the were using herself as a resource, spending energy, which in the view from above were doing harm to her very colleagues and the whole organization. 

Melissa also highlights in her article how the startup space - she was inspired by the "high tech" space of startusp, encourages a blurring between work and social life. She wrote:  

> *"Tech is particularly good at creating the conditions that normalize this blurry line. Between booze in the office, drinks after work, offsites, outings, and all hands it can feel like a bunch of your social needs are well covered during working hours."* (Nightingale, M., 2016) 

This reinforces the idea that an entrepreneurs' identity is formed by its relationships and the social pressure. The need to be accepted, dedication to work, the feeling of belonging - all these factors can become inducers for one to engage in developing a professional identity, under the needs to perform too. Or it could be said that it goes beyond the necessary and ideal professional identity; but the sad reality is when we are trapped thinking it's a professional identity. It's a challenge to identify when investment in work becomes harmful, not only to us as individuals but also to our collective space, therefore harming collaboration. It is even possible that Melissa from the future would have a hard time to convince Melissa from the past in a call from the future as her past self were really living that personality. COnsider that besides her not sleeping much, resting as needed, reflecting as needed, how she valued the people that were colleagues of her. Her perception at the time were not that she was a hero for the sake of being a hero. Likely she happened to be living the role of a hero that cared too much, like a mother would when she sacrifices herself for her child even to a point of putting her child at risk.

The situation given by Melissa had inspired me to consider how systems and tools also comes with narratives that can be influential in own ways and can suggest to ourselves to embrace roles, or personalities, or to be an identity. As an illustration, I have drawn from Melissa's metaphor of the cape - which luckily for her she left behind or buried - to consider the one of an an young founder that finds the cape and then becomes interested in becoming. 

It matters too that brands are not only making tools with the user at the center - or as they say using a user-centered design - but also in fact marketing their products/services by positioning the customer as a protagonist. In the methodology from Building a Story Brand, Donald Miller advices brands to avoid common marketing mistakes of producing messages where the brand is positioned as the hero and the customer merely is helped. For Donald Miller, brands should not compete with their potential customers and instead should make their customers as the real heroes thus becoming supporters of their customer's journey towards success. What you get as a result of their method becomes a compelling message exactly because it goes all the way into understanding who are their customers, not only their basic needs but why they are looking for what they are looking for: 

> *"What most brands miss, however, is that there are three levels of problems a customer encounters. In stories, heroes encounter external, internal, and philosophical problems. Why? Because these are the same three level of problems human beings face in their everyday lives. Almost all companies try to sell solutions to external problems, but as we unfold the StoryBrand Framework, you'll see why customers are much more motivated to resolve their inner frustrations."* (Miller, Donald., xxxx, p. 31).

In other words, Donald Miller had figured - from the the stuff that makes stories great - that customers will listen to the stories of brands - and accordinly buy their solutions - as they identify with others that not only share their same immediate problems but also share the same aspirations. 

In the journey to write this book, and before I set myself as a real writer by writing it everyday, I happened to have told a great writer about ChatGPT as a writing assistant, and how I was using it successfully to write essays. I have given to her some good deal of details of how I was able to instruct the tool which might have given to me some superpowers. Of course, I wasn't thinking that the tool would make me a writer. I was more like focusing on my objective, as I thought. But it was only after her comment that I saw the connection that I was then becoming a different kind of writer because of the tool: 

> *"Marcio, do not make a song or dance about what is a simple activity. And do not go looking for tools. Your brain is the tool. Think it through."* Barbara's message to Marcio. 

It may not be for you, I know, the sort of awakening call I got. But the moment that Barbara told me that writing is a simple activity, she had provoked me to see things from another pespective. First, that I was projecting myself as a sort of hero with a tool. When I noticed that, I was able to see the likelyhood of myself allowing the tool to control the conduction, or my style, which only later I realized the magnitude if I had trusted the tool too much which could even make me lost by the movements of the tool. The real difficult to see, before her note, was due to myself being excited with the tool, plus the fact that tool had helped me to gain an improved perspective about how to be a writer, or to be a better writer. The outcome, after the reflection from her comments, was that I didn't allow my own self that seemed to be another kind of hero with a tool, to be a conductor of the writing orchestra. Today, for example, after being closer to a real conductor of my writing, I know that the use of a tool can be done by the performer that works for the conductor, not the other way around. To give you an example, I sometimes ask the tool to read a section from the perspective of an entrepreneur, or an investor, as in to test coherence or if potential interpretations of a viewpoint given. Notice the difference - from using a tool to the situation of believing that you are a superhero because of the tool. 

An observation from Steve Blank about the emergence of digital systems is also a great opportunity to reflect our propensity to see ourselves as others because of tools:  

> *"When page-layout programs came out with the Macintosh in 1984, everyone thought it was going to be the end of graphic artists and designers. “Now everyone can do design,” was the mantra. Users quickly learned how hard it was do design well (yes. it is an art) and again hired professionals. The same thing happened with the first bit-mapped word processors. We didn’t get more or better authors. Instead we ended up with poorly written documents that looked like ransom notes. Today’s equivalent is Apple’s “Garageband”. Not everyone who uses composition tools can actually write music that anyone wants to listen to. "* (Blank, Steve., 2011)

In the book *The Chaos Machine: How Social Networks Reprogrammed Our Mind and Our World*, Max Fisher (2023) recounts the story of a monk named Wirathu, who was catapulted to fame in Myanmar after the country emerged from a long period of isolation and embraced the Internet and social media. Wirathu's rise and his ability to influence a newly connected nation illustrate the intricate relationship between connectivity, identity, and the potentially destructive power of an unchallenged alternate reality.

Wirathu's story begins with a dark past, confined to an environment of hate during his imprisonment. However, his homeland, Myanmar, underwent significant transformations during his detention, including the widespread adoption of the Internet and social media, largely thanks to a partnership with the United States. In partnership with Silicon Valley leaders and former President Barack Obama, Myanmar made a rapid transition to the digital age.

As a result, the Internet - particularly platforms like Facebook and YouTube - became a stage for Wirathu to communicate with followers and increase his influence. According to Fisher, Wirathu enjoyed a popularity that propelled his communication with the world in a way that was unimaginable before the Internet era. Previously, he would have had to travel across the country to spread his words and gain followers. On social media, however, Wirathu's words were amplified by the users themselves, driving a biased narrative. According to the story as he "accused the Muslim minority in Myanmar of horrendous crimes, mixing rumors with fabrications" (Fisher, p.55, our translation), he had created an alternate reality that became alarmingly mainstream thanks to his celebrity status.

Fisher highlights that the people of Myanmar were introduced to Facebook in an already developed state, creating a kind of digital explosion. Consequently, as users engaged with social media, they built or reinforced their identities. The popularity and echo within the support group became projections of the reality fueling a confirmation bias that overlooked any counter-argument. Therefore, users came to interpret the popularity of a post or figure like Wirathu as a validation of their beliefs and perceptions, strengthening their identity while simultaneously creating a cycle of bias confirmation that amplified the alternative narrative. 

In a notable episode, this dynamic culminated in violent attacks on the Muslim minority, motivated by information spread through social media. Wirathu and Myanmar's case, as described by Fisher, highlights the power of social media in a newly connected society. What were once unconfirmed fragments of beliefs became, in the digital age, mass validation of an alternative identity and narrative, providing users with a distorted sense of reality and morality. 

Now, and besides the reflection given by Walter about the urgency of addressing the spread of misinformation and hatred on social media aiming a safer and more inclusive digital future, it is innevitable to now consider the scenario that the system had created Wirathu; that he had evolved it is clear. But it can be difficult to see that Wirathu were not into a discovering of his true self but it were in fact onto embracing a potential. In other words Wirathu might have been accelerated by its growth space he nurtured. It's the chicken and egg problem.

## Escape hatch  









Many successful entrepreneurs have created companies that have taken new directions and have indeed found happiness in this state of evolution. Not much needs to be said about this because everyone is entitled to live new passions. Moreover, it is not uncommon for art to become mediocre, but the artist is content with the new art once it meets the world. Perhaps this explains authors, like singers, who discover or stumble upon markets and are enchanted with their mediocre works, live moments of fame, live happily, and thus propagate their arts.

However, in this interaction with the world, in the confrontation with changes, the identity created by the entrepreneur also encounters discontentment when it does not evolve and may even die; thus it is perceived, felt, because the creator is co-responsible for their formed identity, their previous work. However, the situation of a major ship - such as of now a grown up startup living its corporate life - the movement or the encourter with what disrupts will provoke the positioning from the executive team and therefore the whole organization. They either embrace or lock the company as an event in time for a reflection.

> *"We still don't know what makes composers. We understand the category of better performers. But founders it is still kind of misterious."* Steve Blank 


> *"Founders fit the definition of a composer: they see something no one else does. And to help them create it from nothing, they surround themselves with world-class performers. This concept of creating something that few others see – and the reality distortion field necessary to recruit the team to build it – is at the heart of what startup founders do. It is a very different skill than science, engineering, or management. Entrepreneurial employees are the talented performers who hear the siren song of a founder’s vision. Joining a startup while it is still searching for a business model, they too see the promise of what can be and join the founder to bring the vision to life. Founders then put in play every skill which makes them unique – tenacity, passion, agility, rapid pivots, curiosity, learning and discovery, improvisation, ability to bring order out of chaos, resilience, leadership, a reality distortion field, and a relentless focus on execution – to lead the relentless process of refining their vision and making it a reality."* (Blank, 2011)

Steve really touches the point of transcendence that embraces possibility, that unlocks the opportunity ahead, and supports the founders to not be trapped by any identity in a given moment, such as to be enamorated with an idea. 

What if, the thought could be turned into as "We are just starting" again. Perhaps that is a way to escape the negative side of the calling. This escape hatch opens the way for growth, for the full realization, and towards leadership. But it isn't easy to see from outside what we do. For that, we need to first acknowledge that it is important - first step - and then with spirit of a true entrepreneur - volunteering to learn - we step up into to find our answers. In a way, the entrepreneur is a generator of an art, it becomes the art in progress in itself, thus she needs to become the curator of its arts.

Music composition has been around since the dawn of civilization yet even today the argument of what “makes” a great composer is still unsettled. Is it the process (the compositional strategies used in the compositional process?) Is it the person (achievement, musical aptitude, informal musical experiences, formal musical experiences, music self-esteem, academic grades, IQ, and gender?)  Is it the environment (parents, teachers, friends, siblings, school, society, or cultural values?) Or is it constant practice (apprenticeship, 10,000 hours of practice?)*" (Blank, 2011)

### Grown up ship 




As much as I hope that you are reading this book in the paper format, you may be reading it in a e-book device, or in your mobile device, or perhaps your e-dog is reading it to you (Dog: Start laughing joyfully and intensely, then gradually slow down your laughter until it fades away, mimicking the transition from being highly amused to becoming bored or slow.) 

It goes with that whatever electronic device that you are using it that directly or indirectly exists because the evolution and work done by Intel - Intel the iconic Silicon Valley that reigned as a kind of the category known as microprocessor, or the personal computer microprocessor, or the computer's brain when personal computers started to spread around the world. 

Andy Grove, when going through his evolution as a CEO, had given to us great good reflections about the challenges of running a major ship when the waters start to change, when the winds start to change, the winds of competition. 

In this section we will bring the reflection by Andy Grove, the late CEO of Intel, that made an elaboration about the states of emotion of executives driving large organizations in a comparisong with the phases of grief. The recognition of the case of Andy about INtel's challenge to rehink the identity of the executive team, their position, and the theme that Andy brought where they were able to challenge themselves, himself and Gordon, the conversation in the office when they looked at the Great America ferriswheel. 

If we set our time machine to 1985, and land ourselves in the Ferris wheel of the Great America park in Santa Clara California, we would be able to point our binoculars to Intel's headquarters and witness that special conversation between Andy Grove and Gordon Moore, as documented in *Only The Paranoid Survive*, the conversation that marks a moment of transcendence from Intel management that took them to "The bold decision to commit Intel’s future to microprocessors," [^foonote_hbr_intel_1996] which brought Intel a major transformation to the world, that consumers get that Intel meant the computer's brains: 

[^foonote_hbr_intel_1996]: The article from HBR titled "Inside Intel" by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff (1996), underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of industry crises and technological shifts. In essence, the article considers Intel's journey through significant challenges, including the competitive pressure from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers in the mid-1980 which led to a strategic pivot from memory chips to microprocessors, and how the success from transformation brings new challenges, like a totally new game or sport where the organization has to transcend in order to survive.  

> *"I remember a time in the middle of 1985, after this aimless wandering had been going on for almost a year. I was in my office with Intel's chairman and CEO, Gordon Moore, and we were discussing our quandary. Our mood was downbeat. I looked out the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon and asked, 'If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?' Gordon answered without hesitation, 'He would get us out of memories.' I stared at him, numb, then said, "Why shouldn't you and I walk out the door, come back and do it ourselves?'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 89)

### Viewpoints from the historical flights

The following whole section is from https://medium.com/startup-check-in/let-there-be-light-our-ancestor-entrepreneurs-and-your-next-startup-ideas-cc64c4573bb8

When Patrick Collison was invited to talk about his fast-growing company at the Technology-enabled Blitzscaling classes, instructor John Lilly pointed out that “he walked in with a book made of paper, which is always very exciting.” Further down the interview, John wonders why he has so much interest in history.

For Patrick, it’s a way to cheat. Everyone else ignores all the good ideas from history, and so you can just be much smarter by just, you know — you could just try to think all these incredibly original thoughts by sort of sitting down and staring at the wall for days on end — or you can sort of cheat by just, you know, I mean they are, in fact, written down in books that you can just read. (Patrick Collison — Greylock Partners, 2015, 11:17)

Patrick’s point almost passed without myself noticing what is so special. But it turns out that I was reading an amazing history book - The Power Makers, by historian Maury Klein - at the time, which helped me to reflect and consider why entrepreneurs should read about history such as history of technology, history of entrepreneurs, and more. 

When great historians drag us back in time, they help us better understand how factors, such as the external environment, such as period and the cultural environment, have an effect in entrepreneur’s decisions and goals. It’s like you are transported into the protagonists but also giving the protection so that you are not lost like a protagonist. The protection is the space of opportunity to reflect about the currents of the time, the factors influencing, challenges, and more. 

It provoke us into questioning things like what brings us to come up with ideas? Is it pain? Or love? Or a major obstacle on their way? Is it a vision or an epiphany, after he had long years of thinking and living through challenges first-hand? What made them pursue a life of entrepreneurship? what factors contributes for us to persevere for decades?

Connecting the dots leading to innovation. The view from above, or from the cockpit with a narrator using the time capsule, might also give us the view of hot the dots are connected, for how inventors bring their ideas to market: from the background, to how the idea first appeared, moving to how they evolved into an early product, showing the potential pitfalls or how ideas are brought to the market.

It’s like a view from the above that conciliates how external factors are influential to entrepreneurship. What pitfalls we can find? What obstacles appears in front of us? What are the conditions that can favor the further development of our goals? Will the environment be friendly in the short, medium and long run?

It’s great to learn about successes. But historians will also tell you about the failures; and more, the failures of first movers, such as the life and death of inventors and entrepreneurs that could not bring their ideas as they have envisioned, and the potential later realization, by others, of what those first movers had envisioned. This level of contrast help entrepreneurs to better understand a macro view for how inventors and inventions correlate and collaborate in the long run and the leadership compoment that mad things to become real. 

Consider the situation of John Fitch which is credited as one of the inventors of the commercial steamboat service. His product, Perseverance, was launched in 1790 as a commercial steamboat service but didn't do well and was abandoned. 15 years later, as history shows, a successfully implemented solution was brought by Robert Fulton, that was a bit less inventor and more of an assembler and able to focus on the service. 
 
> *“Fitch advertised the service heavily and the boat performed admirably — going five hundred miles before suffering mechanical problems — but the passengers did not come. In desperation, the partners offered free food and drinks on board, but every voyage continued to lose money. What had proven to be technological triumph turned out to be a commercial failure, and the service was abandoned after that first summer. His investors backed away, and Fitch eventually found himself nearly penniless once again.”* (Klein, 2009, p. 46)

Reading how amazing inventions were born helps us soften our minds and better recognize how much biased we are, how humble we should be. Consider the situation of Ampere and Coulomb which were convicted about the lack of relationship between electricity and magnetism, leading to the general acceptance that no relationship existed between these areas. Such belief persisted for about 20 years, when suddenly however an unknown professor hits a discovery by chance: It was during an experiment with his students when professor Oersted were melting wires and noticed that a compass moved every time the electricity was being turned on/off.

After such discovery Oersted published a paper. While Ampere priorly did not believe in such relationship, this was a real experiment, therefore easy to replicate. From that moment, Ampere not only accepted but he immediately started contributing to this new field in a matter of two months.

In the above passage, new opportunities appeared after that irrefutable observation of effects of the physical world, enabling the status-quo of scientists to be dropped quickly. They other words, they had to accept change as their environment was changing. 

Productizing an idea depends on many factors such as vision and engineering capacity. But it won’t necessarily mean your target customer is ready to accept the proposed and envisioned product. And even if they are, it does not mean that all the forces in the future will favor your product to enter and sustain itself in the market.

### Changing goggles 





For closing, we shall consider the very situation of growth for the business, or the need for growth, that can be used as a way to shock-aborb any potential interpretations and characterization of how founders are conducting. The experimentation, or exercise, of transcending and doing analysis of the business for the future, which will likely set the theme of tops-down needs, taken from vision and higher-order goals, objectives, which will embrace the development of the business, may be a good exercise to put the present execution under a degree of scrutinity.

For Michael Dearing, lecturer and investor at Harrison Metal, founders should evaluate themselves and understand the differences between coming up with an insight, developing a product, and developing a whole business:

> *"First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to, hopefully God willing, turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)

### Revisiting our identities 






It should, then, be considered, that the attachment with certain groups, or entities, and even frameworks and tools - which are by the way not only connected but also empowered by communities, can be the very things that set us to then be supported by social representations which may support us to understanding that feeding that current identity is alive or doing well or that it can be promising. So this might be simply our operating system running its normal and efficient process which under the checked concrete values we found which may be associated with behavior we then feed our own profecies but if that is too far then at least a sign that we are in right direction. From the sake of the actual behaviours - which is what counts for us - it might be then the materialization of a characterization of identity, or a formation of it, for the doer that engages with that practice, and with that the implication of identity attachment, which in itself acts as value, therefore it becomes valued as the things we take that we cannot lose or that when under attack we may react to preserve which may become strongly than the general things perceived as necessary. 

When I explore the case of tools and systems - it might be confusing - so it deserves some elaboration. I mean that one that is skilled with a tool and by the using it had achieved success - by the eyes of whoever are the eyes that supports his motivations and developments - will then see herself as an skilled in that tool. When I was going through the struggle phase in my career as a writer (which I believe might be one of my identities now) it happened that ChatGPT was launched by OpenAI. I found fascinating that I could ask the tool - or system - with a degree of innocence and put up some bits and pieces of logic and asked it to produce an article and even pointed a logic of storytelling to the points of the article. I happened to publish a couple of these articles in an online publication and even gotten promoted - achieved a higher-rank as a writer. To defend myself I wasn't cheating and actually developed quite well an interaction with the tool that led me to a much better article. But then, at the same time I found another trouble from that. I was out of the sudden, given that raise or promotion, passionated or feeling movitated of myself as someone like a composer being able to tell the robot to engage in many specific activities. I was feeling like an expert in the science and art of taming the robot to come up with better articles. Then, the move I evolved into the movement I also caught myself struggling, and being a bit confused, or to working for the robot too or being influenced by its words too. Through my interactions when I was yet promoting the robot's amazing work - and with that my abilty to control it - I happened to share thoughts about my discoveries with a great writer. At some point, she told me to "not make a dance or song about a simple activity." She has told me to "think it through.". And she reminded me that my brain is the tool. That, along with a permission from Julia Cameron - from The Right to Write - a permission to write with errors and setting my critic-editor aside (as we have covered) I started to do what writers do and the rest is history, I wrote for one year almost every day and was able to complete the book. Lessons taken: I have left the position of thinking that I was a master of that tool. The tool had helped me in the book too. For example, I have asked the tool to check citations, to write some of the footnotes, and many other creative usages that really editors do, even to make abstracts of my chapters so that I could check if the tool was able to understand my points - like a reader. But I didn't fall in the trap of thinking I were the champion or a master of the tool, a master like any master that becomes the slave by living the position of a master which is essentially a trap of being a controller. 

And by that, as discussed, the attachment with such identity, or identities, may be assumed to be a source of greater value although which may not be true, just like a human may enjoy the perceived benefits of an inclusion in a given group but that does not give the final answer of who that person is, or better, who they are ought to become, and in fact may even harm that person's path as they represent, they act, they are directed in their reasoning, and directed in their decision, which may harm their self development path, their true aspirations, the formation of who they are to become. A supporting line to this general idea can be guided by the enlighted line of thinking of Amarthya Sen in Identity and Violence: 

> *"In our normal lives, we see ourselves as members of a variety of groups - we belong to all of them. A person's citizenship, residence, geographic origin, gender, class, politics, profession, employment, food habits, sports interestsm taste in music, social commitments, etc., make us members of a variety of groups. Each of these collectivities, to all of which this person simultaneously belongs, gives her a particular identity. None of them can be taken to be the person's only identity or singular membership category." (Sen, 2006, p.2)
