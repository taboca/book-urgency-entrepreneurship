Am I an artist? That kind of question seems to be unlikely thought by entrepreneurs, especially if they're generally too busy in their craft. But there's something about artists and entrepreneurs that seems intriguing, because their worlds seem to be so close and so far from each other. I have wondered what would Steve Jobs do in 1475 if we were born in Caprese, Italy, and if Michelangelo and Bonarotti were born in Jobs Place, San Francisco, California, in 1955. As much as I want to think of Michelangelo being an entrepreneur, then I get a slap in the face by the consideration that Bonarotti could be a software engineer working at Google or that Steve of 1475 would have died too soon thus imortalized and known mostly for his first Apple scupture. 

But there's still something between artists and entrepreneurs that can help us to understand better their behaviors, their personalities and their identities. By considering the comparison with artists, I invite you to consider their journey, as they start may not be so clear that they are in fact artists or entrepreneurs.

There's no guarantee that they would get money, or acceptance or recognition to start with,  from that craft, but they do it in a way. In the beginning, the environment is chaotic but they have the foot on the ground, and they're interested in learning the craft as well. They also seem to have some eager spirit, as in, that no one can stop me from looking for the answers I seek. And if the horizon is gray, they see a rainbow, and they carve and they fail, and they do it again and again until they succeed. And then, that's when things seem to work, and the signal comes from what seemed to be noise before. Now, the other component that seems to exist has to do with the outcomes. I like to think about growth and not in terms of money, because that better explains the case of successful entrepreneurs and great artists as they achieve growth in the sense of connecting with their audiences, and some of them get lots of money as well, or recognition, you name it. They seem to be consistent in a way, to be validated, that what they have brought to the world is accepted by an audience, is embraced by the audience, call them consumers or users, it really doesn't matter. But now they have support in many aspects, that can be financcial, psychological, and even new sparks for enlightened new journeys. 

Furthermore, I think that in a way, they achieve a change, or they transcend, and they understand that they were onto something. After the fact, they seem to be able to better connect the dots [^footnote_stevejobs_connectingdots], to explain what they're doing, and to better understand their job to be done.

[^footnote_stevejobs_connectingdots]: In his 2005 Stanford University commencement speech, Steve Jobs talks about "connecting the dots" to illustrate that it is impossible to figure what is our life path by looking forward; but possible to do so looking backward. Jobs highlighted that passions might lead to developments that leads to understanding - that dots from his life, like dropping out of college and studying calligraphy, later played a crucial role in the design of Apple computers (Jobs, 2005).

Now, from that journey, and by assuming a certain stage of achievement, it may help us to understand about their identities. As noted, they might have changed and transcended or learned - from the failures - and by now they have a relationship with their craft. For some of them, it could be that they think that what they do is really their destiny, or it doesn't have to be that far, but they may still think that they have discovered their identities. But as much as we think that we're discovering ourselves, or of best selves, the work situation and the situation of the artists and the situation of entrepreneurs might be the actual space that shapes our identities, exactly as we go through the steps of that ladder, being supported in many ways, accepted, recognized. That's exactly a source of complications that sets challenges before achievements and after achievement - the confirmations creates an anchor for them. It becomes very difficult for them to do it again, like to do a great art again or to do a great best-selling book again, or to reinvent their own companies in the face of challenges, to launch new amazing products, to do it again the art cycle. And by that realization, we're in front of the most beautiful and complex thing in life which is to be able to grow and to let growth behind - the necessity to transcend, to change ourselves, to creatively destroy ourselves; That's what we're concerned with in this chapter.

With the sections below, we will start our reflection by looking at the journey of the self that is starts the movement with passion and motivations. Looking from the holistic view of growth - which indeed starts with the sparks from a particular vision, or from strong values, or even passion from performing, or great ambitions - we will reflect about how passions and motivations are key to drive them into good and bad outcomes. Then we focus within their bubbles, so that we can witness themselves caught in what they think is a path of growth, and in what gives them the status of protagonists, to reflect on the struggle through the interactions and feelings that happens in realtime as they climb through a ladder of affairs and associations with the environment that feeds them for good or bad. Then we come back to the reflection outside their bubbles, to consider how we can break it and challenge the perceptions about our roles; where a better destiny is to embrace ourselves as the whole that lives multiple identities.

















## Driven by vision

<!--
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Pitch - A vision for who we are doing it? It can't be normal vision [feat. AG] 
--> 






Let us assume that entrepreneurs, like artists, are following a vision. But I don't mean that kind of vision where one would be a followed of something envisioned as if they could commit to implementing the dots - as if they could get the dots that comes after the fact. I thankful for the analogies with artists because it helped me to shift away from that notion - as that is certainly not what artists do - is an idea I better consolidated when I read from Adam Grant, in Originals that Da Vinci had done about 1200 drawings, to name an example. 

Let us assume a vision for how we see ourselves bringing ourselves into something that we might be onto it which we don't fully know of. Therefore, here and for us and far from the limelights, it might be a vision for a startup being executed by the self or the self executing a startup. 

At least I find comfort using that viewpoint because there are many that start *that* other kind of vision but then are caught doing it and doing it happily while their original vision has vanished. Another reason to set that typical vision aside was given by Andy Grove in *High Output Management* when he said that vision is a lofty word: 

> *""* (Grove, A., 1999, p. xxx)

* Outline - Situation - Calling [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 








But even if a static vision is not there, and if we envision ourselves doing it, yet we are not into it in any arbitrary way. This is about the right moment to invite the viewpoint from an entrepreneur, an investor, a professor of innovaton and entrepreneurship, a praticioner in the field of startups and known for having originated the the lean startup movement - Steve Blank [^steveblanklean]. 

[^steveblanklean]: Steve Blank is a renowned entrepreneur and academic recognized for being one of the pioneers of the Lean Startup movement. Blank, along with Eric Ries, helped define and propagate the Lean Startup philosophy, which proposes the creation of companies and products under conditions of extreme uncertainty. His work, characterized by "customer development" and the idea of "get out of the building," is a fundamental pillar of this methodology. Blank emphasizes the importance of validated learning, iterative product development, and rapid response to customer needs as key principles for innovation in startups.

When asked to give a single piece of advice for founders, he had given first his perspective with the notion that being a founder is not a job as we know it. He had reported not believing that he was working in Silicon Valley and being paid to do what he would do for free (Blank, 2014) or that he might even pay to have the opportunity. If that notion is a bit not so normal to many people, we still have to agree that it gotta have something - as in to be driven by passions - to that that initial thing going, what keeps the gas tank full for the the journey where the odds are against, to climb the pyramid or the ladder, to go towards the expected situation of growth, or success, or one, but starting from zero: 

> *"Founders is not a job, is a calling... This is not some job. The odds of you making money... versus working at McDonalds, it’s a much better bet that you will be making more money in your career working at McDonalds. You need to do what you are doing because you love it, because you can’t think of anything better to do with your life. And if that is not the case, don’t do this because it’s going to be a miserable 10 or 20 years. If you are looking at getting rich like the Facebook boys, or the Google boys, or whatever the hot startup is now, that is the wrong reason to do it. If you are chasing the money, I will guarantee you, the more you chase it, the further away is goes."* (Blank, 2014, 34:33)

--> 

Now if the above saying of Steve sounds as an extremme case, I insist in calling our attention to the essence for the phenomenon that sets in, where a notion of calling explains us driving our movement, and for that we gotta have passions and motivations, that are purely driven by the outcomes expected but it is the thing that keeps us going on as we do it, as we put our hands, as we carve, as we fail. It is even the thing that makes them to be happy with the idea of failing and failing til you succeed.

Andy Grove, in *High Output Management*, having considered the work situation that might be in it because might be trying to maintain its motivation hierarchy pyramid intact. The work situation appears to be a place to get that going: 

> *"Money has significance at all levels of Maslow's motivation hierarchy. As noted earlier, a person needs money to buy food, housing, and insurance policies, which are part of his physiological and safety/security needs. As one moves up the need hierarchy, money begins to mean something else - a measure of one's worth in a competitive environment. Earlier I have described a simple test that can be applied to determine the role money plays for someone. If the *absolute* amount of raise in salary is important, that person is probably motivated by physiological or safety security needs. If the *relative* amount of a raise - what he got compared to others - is the important issue, that person is likely to be motivated by self-actualization, because money here is a measure, not a necessity."* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 213)

Now consider a successful entrepreneur - or a successful manager or successful worker - or in essence one that feels good with what they do, with the execution. It might be observable a certain relationship with what they do, with why they do, with how they do. Through this relationship with work or through activities we may get an idea of who they are, their identity. They happen to see themselves by that act of working. With that, assuming a stable journey of work - a good weekly cadence such as 6 hours per day - it can be fairly considered that ther work journey shapes who they are, their identities. Some of this may resonate with the reflections from Abraham Maslow from when he was invited to reflect about the work situation during a summer at Non-linear Systems in California, when he said that "These highly evolved individuals assimilate their work into their identity into their self, i.e., work actually becomes part of the self part of the individual's definition of himself." (1998. p.1)

--> 

Now while the reflection from Maslow were based in a work situation of a company considering an enlightened management during the 1960s,  Thus to think about a kind of work that supports the self comes from observations that there are, or in the ideal world it could exist, a situation of work that allows one to grow up in the ladder of the hierarchy of needs [^footnote_maslow_needs_hierarchy] That given the phisiological needs satisfied, for example that the work pays health insurance, that the work is safe, and that a compensation enables the person to sustain a healthy life; and given a work that also brings psychological safety, where people are welcome to be themselves, where their creativivity can flowrish, where they are not pressured to be who they aren't, and given that the environment of colleagueship exists, and given that the work supports them all to work in harmonious ways, then it would be acceptable that a self development may happen and by that happening is it likely that the identity of self would be pushed further by the work situation. Or, promoted in a way by this healthy work environment. With that said, naturally this is not the only way where one continues to develop her identity; because social interactions of many forms may either promote that too such as when one is involved with multiple jobs or activities or one participates in a healthy community.

[^footnote_maslow_needs_hierarchy]: The concept of human needs for motivation and development has been explored from both psychological and business perspectives. Abraham Maslow first introduced the hierarchy of needs in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" published in the Psychological Review, proposing a pyramid structure of human needs from physiological to self-actualization. Andy Grove, in his book "High Output Management," recognized the employees' basic needs as a foundation for higher productivity and self-actualization within the workplace.

* Complication - That the journey is not a journey of discovery of their performers, such as existing. It may be a journey of shaping, shaped by performing and influneced by dynamic passions and motivations. 
--> 







Now if we shift away from the idea of an existing vision as a main driver of entrepreneurship, where entrepreneurs would merely be performers that could do better or worse, and instead shift our focus to consider passions and motivations are the actual better key drivers for entrepreneurship, we shall naturally embrace a more dynamic view for what makes an entrepreneur an entrepreneur during the journey and the possibility that their identities are either reinforced or shaped by the activities of the journey, therefore what seems sometimes to be a journey of discovery where one is performing for serving the entity of the startup might be an actual journey where fusion might born where the self that performs influences the path of the startup this is generally a source of the pride that makes the entrepreneurship happen it's where passion can indeed set one to make things considered impossible but on the other hand the concern in this section is the very realization that these passions and motivations are reinforced by the actual strategic steps and tactical steps in the execution that goes on throughout the journey.

To point an example of a complication, consider the illustration given by Andy Groove about the role of money and the relativeness of the presence of money and how it impacts the motivations for the execution of the entrepreneurial journey. If the startup starts with no customers at all, the possibility of one customer paying will indeed make that single piece of data to be recognized as customer. And the sensation for achieving that from nothing is compared in relative terms. Later many entrepreneurs find out that some of the initial customers need to be left behind because they're not the right kind of customers. Or consider when their startup acquires a subset of initial customers that shows no potential in terms of the growth and the future, but now depends on it because the paycheck and the physiological needs are fulfilled either in terms of the life of the entrepreneurs they're bootstrapping or in terms of a model that shows a representation that the startup is standing on its own. In other words, the entrepreneurial journey happens to be an interaction where the entrepreneurs are the ones being proud of the activities, are the ones empowered and entitled to accelerate and to pause the very activities that are very significant, bringing these numbers up and down at all times. And the regulation of their behaviors it's something usually driven by dispassions and motivations, especially in the hurry and fast-paced environment. They can't, unfortunately, focus in reasoning and reflecting from the wider view about the possibilities that they could be running in a trap. In other words, they become performers. In other words, they actually access the idea that they are sort of following a pre-existing vision. In other words, they're accessing and executing the idea that they are discovering their best selves for doing something. Instead of being shaped by the very specific milestones happening in front of them.

Normally, and in the heat of the execution in the future of fast-paced work mentality, we find no reason to run on our own parade, to mess up with the very idea that gives us the strength to make everything such as the impossible possible. In other words, if these individual doers are laying tracks, and if any harassing happens to happen to them occasionally, much of it happens to self-enforce what works for them. All that goes along with the fast-paced culture of executing based on learnings in retrospect, which is generally a great idea if we think of the doer as a performer, although that's not the case for entrepreneurs, because they shall be more like conductors. And an example of a problem is the general culture of the doer that tries to identify their best strengths and only focus on best strengths, such as by doing psychological tests as if they're playing with themselves at the founder level, the entrepreneur level, as they would, for example, if they really need a specialist profile for a specific need in their company.

By pausing and reflecting about these aspects, we can gain an improved awareness about the entrepreneurial journey as formed by the personalities and characters and identities of entrepreneurs. In the next sessions, we're going to consider two viewpoints. The first from the entrepreneur side, considering that they can be in passion with these aspects that can set them to be too involved in the process or enamorated with the idea or focusing too much on the product side, the passions that can set them in a specific direction miss the whole growth curve. And then the other viewpoint from the vision of the investors or the gatekeepers of growth, which are equally concerned about the behaviors of founders and teams, their identities. And as much as they appreciate their passion, they know that can be a fuel to bring them harm, can prevent the whole business into the growth situation due to obsessions, such as that can cause destruction to the business and the growth situations, if not the well-being of entrepreneurs.

In other words, entrepreneurs might be productive or happy or good about with the things they do through the journey, the job steps [^footnote_jtbd_jobsteps] of their startup's journey. They may love to "Determine their goals and plan resources," or they enjoy to "Gather items and information needed to do the job," or like to "Set up the environment to do the job," or appreciate to "Verify that they’re ready to perform the job," or smile that they can "Carry out the job,", or have fun when they "Assess whether the job is being successfully executed", or are proud to "Make alterations to improve execution," or they worship when they "Finish the job or prepare to repeat it."

[^footnote_jtbd_jobsteps]: The Job Map by Strategyn (2024) says that all kinds of jobs have 8 steps. From that fundamental thinking I got inspired to think about the job of making a startup, or the job of a team seeking to innovate by making a company.

By our involvement with that calling into the job to be done, the job of growth, we essentially set ourselves in a a context where productivity matters and we get into the evaluation of ourselves and into assessing our identities as entrepreneurs; which sets in attitudes, behaviours, processes or towards being matured in a way, by the - or multiplied - by the confirmations from the feedback that we get after the actions we had executed. We will essentially be proud of our styles, and the approaches, or the decisions we made when things seem to give signs of positive results across the range of activities.

* Outline - Harmonious or obsessive - Case of "How to break into Silicon Valley" [feat. Andrew Chen]
--> 





Consider the following perspective, given by Andrew Chen from A16Z, for *How to Break into Silicon Valley*, where he gives a perspective for how productive conversations can be achieved through introductions when one is particularly involved in what he had referred as "having a thing" or a particulaly interesting quest. Since the optimistic perspective is self-evident, I ask you to read the following excerpt by trying to celebrate, or picture, how powerful or impactful the discussions could be, for when we the promoter lives in that position of promoting the conversations while living a situation where they think of themselves as protagonists of a a particularly interesting quest. 

> *That said, the conversations are more productive when you have “a thing.” What I mean by that is that all of these conversations and networking are more useful when you are starting a company, creating a new podcast, are working on a new project or book, or something else. When you have a directed goal in mind, then the conversations often are more valuable for all parties involved, because you were making yourself an expert in a particular area and your questions are more relevant. Otherwise you will surely encounter very busy people who simply refuse to “grab coffee” to “catch up” because it’s a poor use of time. I encourage you to be on a quest of your own, and even better a particularly interesting quest, so that your conversations with people can be as productive as possible.
> In my case, I was very interested in the state of the art on growing users, metrics, network effects, and marketing. I asked everyone about this topic, and began to develop my own ideas that I would share freely. Eventually, it became clear that a few small communities orienting the PayPal mafia were the furthest along in their thinking. And that’s how I ended up being exposed first to concepts like retention curves, DAU/MAU, viral loops, and so on. 
> These ideas were interest to me, because my professional experience leading up to that point was actually an adtech. I had previously worked in online ads, with customers from WSJ, CBS, MySpace, etc, and had even gotten a patent filed on ad targeting (yes, US7747676B1). I had a superpower in my domain knowledge of CAC, A/B testing, funnel optimization, lead gen, etc, and began to merge all of this thinking with consumer products. In 2007 this was cutting edge at a time when product success was often measured by vanity metrics such as the total registrations for a product. This bit of specialized knowledge was what I brought to the table, and I talked about some of those learnings and ideas, and how they might apply to products. Sometimes I’d get intros to interesting people simply because of this expertise, which I appreciated."*

The illustration of Andrew, although not precisely story of an founder, greatly shows a situation that is entrepreneurial in nature and how we see ourselves riven by our passions and motivations but conscious about our performance as conductors through the network that is of our interest. In other words, even the very initial movement of approaching their best audience - which they quite respect - shows the necessity of a prior movement from passions and motivations. Besides that, the additional movement, even when it yields introductions, has a potential of supporting and motivating, thus becomes a self-validating movement, by the very characteristic of the high-profile audience. It supportes their performance at every movement, it supports their courage, it supports their talents, expertise, their conduction in general, themselves.

When I joined an accelerator program in 2016 I had a badge labeled "empresário." That is the thing that a Brazilian would fill in a form to describe their title - as the responsible that runs a tax-paying business entity. In addition, I was also an entrepreneur. And secretly I saw myself as a sort of artist. And not secretly although trying to hide at that time I was a software developer. And out of curiosity I had other titles such as Web Master from back in the good old days when the movie Jurrassic Park came out. And now I just remembered that being a Web Master brought me to become a Web Developer  [^footnote_marciogalli_webdevelopers]. 

[^footnote_marciogalli_webdevelopers]: In *The History of Web Developers Tied to Browser Development* (2023), I had had the opportunity to reflect about the emergence of the role known as the "web developer." That the environment, the emergence of browsers, have helped to shape the role. It seems to be, as we see people working, that the craft shapes them, to a certain degree. This may be the be observable in some corporate situations, like the corporations from the west from the late 1900s to and early 2000s. And it is likely what makes the perception of performance - assuming that their colleagues understand them, that their colleagues trust them, that they predict what they do and how they do - as much it makes them to create impactful outcomes - good or bad.

But then, in that new domain of being accelerated (as they would say), a new title was coming my way quite fast. I noticed it the day they invited me to speak. Before the event they requested the "bio," which is basically a short story so that they can introduce the speaker. I gave them the bio thing but followed by my name, my current title, and the name of my company. But as the limelight turned on I was surprised to be introduced as "Marcio, an aspiring founder." I can't say I loved it because the first thing that went through my head was "Where is my bio thing?" 

But like my colleagues being *accelerated*, I weren't there to be worried about my title. The startup in the future needed the founder in the present. But then, and again, we right there, and living the feeling of what happens, I was quite into what I considered to be conscious of what I do, how I do, why I do, and who I am. In other words, while I knew I had to focus on the startup I knew that I had to do it by focusing on myself too - in the sense that I needed to be regulating *my precious* self.

Worse is that often the crossroads has no signs — no warning. Steve Blank recounts the illustration of the entrepreneur who is enamored with their idea and does not listen to feedback from the outside world:

> [Colocar aqui a tradução da história do Steve Blank que está dentro do vídeo do map14 Melbourne]

Then it becomes apparent, not always at the critical moment, the rejection of the change of art, or change of one's role and identity — their role, their purpose (or how they see themselves, or how they assess their chances, their self-esteem and self-efficacy). The situation presented by Steve where "no one wants to hear that your baby is ugly" simply stems from the previously formed identity; as if the artist's discovery, even their own (still not revealed) put them in a state of euphoria, of anxiety, with an incredible, creative, and at the same time devastating energy potential.


In another exploration, the entrepreneur maintains the status of their previous discovery, the pre-planned line, even when they go to the streets with the goal of discovering more about the problem/solution, for example, when they go out to conduct research, like listening to their potential customers. The situation is — the entrepreneur returns from "fieldwork," opens the door, and says to their colleagues, "let's pivot!" claiming they heard the "feedback of the galaxies" because someone confirmed their theory, or maybe they were influenced by the pleasure of confirming some hypothesis, or the confirmation that the outlined work yielded positive results.



It's worth reflecting on the various ways this phenomenon presents itself, as it can be toxic, especially in the case of the entrepreneur. For example, a subordinate employee could easily observe this scene and imagine that the entrepreneur is indeed being responsible — after all, the president went to the streets, sought out data, is honoring the relationship with the user, the consumer, the client, with the outside world. He didn’t just create this in his mind. It conveys a strong but dangerous idea.

But probably this speed, this anxiety, or urgency characterizes the entrepreneur who is manipulating the data, or the interpretation of the data, is still reaffirming themselves and worse, believing so much in their own narrative to the point of trying to contaminate their collaborators - ah, the customers said the food needs more salt.

To better articulate this phenomenon, or syndrome, Steve Blank formulated the 72-Hour Rule: the founder is forbidden from returning from the streets and saying "let's pivot" for a period of 72 hours. After 72 hours, they reconsider what they heard.

In order to explore this phenomenon and help teams to see themselves outside their bubble, Steve Blank has formulated what he calls the "72-hour rule," where the founder has to be forbidden to say "let's pivot" for a period of 72 hours from after they come from outside the builting with a great feedback. Steve's point deserves a bit of time more than usual because if we read it too fast, we may miss the point and think that it is a problem with the founder that went out of the building. It is with the team, isn't it? It is the team that is likely supports that founder in the first place, that moves so fast to go with it. It is the team that is anxiously in need for answers or real data. It may well be the team that recognized in the first place how mportant it was to go to the streets first, to help them to stop theorizing, to stop idealizing things. Go founder, go. So when the founder comes back and says, "let's pivot!" it is very much in many circumstances what the team really wants to hear. Therefore, prohibiting the founder to say that is a great advice to a subtle or quiet or fast but anxious inclination from the team to support that founder.

#### Keeping up with passion and humility 

Recovering our theme, we are yet in the context of when things start, looking at the characteristics of the individuals that forms the startup and how that impacts the future of their startup. We can recap that the parties involved might be onto a vision or a calling or you name it but anyway interested in making a new reality - to bring something new to the world. 


But if we think or recognize that complexity, or a fusion of opposite elements, our reaction to that would be so heated reaction  that we might consider it as elementary, and dismiss as not even a topic to be worried. But that does not mean that we are in peace. In the heat of the day, in the average day and in the field, we will feel in a way maybe our subconscious and innocent person inside will fear or sense that the greatest thing in us can be our worse enemy too. In other words, we are not in peace with that happens inside all of us when we sense the paradox of passion, the paradox we all know that take us to love so much to the point of being blind. It is in us, it's inherited. The being not in peace can take us too to pick a side, such as to believe too much in the doer believer, the performant, the achiever. Or to deny the great performant that operates with passion. Perhaps the world moves well because these sides can find each other, these sides marry each other, in business words or other worlds. 



We have then slightly moved away from that idea of a prior vision, and of a totally formed identity of these doers where all that they do can be predicted, towards considering other characteristic factors of the average day, like their passions or motivations. 
That may ot may not yet set us to be concerned with our behaviors from our passions but are certainly the concerns for the gatekeepers of the startup growth - such as investors that want the passionated team but so so much to the point of not being open to feedback and aware of their behaviors. The paradox is then formed if we get to love and hate passion which is better than the blind devotion driven by passion and better than the full denial to passion. This is to be aware. Let us continue.

### The passions of investors  




In a previous chapter, especifically in the section Infinite Apprentice, we have considered the advice from Brian Chesky and Reid Hoffman, the idea of the infinite learner, which brought up the challenges of a leader accross the growth stages. Brian reminded us that is not like one becoming more skilled in an art; and instead it has more to do with having to learn a new sport. Brian, therefore, might be a good example that the infinite apprentice is connected with the an inner and humble spirit that enables transformation.

But then by recognizing the situation of Brian, we should take in the consideration the context too, to force ourselves to recognize what he had revealed too about the network of knowledge and learning how to learn - the idea of accessing the best books would be an element - either people or by great books. 

Also the location and timing - that he and his cofounders were in a space that were considered top-tier, YCombinator, and the eventual connection with Reid Hoffman too. Now notice the complexity as Brian and his team moved up the ladder - having entered YCombinator - and the point where they recognized that YC almost didn't invest.

Another point of view of Bill Draper, one of the early venture capitalists recognized as a founding fathers of Silicon Valley, supports us to see how entrepreneurs are likely to be involved with that they do in a holistic way: 

> *"Being an entrepreneur is very exciting and, as you know, just reading the papers, entrepreneurs around Silicon Valley here are buying the big houses and they're having a lot of fun. It's a lot of work, it's much harder work. I know, it's really hard work to be an entrepreneur, and it's the highest divorce rate in the country, and so you're taking some risks. But if you love what you're doing, and you will because it's your idea and you're pushing it, and for a while nobody's listening, but then eventually you get people to listen. The thing begins to grow, you begin to get proud, and like a little seed that the oak tree grows, and pretty soon you're taking a lot of the credit for what has been built [..] with your ideas and the people you selected in the beginning, but all of a sudden it's much bigger than you ever expected."* (Draper, 2017, 14:27-15:34)

--> 

if we reverse engineer the life cycle by the view given by Bill Draper, it is then inescapable the situation of the journey that started with apparently nothing when no one was listening to them, but later, by the very growth and success achieved, it goes with the logic that people started to listen, and they are therefore involved in that conversation and their performance and now living and interacting with a lot more people who recognize them as successful and so which brings them to believe in their beliefs.

This situation, under the consideration of being positive, make us to think of their fuel, which certainly is especially in the beginning the resource such the founder's time and motivation or the early team's time and energy that keeps them to persevere and navigate the ambiguous and uncertain space ahead. They need to be believers in the first place, and certainly if no passion or connection with factors like a vision - or a mission or a purpose - certainly wouldn't set them to move and would keep them to consider that they are in a boring job and even worse as they don't even get a compensation like a payment. 

But when the situation - as indicated by the "I would do this even for free"  - comes our way, it is then that the early confirmation of our realization that the activities being done produce a feeling of productivity, or safety, or an alignment with a better future, and of a well-being.

Now the concerns with passions influencing the drive is also recognized by the roles that are known as representatives of growth support in the startup growth situation - investors interested in growth. There are likely investors that may bet in passionated teams in a careless way, in a way, such as to a point of allowing them to move fast, with the knowing that potential flaws of passionated drivers will fall apart, as the growth process may take care of itself. In other words, the board can fire the driver later. And that view is not only real because many venture capitalist firms are pressured to grow fast, such as to conquer a given market aside from the means, where acceptable losses fits well the situation such as a founder that moves from a well-being state to a state of not being good to themselves and to the team, or the society. 

But as much as investors are interested in the benefits of passions, the cost of dealing with the negative side of passionated drives, especially when companies are growing, represents a major risk. Therefore, if a professional investor respect the benefits of passions - such as when the team had invested a lot in a domain, such as the team's expertise to make a product or service real - they do so with a risk-oriented mindset; in other words keeping an eye on the destructive force of founders who are enchanted, or too passionated, or in love, to a point of missing elements which are key for growth. In other words, they watch out for when founders tie themselves, such as when they put themselves at risk of disconnection the awareness that is needed to the next stage. This subject is complex precisely because the audience, like the market, is in the future and it is not known where things will go.

In Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital (Stanford, 2013), Howard Hartenbaum a general partner at August Capital, had seen enough interactions with founders to point that even founder's passions and expertise in a given domain - which he recognizes as must have - can become motivators for going full force instead of focusing in the homework and getting involved in checking aspects that could support to reduce the risk to the grow the business. He commented about a situation of a pitch given by founders that were attracted by an idea but missed a major flaw in the business model: 

> *"They didn't grasp the fatal flaw in their business model. This is a perfect example of 'they are gonna go into a space where they lack expertise other than finding it attractive,' they should have gone and found somebody who understood what are the challenges with that specific business, technically, market-wise, customer acquisition, LTV [life time value], all. For most businesses, there are enough similar or identical companies out there that you can learn from when starting a business."* - Howard Hartenbaum (Stanford, 2013, 17:21)

In this sense, the passions of entrepreneurs as seen by investors is also a subject of research, although it is certainly a challenge for researchers to understand the aspects of passions, or to find ways to assess the types of passions that determine more or less success in entrepreneurship. Yet, a window into this space is offered through the quantitative analysis by the research paper by Warnick, Murnieks, McMullen, and Brooks (Warnick, 2018,) which involved asking investors about the types of passions that capture the best investments. The approach in the research had considered the passion for entrepreneurship vs. passion for the product  [^footnote_research_passion_entrepreneurship_product], and its relevancy to investors, which are known traits assumed to be important if a team is interested in materializing innovation in the market. 

[^footnote_research_passion_entrepreneurship_product]: Passion for entrepreneurship have to do with when the founder is aware, interested, engaged, and feels good, with the various aspects involved in the execution the entrepreneurial activities. While passion for the product is oriented to the drive that is motivated by the vision of a product or service. 






Through the research by Bouizegarene et al. (2018), we might respect their intentions to explore how identity processes [^footnote_research_identity_processes] - the things we do that shape our identities - can have an effect in shaping on passions such as to become harmonious and obsessive, and if how that connects with the optimal functioning in society. 

[^footnote_research_identity_processes]: Identity processes refer to dynamics which individuals form, maintain, and develop their sense of self or identity. In the research of Bouizegarene et al. (2018) focuses in two types of identity processes, namely identity integration and identity styles. 

In other words, even if researchers go dig into the specifics and extremmes of driving with passion, their concern sets us to reflect on how we see ourselves, our roles, and how our sense of being in love with what we do  have an effect in our performance, which may sound good, but also on potential narrow views and perspectives.

An interesting finding in the study help us to understand how investors operate with the growth orientation and using a risk analysis mindset, especially being interested in how founders are driven by passion and interested in knowing when passion is too much to the point of the expected growth. In other words, and because of the flipside of being driven passion can be a risk, they interest may related to the theme of openness to feedback. In other words, without such level of awareness a top-tier investor - such as a top-tier angel investor or a top-tier VC partner involved- might be concerned. Therefore, and if we were in the mood of  jumping to conclusions, one can consider that investors check first how passionate entrepreneurs are, and then, secondly or more qualitatively, how much they are open to feedback in ways that they give up their strict views or behaviors driven by passion, which would be an openness to release themselves from what they know. 

In other words, openness to feedback is a crucial element for investors to be able to help entrepreneurs to conquer their next steps. It follows from the research that blind passion, or unrestrained, can manifest as egocentrism, rigidity, or resistance; impacting the non-participation of investors. It is worth remembering that the role of the investor is the risk analyst of the business relationship with the external environment. In other words, a good investor is concerned about whether the entrepreneur is capable of listening to external feedback, as they know that the final word is from the market, or investors, or other gatekeepers of the growth curve. Thus, the role of investors is also a test, a validation, which is compatible with the various other validations such as the market/customers, competition, etc.

It becomes clearer the view that entrepreneurship is science and art, which is born protagonized by entrepreneurs, passionate about art but equally passionate about science, who seek the balance of passions taking into account the connection with the environment where they produce and deliver their creations. Perhaps this formulation helps to explain the tendency of investors to trust more in teams of co-founders than in entrepreneurs who are alone, as probably, except for exceptions, solitary entrepreneurs are more intractable.

I wanted to write, the theme, about the emotions and judgements that can get into the way of the execution of projects. Start-ups, teams, and their constituents are people - they feel, they have emotions. We are also storytellers, and we make sense of what we do with narratives. And, we judge what we do, when we do it in realtime. It`s our natural ability. 

But the focus for this essay is about the life of an entrepreneur that wants to execute projects that demands progression. That is the situation for many. In that context, within this situation, this realm, the situation also has to do with one that seeks to innovate as one wants to break in a market, to call attention of potential users, buyers, stakeholders, partners, and more. 

Therefore, the entrepreneurial goal necessarily involves outcomes to that start-up, team, and one - the constituents -are interested in achieving. In other words, there is discovery. So it comes down to the art and science of progressing onto something that is not guaranteed. 

The complication, in the ocean of many complications, has ties with on one end, the excitement, the vision. Another angle, the expectations, associated with goals (or the outcome after goals). And, on the other hand, the realities in thw world of doing it. The execution with the results in the present will cause reactions from the individuals, which ar part of the teams. Tension comes in play, from the judgement, and analysis and trying to probe the ideas, the methods, the solutions, the market interest, and ones to help. And the jugment comes as narratives. As we have to tell ourselves how we are doing, tell others. We advance by telling. 

Consider the science and art of pitching, for example. When many say that knowing how to pitch matters, and many say, yes it matters. Marc Andreessen, 

> *"I think the formal presentation is another test... As a Founder, if you're not good enough at your job as a CEO to get up and present to an institutional investor, for 60 minutes, and sell them on your thing [, then you are not passing the test]... We love when somebody walks in and has a compelling pitch, and we can give them a check. That's a successful day for us. In contrast, every other pitch you're ever going to make is going to be to somebody who's going to be much worse than us... So customers... are going to be... 'No, I'm not going to give you any money.' Is their default position, right? You know, engineers, you're going to try to recruit... [but] they've got 20 other job offers, right? And so, why is your pitch going to be so much better than the other 20 startups?"* (Andreessen, 2016, 11:49)

<!--

--> 









The point here is that we are being judged by say "another point of view". In other words, judging ourselves all the time - all that we will do. When we craft a pitch, even before it is not shown to other, we do not even show and we read it as if we are a judge, an investors. Poor judgement right? It does not even have anything to do with the real outside world that, in the end of the day, it is going to read, to judge. 

Thus, it is up to us to keep track with methods that can support us to advance, to judge and judge it right, and judge in the right time. One theme in this theme is when to judge for execution of projects. Since a startup acts supposedly faster, things that really complicated as we are moving with specific tasks, when we are acting doing it. 

The focus here I am looking at is activities that be broken, generate poor results, as we judge in realtime. Knowing when to judge is a reflection that I invite you to engage here. And in this regard, we can get help from one of the area that is one of the most complicated fields that involves creativity and execution - an area that when judgement comes into the act of doing, writing. Two ideas, that explores the same point where our conscious judge gets in our way. The goal of these lessons is to spark in us a light, the light of control.

## Driven by social capital 







From the holistic journey that is defined and defines who we think we are - and the considerations that we are driven by passions and motivations - we know that it can take us into success if we we happend to be hyper aware about our passions and motivations, which otherwise we can be trapped up to the point of sinking the startup boat, the team, and even ourselves. 

Now, and assuming that the boat is yet navigating and interested in growing it without pausing in a port of reflection, we shall then be concerned with how the environment will challenge our identities, which may sometimes look like it's a journey of self discovery but in fact we will maintain the consideration that it shapes our identities as entrepreneurs. Especially in this section, by the movement of affairs with affiliations or groups or entities, we will reflect on the development of ourselves is driven by motivations that have ties with these groups such as colleagues, customers, mentors, advisors, and other voices even from systems that now look like what validates our motivations. And in that context, we are interested in how those ties - and with that the motivations and passions - impact our behavior. How that shapes what we do, how we do, even to the point of shaping who we are.

* Outline - Social Capital - Situation - Introducing Social Capital.

I will give you an example. An local accelerator system is a partner that is there to challenge, to motivate, to educate to a certain degree, to leverage the founding team's potential. Some of the accelerator programs, such as early stages, can start with the situation which they recognize as the aspiring founder. They might set the doer in the direction of coming up with 3 ideas in the beginning and then they will have to participate in an event to pitch - in front of judges that in a way represent investor's or the gatekeepers of growth - their best option. This might be just an exercise in the beginning of the program. Thus, they sort of create an artificial acceleration situation with a pressure that is seen as positive. Now, the founding team might well get feedback. In one of the situations that I had participated, I recall from the feedback I had collected before the pitch that my second idea had produced increased level of growth in the pupils of some of the local mentors. The idea had to do with a way for Brazilians to split the bill of the restaurant table more easily. But then, I had decided to move on with a slides platform. Or yet another slides platform. My pitch could not convince the local judges so I got a bad grade and even a punishment exercise for having failed the pitch. 

But some others passed with good scores, and stronger claps too, and I think that they became more tied to that identity. What really changes is that they moved from aspiring entrepreneurs to teams executing a certain idea now supported by the stamp of a program entitled - put that Silicon Valley branded accelerator stamp here. 

It comes from this growth with social capital that not only their identities are shaped but are in a way assumed as critical. It can happen. When they find into it, they perceive as a value, and of course the implied challenge that values can't be taken. Thus, it may be so that they use time to not only seek and join these affairs but also nurture their identities and associations after all it is what protects them. 

And it does so, even so and so that they can also get into trouble. 

> *"Our focus on particular identities can enrich our bonds and make us do many things for each other and can help to take us beyond our self-centered lives. The recent literature on 'social capital,' powerfully explored by Robert Putnam and others, has brought out clearly enough how an identity with others in the same social community can make the lives of all go much better in that community; a sense of belonging to a community is thus seen as a resource - like capital."* (Sen, 2006, p.2) 

<!--

It may be important, therefore, to recognize that the formation, or support for an an identity, hasn't ties with product identity, such as ties associated with the vision. These ties also lies in self-efficacy, self performance, self-esteem, that they develop through the execution. 











<!--

But if looking from above suggests the development of an identity, such as one that gets in the way a wider view, a stronger focus then must go for the actuall challenges of the day, as entrepreneurs do execute from the early stage and do not recognize that they deal with their identities. The reality of the day deals with the struggle where emotions happen and affect reasoning and decisions and even if it shapes entrepreneurial character it does so more silently without an alarm. 

We make calls, we make mistakes - in the context of urgencies, pressures of judgments. We make trouble such as ends. And after post-mortem, we wished we could call us back in time. Or to put in another way, when what we thought were right happen to become a trainwreck, and when all dies, and when we move onn. Suddenly it may be the case that light comes our way, as if the natural post-mortem, now not needed, happens within the space of total freedom, which is indeed enlightening and provokes one to think that "now that I solved all, I can't go back in time" and reason that "my belief was confusing me." They can only then achieve such new insights when they see what they did from a perspective such as a protected space where they can't anymore be in the control of the outcomes, such as when they lost the battle, they are now free from the psychological control. 

The complication is then, in the heat of all that happens, with no clear vision of any identities influencing, they can't separate these emotions, emotions that counts and chimes in, especially in front of projections of judges, and the pressure of time. So the question remains: can the successful entrepreneur separate emotions from ideas like someone who is inside and at the same time outside the hurricane? The answer is yes although it involes the recognition of tolerance for ambiguous situations such as abilities to live inside and outside the reality of what happens. 

<!--

<!--

* Outline - Social Capital - Complication - Robert McKee explains, real life action.
-->




In the battles of the learning and doing, the subject of the identities can be used so that we can reflect about these emotions that in the day drives but with no alarm given; supporting a must reflection as we are generally unable to pause to reflect on what we fell, why we feel, how we are reacting, and if our reaction can be driven by values, such as if emotions driving decisions are triggered from value-systems associated with who they are and their roles. 

According to Robert McKee [1], "In life, if you see a dead body in the street, you are hit by a wave of adrenaline: 'My God, he's dead!' Maybe you run away in fear. Later, when the emotions settle down, you may reflect on the meaning of the death of this stranger, your own mortality, and life under the shadow of death." The truth is that in the face of ups and downs we are emotionally affected because we are human, because we feel. For example, saying no, even to an unwanted type of client, is not so easy if the entrepreneur feels empathy and compassion. In other words, it is not just a simple question of suitability for the business.

When we feel emotions such as insecurity or fear in the situations we experience, we feel them because our brain is defending us: sometimes we even perceive risk situations as if we were being attacked — like trying to flee from a tiger. The idea of losing a client, or even a client meeting that didn't happen (the client needed to cancel), are day-to-day events for the entrepreneur that come in any form, as they are part of the adversities on the battlefield. Thus, our perception determines our emotions and reactions. If we are conditioned with the perception that losing a client is a threat, our brain can trigger an emergency routine and the emotions tallied may be too strong to the point of impacting our performance and our ability to, for example, reflect with the creativity that could eliminate problems.

For McKee, in life, idea and emotion come separately. This view can help us explain the liberating reflection that arises when a former entrepreneur gives up but as soon as they start a new job they can organize their ideas — oh, if they could make a call to their former self or go back in time.

The reality of this modern path for startups can well develop with a certain degree of structure such as the situation of a solo founder that seeks a cofounder in the larger entrepreneurial ecosystem. Or it maybe other kind of resource is is valued and offered by an incubation program. Or to join an accelerator program can be the opportunity. It appears to be the path to the truth when they develop affairs with various kinds of entities of the larger entrepreneurial ecoysystem - spaces that are dynamic, interactive, full of energy and that shows alignment with the need of these founders. In other words, the possibility of affairs with thse external entities becomes the work environment for moving into growth for the startup goals; but also a powerful and rich as it is networked, full of support, full or knowledge, rich in elements that can indeed catapult them up the ladder of growth. With that it comes the implication that as entrepreneurs seek, find, and acquire social capital; they get equally into it, driven by, affected by, which also validates not if they are going in the right direction but materializing who they are. 

In other words, the formation of the founder's identity is slow - as it is not launched out of the sudden as if it is a super hero's identity launched with the product launch - althought it is generally visible through the launches as of course successfyl launches attrach the limelight where all sorts of people are interested in looking at their situation from various perspectives such as to reflect about founder's identity. But in fact the identity formation goes along with the modern approach of entrepreneurship where interactions with entities happen along the way, which also goes well with the lean way of doing entrepreneurship where a lot more happens and where a potential growth ladder exists.

According to Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha (2012), the real estate agent does not know when their next payment will come in because their job is based on highs and lows. So the agent works to sell but also on building their client network which is compatible with constant changes in daily life. It can be said that salespeople and brokers are resilient or even opportunistic. But we can look at the discipline that defines the survival conditions of brokers: they need to create a space to work on ideas isolated from the arrows of emotion, from the adversities of daily life. When the broker sells a big house, they are aware that they cannot be shaken for a longer time. What explains this resilience of sellers, in part, is a preconception inherent in the profession itself: sellers fly over, observe the environment, work in networks, and eventually dive to conquer their prizes. They do not categorize the work of the sale (the conquest of the prize) as being the greater work. For them, what is work is working on the network, flying over, navigating, observing, looking for new directions.

But the day-to-day life of an entrepreneur is different, for unfortunately, emotions do not come with a label that says “beware you are being charmed by emotions!” The reality is that we do not separate emotions from ideas precisely because we are human and because we learn to feel first. The truth is that our humanized version is proof that we were programmed to be occasionally lost.

The question that arises is the dilemma of being an entrepreneur versus being human. Is the successful entrepreneur less human since they manage to better navigate the day-to-day battle? Many become more experienced as they synthesize thoughts based on learning and in the face of daily adversities. And many seem to be more systematic or even colder after so many failures and successes. But these are perceptions that take into account the journey already traveled by those who have made it.

Now, in the field of battles and uncertainties, we need a humanized approach to tread a path that is not as demotivating as “ceasing to be human.”

This path exists thanks also to another human factor, just like feeling. It stems from our human capacity to feel for others. When we look outward, at someone else's problem, we feel, but we feel in a different way with empathy and compassion; very different from living as the protagonist. The humanized version for the entrepreneur is straightforward: we can help other entrepreneurs, especially those who are facing adversities. Even starting from the position of a listener, we are exercising our abilities to observe, listen, reflect, and opine. Moreover, we engage in a “together with them” manner with empathy and compassion for the problem but at the same time know that we are outside the eye of the storm. This approach helps us synthesize ideas without the confusion of emotions that only the protagonist feels. It becomes an exercise that makes us bolder, that creates a more flexible mental model, a perspective; not to mention the help we will be providing to others.

### Cases of roles of an identity 






Every entrepreneur will undertake something with a goal or cause. We reach this stage because we want to change something in the world or achieve a better life. There are motivations and dreams, we already know that. But also, the moment we plant a seed in this terrain, we are not just waiting, but we are shaping our identities as entrepreneurs. So far, so good. The problem, the complication, is that we are in search of support.

Let's reflect on the need to regulate self-esteem, which is natural for people; but how the idea of regulating self-esteem is also tied to an identity that can be invented and is projected as being an identity in the future based on the expectation of success. And how engaging with this identity can lead the entrepreneur to fall into traps that will cost them time; and can actually help to destroy the real identity of the person, the experience, creating frustrations and lack of energy.

In this study, we will first address the case of Myanmar, in which a protagonist, after leaving prison, gains fame that triggers chaos in the nation. This example vividly illustrates how our environment can act as a catalyst in accelerating our identity. In an increasingly digital world, these phenomena occur more frequently and quickly, revealing an alternative reality shaped by the connections we establish and the narratives we create.


Next, we will delve into the implicit issue of identity in entrepreneurship. Through a reflection on this idea of entrepreneurial identity, we seek evidence that identity is not just a phenomenon, but also an essential premise for the act of undertaking. We will also explore the experiences of personalities in the industry, considering inherent risks to this process; that demands a higher degree of consciousness the more we move towards the entrepreneurial trajectory and develop a potential identity.

#### Challenging the superhero





As an example, we can consider the experience of Melissa Nightingale, who shared in her article, "Why it’s a Mistake to be a Startup Superhero" (2016), the danger of trying to be a "superhero" in a startup. During her journey, Melissa found herself so committed to her work that, on one particular night, she stayed in the office late into the night, waiting for colleagues who had been caught in a protest. She was available for any eventuality, whether a call, the need for bail, or the retrieval of equipment. So tired, she improvised a bed with large t-shirts and slept on the office floor.

However, she acknowledges that many of the actions and sacrifices she made, seen as heroic at the time, were not necessary. She was, in a way, a victim of her projected identity. Even if she had a valid belief that she were helping her friends, her colleagues, yet by focusing in that heroic identity she couldn't see that the were using herself as a resource, spending energy, which in the view from above were doing harm to her very colleagues and the whole organization. 

Melissa also highlights in her article how the startup space - she was inspired by the "high tech" space of startusp, encourages a blurring between work and social life. She wrote:  

> *"Tech is particularly good at creating the conditions that normalize this blurry line. Between booze in the office, drinks after work, offsites, outings, and all hands it can feel like a bunch of your social needs are well covered during working hours."* (Nightingale, M., 2016) 

This reinforces that beyond the issue of entrepreneurs' identity, there is also the element of social pressure. The need to be accepted, dedication to work, the feeling of belonging - all these factors can become inducers for one to engage in developing a professional identity, under the needs to perform too. Or it could be said that it goes beyond the necessary and ideal professional identity; but the sad reality is when we are trapped thinking it's a professional identity. It's a challenge to identify when investment in work becomes harmful, not only to us as individuals but also to our collective space, therefore harming collaboration. It is even possible that Melissa from the future would have a hard time to convince Melissa from the past in a call from the future as her past self were not sleeping much, resting as needed, reflecting as needed.

In the book *The Chaos Machine: How Social Networks Reprogrammed Our Mind and Our World*, Max Fisher (2023) recounts the story of a monk named Wirathu, who was catapulted to fame in Myanmar after the country emerged from a long period of isolation and embraced the Internet and social media. Wirathu's rise and his ability to influence a newly connected nation illustrate the intricate relationship between connectivity, identity, and the potentially destructive power of an unchallenged alternate reality.

Wirathu's story begins with a dark past, confined to an environment of hate during his imprisonment. However, his homeland, Myanmar, underwent significant transformations during his detention, including the widespread adoption of the Internet and social media, largely thanks to a partnership with the United States. Inspired by Silicon Valley leaders and former President Barack Obama, Myanmar made a rapid transition to the digital age.

As a result, the Internet - particularly platforms like Facebook and YouTube - became a stage for Wirathu to communicate with followers and increase his influence. According to Fisher, Wirathu enjoyed a popularity that propelled his communication with the world in a way that was unimaginable before the Internet era. Previously, he would have had to travel across the country to spread his words and gain followers.

On social media, however, Wirathu's words were amplified by the users themselves, driving a biased narrative. He "accused the Muslim minority in Myanmar of horrendous crimes, mixing rumors with fabrications" (Fisher, p.55, our translation), generating an alternate reality that became alarmingly mainstream thanks to his celebrity status.

Fisher highlights that the people of Myanmar were introduced to Facebook in an already developed state, creating a kind of digital explosion. Consequently, as users engaged with social media, they built or reinforced their identities. The popularity and echo within the support group became evidence of truth, fueling a confirmation bias that overlooked any counter-argument.

Therefore, users came to interpret the popularity of a post or figure like Wirathu as a validation of their beliefs and perceptions, strengthening their identity while simultaneously creating a cycle of bias confirmation that amplified the alternative narrative. In a notable episode, this dynamic culminated in violent attacks on the Muslim minority, motivated by information spread through social media.

Wirathu and Myanmar's case, as described by Fisher, highlights the power and danger of social media in a newly connected society. What were once unconfirmed fragments of beliefs became, in the digital age, mass validation of an alternative identity and narrative, providing users with a distorted sense of reality and morality. This illustrates the urgency of addressing the spread of misinformation and hatred on social media to ensure a safer and more inclusive digital future.

#### Challenging the critic 



"Aiming for that, I learned to write setting judgment aside and save a polish for later. I canned this new, freer writing "laying track." For the first time I gave myself emotional permission to do rough drafts and for those rough drafts to be, well, rough. " - (Cameron, 1998, p. 19)

Now, another point of view for writing, from the *Art of Non-fiction*, is from Ayn Rand, the philosopher known for objectivism. She pointed that when writing, the act of engaging with editing when doing the first draft is a writing approach that leads to major complications, such as the conscious editor process that messes up with the subconscious that needs to write, to run smooth.

Looking at the writing moment of a writer, and stages, seems to give us a view of how we manage our activities, micro management where a judge comes into our way before. Both, Julia and Ayn Rand, as professional writers, acknowledges the necessity of the critic and editor that does the judgement job, of course. But the real point is when to call it. Julia Cameron added that for the situations that she was able to put her judge aside - "When I went back to polish, I found there wasn't that much to fix or change. A remarkable amount of my first-draft material withstood the test of later scrutinity. " (Cameron, 1998, p. 19)

Therefore, it comes the point for us to reflect, to consider, that we will need to separate progressing from judgement to avoid the drama or confusion to when the actual development is happening.

## Escape hatch  









Many successful entrepreneurs have created companies that have taken new directions and have indeed found happiness in this state of evolution. Not much needs to be said about this because everyone is entitled to live new passions. Moreover, it is not uncommon for art to become mediocre, but the artist is content with the new art once it meets the world. Perhaps this explains authors, like singers, who discover or stumble upon markets and are enchanted with their mediocre works, live moments of fame, live happily, and thus propagate their arts.

However, in this interaction with the world, in the confrontation with changes, the identity created by the entrepreneur also encounters discontentment when it does not evolve and may even die; thus it is perceived, felt, because the creator is co-responsible for their formed identity, their previous work. However, the situation of a major ship - such as of now a grown up startup living its corporate life - the movement or the encourter with what disrupts will provoke the positioning from the executive team and therefore the whole organization. They either embrace or lock the company as an event in time for a reflection.

> *"We still don't know what makes composers. We understand the category of better performers. But founders it is still kind of misterious."* Steve Blank 


> *"Founders fit the definition of a composer: they see something no one else does. And to help them create it from nothing, they surround themselves with world-class performers. This concept of creating something that few others see – and the reality distortion field necessary to recruit the team to build it – is at the heart of what startup founders do. It is a very different skill than science, engineering, or management. Entrepreneurial employees are the talented performers who hear the siren song of a founder’s vision. Joining a startup while it is still searching for a business model, they too see the promise of what can be and join the founder to bring the vision to life. Founders then put in play every skill which makes them unique – tenacity, passion, agility, rapid pivots, curiosity, learning and discovery, improvisation, ability to bring order out of chaos, resilience, leadership, a reality distortion field, and a relentless focus on execution – to lead the relentless process of refining their vision and making it a reality."* (Blank, 2011)

Steve really touches the point of transcendence that embraces possibility, that unlocks the opportunity ahead, and supports the founders to not be trapped by any identity in a given moment, such as to be enamorated with an idea. 

What if, the thought could be turned into as "We are just starting" again. Perhaps that is a way to escape the negative side of the calling. This escape hatch opens the way for growth, for the full realization, and towards leadership. But it isn't easy to see from outside what we do. For that, we need to first acknowledge that it is important - first step - and then with spirit of a true entrepreneur - volunteering to learn - we step up into to find our answers. In a way, the entrepreneur is a generator of an art, it becomes the art in progress in itself, thus she needs to become the curator of its arts.

Is it the person (achievement, musical aptitude, informal musical experiences, formal musical experiences, music self-esteem, academic grades, IQ, and gender?)

### Grown up ship 




As much as I hope that you are reading this book in the paper format, you may be reading it in a e-book device, or in your mobile device, or perhaps your e-dog is reading it to you (Dog: Start laughing joyfully and intensely, then gradually slow down your laughter until it fades away, mimicking the transition from being highly amused to becoming bored or slow.) 

It goes with that whatever electronic device that you are using it that directly or indirectly exists because the evolution and work done by Intel - Intel the iconic Silicon Valley that reigned as a kind of the category known as microprocessor, or the personal computer microprocessor, or the computer's brain when personal computers started to spread around the world. 

Andy Grove, when going through his evolution as a CEO, had given to us great good reflections about the challenges of running a major ship when the waters start to change, when the winds start to change, the winds of competition. 

In this section we will bring the reflection by Andy Grove, the late CEO of Intel, that made an elaboration about the states of emotion of executives driving large organizations in a comparisong with the phases of grief. The recognition of the case of Andy about INtel's challenge to rehink the identity of the executive team, their position, and the theme that Andy brought where they were able to challenge themselves, himself and Gordon, the conversation in the office when they looked at the Great America ferriswheel. 

If we set our time machine to 1985, and land ourselves in the Ferris wheel of the Great America park in Santa Clara California, we would be able to point our binoculars to Intel's headquarters and witness that special conversation between Andy Grove and Gordon Moore, as documented in *Only The Paranoid Survive*, the conversation that marks a moment of transcendence from Intel management that took them to "The bold decision to commit Intel’s future to microprocessors," [^foonote_hbr_intel_1996] which brought Intel a major transformation to the world, that consumers get that Intel meant the computer's brains: 

[^foonote_hbr_intel_1996]: The article from HBR titled "Inside Intel" by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff (1996), underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of industry crises and technological shifts. In essence, the article considers Intel's journey through significant challenges, including the competitive pressure from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers in the mid-1980 which led to a strategic pivot from memory chips to microprocessors, and how the success from transformation brings new challenges, like a totally new game or sport where the organization has to transcend in order to survive.  

> *"I remember a time in the middle of 1985, after this aimless wandering had been going on for almost a year. I was in my office with Intel's chairman and CEO, Gordon Moore, and we were discussing our quandary. Our mood was downbeat. I looked out the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance, then I turned back to Gordon and asked, 'If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?' Gordon answered without hesitation, 'He would get us out of memories.' I stared at him, numb, then said, "Why shouldn't you and I walk out the door, come back and do it ourselves?'"* (Grove, A., 1999, p. 89)

### Viewpoints from the historical flights 







<!-- 

The following whole section is from https://medium.com/startup-check-in/let-there-be-light-our-ancestor-entrepreneurs-and-your-next-startup-ideas-cc64c4573bb8 

--> 

When Patrick Collison was invited to talk about his fast-growing company at the Technology-enabled Blitzscaling classes, instructor John Lilly pointed out that “he walked in with a book made of paper, which is always very exciting.” Further down the interview, John wonders why he has so much interest in history.

For Patrick, it’s a way to cheat. Everyone else ignores all the good ideas from history, and so you can just be much smarter by just, you know — you could just try to think all these incredibly original thoughts by sort of sitting down and staring at the wall for days on end — or you can sort of cheat by just, you know, I mean they are, in fact, written down in books that you can just read. (Patrick Collison — Greylock Partners, 2015, 11:17)

Patrick’s point almost passed without myself noticing what is so special. But it turns out that I was reading an amazing history book - The Power Makers, by historian Maury Klein - at the time, which helped me to reflect and consider why entrepreneurs should read about history such as history of technology, history of entrepreneurs, and more. 

When great historians drag us back in time, they help us better understand how factors, such as the external environment, such as period and the cultural environment, have an effect in entrepreneur’s decisions and goals. It’s like you are transported into the protagonists but also giving the protection so that you are not lost like a protagonist. The protection is the space of opportunity to reflect about the currents of the time, the factors influencing, challenges, and more. 

It provoke us into questioning things like what brings us to come up with ideas? Is it pain? Or love? Or a major obstacle on their way? Is it a vision or an epiphany, after he had long years of thinking and living through challenges first-hand? What made them pursue a life of entrepreneurship? what factors contributes for us to persevere for decades?

Connecting the dots leading to innovation. The view from above, or from the cockpit with a narrator using the time capsule, might also give us the view of hot the dots are connected, for how inventors bring their ideas to market: from the background, to how the idea first appeared, moving to how they evolved into an early product, showing the potential pitfalls or how ideas are brought to the market.

It’s like a view from the above that conciliates how external factors are influential to entrepreneurship. What pitfalls we can find? What obstacles appears in front of us? What are the conditions that can favor the further development of our goals? Will the environment be friendly in the short, medium and long run?

It’s great to learn about successes. But historians will also tell you about the failures; and more, the failures of first movers, such as the life and death of inventors and entrepreneurs that could not bring their ideas as they have envisioned, and the potential later realization, by others, of what those first movers had envisioned. This level of contrast help entrepreneurs to better understand a macro view for how inventors and inventions correlate and collaborate in the long run and the leadership compoment that mad things to become real. 

Consider the situation of John Fitch which is credited as one of the inventors of the commercial steamboat service. His product, Perseverance, was launched in 1790 as a commercial steamboat service but didn't do well and was abandoned. 15 years later, as history shows, a successfully implemented solution was brought by Robert Fulton, that was a bit less inventor and more of an assembler and able to focus on the service. 
 
> *“Fitch advertised the service heavily and the boat performed admirably — going five hundred miles before suffering mechanical problems — but the passengers did not come. In desperation, the partners offered free food and drinks on board, but every voyage continued to lose money. What had proven to be technological triumph turned out to be a commercial failure, and the service was abandoned after that first summer. His investors backed away, and Fitch eventually found himself nearly penniless once again.”* (Klein, 2009, p. 46)

Reading how amazing inventions were born helps us soften our minds and better recognize how much biased we are, how humble we should be. Consider the situation of Ampere and Coulomb which were convicted about the lack of relationship between electricity and magnetism, leading to the general acceptance that no relationship existed between these areas. Such belief persisted for about 20 years, when suddenly however an unknown professor hits a discovery by chance: It was during an experiment with his students when professor Oersted were melting wires and noticed that a compass moved every time the electricity was being turned on/off.

After such discovery Oersted published a paper. While Ampere priorly did not believe in such relationship, this was a real experiment, therefore easy to replicate. From that moment, Ampere not only accepted but he immediately started contributing to this new field in a matter of two months.

In the above passage, new opportunities appeared after that irrefutable observation of effects of the physical world, enabling the status-quo of scientists to be dropped quickly. They other words, they had to accept change as their environment was changing. 

Productizing an idea depends on many factors such as vision and engineering capacity. But it won’t necessarily mean your target customer is ready to accept the proposed and envisioned product. And even if they are, it does not mean that all the forces in the future will favor your product to enter and sustain itself in the market.

### Changing goggles 





For closing, we shall consider the very situation of growth for the business, or the need for growth, that can be used as a way to shock-aborb any potential interpretations and characterization of how founders are conducting. The experimentation, or exercise, of transcending and doing analysis of the business for the future, which will likely set the theme of tops-down needs, taken from vision and higher-order goals, objectives, which will embrace the development of the business, may be a good exercise to put the present execution under a degree of scrutinity.

For Michael Dearing, lecturer and investor at Harrison Metal, founders should evaluate themselves and understand the differences between coming up with an insight, developing a product, and developing a whole business:

> *"First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to, hopefully God willing, turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)

### Revisiting our identities 






It should, then, be considered, that the attachment with certain groups, or entities, and even frameworks and tools - which are by the way not only connected but also empowered by communities, can be the very things that set us to then be supported by social representations which may support us to understanding that feeding that current identity is alive or doing well or that it can be promising. So this might be simply our operating system running its normal and efficient process which under the checked concrete values we found which may be associated with behavior we then feed our own profecies but if that is too far then at least a sign that we are in right direction. From the sake of the actual behaviours - which is what counts for us - it might be then the materialization of a characterization of identity, or a formation of it, for the doer that engages with that practice, and with that the implication of identity attachment, which in itself acts as value, therefore it becomes valued as the things we take that we cannot lose or that when under attack we may react to preserve which may become strongly than the general things perceived as necessary. 

When I explore the case of tools and systems - it might be confusing - so it deserves some elaboration. I mean that one that is skilled with a tool and by the using it had achieved success - by the eyes of whoever are the eyes that supports his motivations and developments - will then see herself as an skilled in that tool. When I was going through the struggle phase in my career as a writer (which I believe might be one of my identities now) it happened that ChatGPT was launched by OpenAI. I found fascinating that I could ask the tool - or system - with a degree of innocence and put up some bits and pieces of logic and asked it to produce an article and even pointed a logic of storytelling to the points of the article. I happened to publish a couple of these articles in an online publication and even gotten promoted - achieved a higher-rank as a writer. To defend myself I wasn't cheating and actually developed quite well an interaction with the tool that led me to a much better article. But then, at the same time I found another trouble from that. I was out of the sudden, given that raise or promotion, passionated or feeling movitated of myself as someone like a composer being able to tell the robot to engage in many specific activities. I was feeling like an expert in the science and art of taming the robot to come up with better articles. Then, the move I evolved into the movement I also caught myself struggling, and being a bit confused, or to working for the robot too or being influenced by its words too. Through my interactions when I was yet promoting the robot's amazing work - and with that my abilty to control it - I happened to share thoughts about my discoveries with a great writer. At some point, she told me to "not make a dance or song about a simple activity." She has told me to "think it through.". And she reminded me that my brain is the tool. That, along with a permission from Julia Cameron - from The Right to Write - a permission to write with errors and setting my critic-editor aside (as we have covered) I started to do what writers do and the rest is history, I wrote for one year almost every day and was able to complete the book. Lessons taken: I have left the position of thinking that I was a master of that tool. The tool had helped me in the book too. For example, I have asked the tool to check citations, to write some of the footnotes, and many other creative usages that really editors do, even to make abstracts of my chapters so that I could check if the tool was able to understand my points - like a reader. But I didn't fall in the trap of thinking I were the champion or a master of the tool, a master like any master that becomes the slave by living the position of a master which is essentially a trap of being a controller. 

And by that, as discussed, the attachment with such identity, or identities, may be assumed to be a source of greater value although which may not be true, just like a human may enjoy the perceived benefits of an inclusion in a given group but that does not give the final answer of who that person is, or better, who they are ought to become, and in fact may even harm that person's path as they represent, they act, they are directed in their reasoning, and directed in their decision, which may harm their self development path, their true aspirations, the formation of who they are to become. A supporting line to this general idea can be guided by the enlighted line of thinking of Amarthya Sen in Identity and Violence: 

> *"In our normal lives, we see ourselves as members of a variety of groups - we belong to all of them. A person's citizenship, residence, geographic origin, gender, class, politics, profession, employment, food habits, sports interestsm taste in music, social commitments, etc., make us members of a variety of groups. Each of these collectivities, to all of which this person simultaneously belongs, gives her a particular identity. None of them can be taken to be the person's only identity or singular membership category." (Sen, 2006, p.2)
