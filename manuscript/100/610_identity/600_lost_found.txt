Now, and inline with the concerns of our chapter, perhaps I were too fast into being worried about them changing my title; and which goes along with my same self that were too fast in a situation when I were waiting in the line of the movie theather in Mountain View, California, in 2001: 

> *"When I were living in Silicon Valley, our team got tickets to watch a special movie. The line was filled with nerds from our team from the iconic company widely known at the time - Netscape. Then a person moved towards me on rollers and holding some little shiny thing and apparently said that 'one ring rule them all' to which I rapidly said 'no, thanks!'. I wasn't interested in buying anything. I wanted to see the movie. Only later, after watching *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, I fully realized that the dude wasn't a salesperson trying to sell anything. He had a ring in his hands and wanted to hand me. "* Marcio

Consider the situation pointed by Brad Feld in Up Starts that company cab yellow X didn't accept the offer from Sequoia capital:

It can be tricky to know what is really going on, and this sets founders into the need to reflect, to try to see all from above. There will be no full answers. Had that CEO done right?

Andy Grove, in Only the Paranoid Survive (1999), explains a critical situation - he had referred as an strategic inflection point - that can be experienced by leadership teams of large companies. This inflection point is when a stabilized company, which has a product or service well established in the market, encounters a force that disrupts the equilibrium of the product or service. Most companies experiencing inflection points simply do not survive because the acting forces impacts them brutally. One can imagine the entity-company, on the sunny beach, when the waves start to change but the tsunami that is coming is not perceived. In these moments, sometimes decades before the tsunami, management teams experience sensations as difficult as those people feel when they loss a loved one — such as to defend their positions, to deny the early signs. 

> *"If you are a senior manager, you probably got to where you are because you have devoted a large portion of your life to your trade, to your industry and to your company. In many instances, your personal identity is inseparable from your lifework. So, when your business gets into serious difficulties, in spite of the best attempts of business schools and management training courses to make you a rational analyzer of data, objective analysis will take second seat to personal and emotional reactions almost every time."* (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 123-124)

Now if we stick with their journey, call them entrepreneurs or artists, we can narrow our theme by asking if who they are - by the how they do in the what they do - influences themselves, their colleagues, and the future of their startups. Thus we can be concerned with the implications caused by the few that happens to start a journey of execution. With that, one issue has to do with the concerns if their behaviors can influence their startup growth, for good or bad, and themselves as citizens, and with that their well-being, for good or bad. Moreover, we should be concerned with their behavior, or characteristics or perceived identity, that rises from the entrepreneurial journey that happens to be influenced by the situation of their startups seeking growth. Thus, they shape and are shaped by their environment as they climb up a ladder of social capital, because they grab the attention and energy from their social environment, because of their affiliations, or agreements, or affairs, with groups that are valued as great supporters. And by that they essentially feed their identities which feeds back their organizations. From that, it rises the complicated possibility that they find themselves trapped, with the assumptions, with their behaviors, with the models that they use to answer new questions, with being supported by their own romantic notions or the support from what appears to be evidence. So they sometimes cannot let go, as they can't lose what they have, especially when what they have seems to be who they are. 


> *"Many communitarian thinkers tend to argue that a dominant communal identity is only a matter of self-realization, not of choice. It is, however, hard to believe that a person really has no choice in deciding what relative importance to attach to the various groups to which he or she belongs, and that she must just 'discover' her identities, as if it were a purely natural phenomenon ( like determining whether it is day or night). In fact, we are all constantly making choices, if only implicitly, about the priorities to be attached to our different affiliations and associations. "* (Sen, 2006, p. 5)

SOme comparison with artists, and attempt to suggest that they navigate with a bit chaotic but as good artists they leave chaos, transcend, find something they are more tuned to, and which also goes along with the validation from audiences. 

A successful entrepreneur can be likened to an artist, in the sense of being successful in bringing a vision, a creation, to the world. However, the opposite is not true because not every artist reveals art to the world. This is because art remains art even when it is contained, incubated, when it is not flying - the artist does not cease to be an artist while learning. On the other hand, the artist-in-the-eyes-of-the-world works on refining their idea, so that their art makes sense to them and at the same time to their audience. Even though they often go through chaotic navigation, the good artist ceases to be chaotic as they build their identity and their work, their work; an identity that embraces and is embraced by the audience, perhaps not directly but as an audience confirms the production, then it is believed that that identity gives rise to the embraced product, that is, the identity is validated.

* Answer - Situation - User innovation what? #MIT #EricHippel

Entrepreneurship is an activity that involves not only a commercial motivation but also a passion for a cause that one wishes to see changed. This motivation is central in the phenomenon of "User Innovation," where the entrepreneur finds themselves intrinsically linked to the cause they advocate. Both the work of Eric von Hippel in "Democratizing Innovation" (2005) and the course "User Innovation: A Path to Entrepreneurship" on MITx on edX emphasize this premise, highlighting that "innovation often starts with real people solving their own problems" (MIT, 2015). This concept encourages entrepreneurs to deeply engage with the causes they support, fueling both their passion and their motivation to create innovative and disruptive solutions.

As indicated in this video introduction to the course, inventions like basketball, braille, among others, and even technological solutions like Dropbox, were inventions generally emerged from the real people who lives through their challenges first hand [^footnote_edx_userinnovation]. In other words, personal causes. This premise, in the view of Eric von Hippel, is everywhere and is a phenomenon.

[^footnote_edx_userinnovation]: The short introductory video for the MIT course entitled *User Innovation: A Path to Entrepreneurship* (2015, May 19), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpBSY9_RyCg, contextualizes the phenomenon of User Innovation that is explored in the work of MIT professor Eric von Hippel.
