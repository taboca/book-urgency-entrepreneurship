In a previous chapter, especifically in the section Infinite Apprentice, we have considered the advice from Brian Chesky and Reid Hoffman, the idea of the infinite learner, which brought up the challenges of a leader accross the growth stages. Brian reminded us that is not like one becoming more skilled in an art; and instead it has more to do with having to learn a new sport. Brian, therefore, might be a good example that the infinite apprentice is connected with the an inner and humble spirit that enables transformation.

But then by recognizing the situation of Brian, we should take in the consideration the context too, to force ourselves to recognize what he had revealed too about the network of knowledge and learning how to learn - the idea of accessing the best books would be an element - either people or by great books. 

Also the location and timing - that he and his cofounders were in a space that were considered top-tier, YCombinator, and the eventual connection with Reid Hoffman too. Now notice the complexity as Brian and his team moved up the ladder - having entered YCombinator - and the point where they recognized that YC almost didn't invest.

#### Projected from the eyes of the beholders 



I wanted to write, the theme, about the emotions and judgements that can get into the way of the execution of projects. Start-ups, teams, and their constituents are people - they feel, they have emotions. We are also storytellers, and we make sense of what we do with narratives. And, we judge what we do, when we do it in realtime. It`s our natural ability. 

But the focus for this essay is about the life of an entrepreneur that wants to execute projects that demands progression. That is the situation for many. In that context, within this situation, this realm, the situation also has to do with one that seeks to innovate as one wants to break in a market, to call attention of potential users, buyers, stakeholders, partners, and more. 

Therefore, the entrepreneurial goal necessarily involves outcomes to that start-up, team, and one - the constituents -are interested in achieving. In other words, there is discovery. So it comes down to the art and science of progressing onto something that is not guaranteed. 

The complication, in the ocean of many complications, has ties with on one end, the excitement, the vision. Another angle, the expectations, associated with goals (or the outcome after goals). And, on the other hand, the realities in thw world of doing it. The execution with the results in the present will cause reactions from the individuals, which ar part of the teams. Tension comes in play, from the judgement, and analysis and trying to probe the ideas, the methods, the solutions, the market interest, and ones to help. And the jugment comes as narratives. As we have to tell ourselves how we are doing, tell others. We advance by telling. 

Consider the science and art of pitching, for example. When many say that knowing how to pitch matters, and many say, yes it matters. Marc Andreessen, 

> *"I think the formal presentation is another test... As a Founder, if you're not good enough at your job as a CEO to get up and present to an institutional investor, for 60 minutes, and sell them on your thing [, then you are not passing the test]... We love when somebody walks in and has a compelling pitch, and we can give them a check. That's a successful day for us. In contrast, every other pitch you're ever going to make is going to be to somebody who's going to be much worse than us... So customers... are going to be... 'No, I'm not going to give you any money.' Is their default position, right? You know, engineers, you're going to try to recruit... [but] they've got 20 other job offers, right? And so, why is your pitch going to be so much better than the other 20 startups?"* (Andreessen, 2016, 11:49)

--> 









The point being is that we are being judged by say "another point of view". In other words, judging ourselves all the time - all that we will do. When we craft a pitch, even before it is not shown to other, we do not even show and we read it as if we are a judge, an investors. Poor judgement right? It does not even have anything to do with the real outside world that, in the end of the day, it is going to read, to judge. 

Thus, it is up to us to keep track with methods that can support us to advance, to judge and judge it right, and judge in the right time. One theme in this theme is when to judge for execution of projects. Since a startup acts supposedly faster, things that really complicated as we are moving with specific tasks, when we are acting doing it. 

The focus here I am looking at is activities that be broken, generate poor results, as we judge in realtime. Knowing when to judge is a reflection that I invite you to engage here. And in this regard, we can get help from one of the area that is one of the most complicated fields that involves creativity and execution - an area that when judgement comes into the act of doing, writing. Two ideas, that explores the same point where our conscious judge gets in our way. The goal of these lessons is to spark in us a light, the light of control.

#### Challenging the critic 



"Aiming for that, I learned to write setting judgment aside and save a polish for later. I canned this new, freer writing "laying track." For the first time I gave myself emotional permission to do rough drafts and for those rough drafts to be, well, rough. " - (Cameron, 1998, p. 19)

Now, another point of view for writing, from the *Art of Non-fiction*, is from Ayn Rand, the philosopher known for objectivism. She pointed that when writing, the act of engaging with editing when doing the first draft is a writing approach that leads to major complications, such as the conscious editor process that messes up with the subconscious that needs to write, to run smooth.

--> 

Looking at the writing moment of a writer, and stages, seems to give us a view of how we manage our activities, micro management where a judge comes into our way before. Both, Julia and Ayn Rand, as professional writers, acknowledges the necessity of the critic and editor that does the judgement job, of course. But the real point is when to call it. Julia Cameron added that for the situations that she was able to put her judge aside - "When I went back to polish, I found there wasn't that much to fix or change. A remarkable amount of my first-draft material withstood the test of later scrutinity. " (Cameron, 1998, p. 19)

Therefore, it comes the point for us to reflect, to consider, that we will need to separate progressing from judgement to avoid the drama or confusion to when the actual development is happening.

## Reflection on identity vs. Ayn rand 

* Gpt on ayn rand and identity of founders 
* Ref https://chat.openai.com/share/c02f7bc3-46cf-42a7-b4d7-471e9fa00a41

```
The excerpts from Ayn Rand's work emphasize the fundamental principle of identity, encapsulated in the axiom "A is A," which asserts that to exist is to be something specific, with distinct characteristics that define its nature. This concept of identity is central not just to understanding existence but also to the foundation of knowledge, ethics, and purposeful action in Rand's philosophy. When considering the meaning of identity for founders—entrepreneurs and creators who initiate new ventures or ideas—this principle offers profound implications for how they should approach their endeavors and understand their role in the world.

The Importance of Identity for Founders
Clarity of Vision: For a founder, having a clear, unambiguous understanding of what they and their venture are—and, just as critically, what they are not—is essential. This clarity of identity informs every aspect of the venture, from its core mission and values to its market positioning and brand messaging. A founder must recognize and embrace the specific nature of their venture, ensuring that its identity aligns with their vision and values.

Consistency of Purpose: The law of identity underscores the importance of consistency in action and purpose. A founder must ensure that their actions and the actions of their venture consistently reflect its identity. This means making decisions and pursuing goals that are in harmony with the venture's nature and objectives, avoiding contradictions that could undermine its integrity and credibility.

Innovation and Value Creation: Rand's emphasis on the identity of a thing being defined by its specific attributes encourages founders to focus on what unique value their venture brings to the market. Innovation is not about denying the venture's identity but about expressing and enhancing it in new, creative ways. Founders should seek to innovate within the framework of their venture's identity, leveraging its unique characteristics to offer something of distinct value to their customers.

Moral Integrity: The rebellion against identity is, in Rand's view, a wish for non-existence. For a founder, this translates into the ethical imperative to embrace and uphold the venture's identity with integrity. This means not only being true to the venture's founding principles but also resisting pressures to compromise on its core identity for expedient gains. The founder's moral integrity is reflected in the integrity of the venture itself.

Realistic Goals and Expectations: Acknowledging and respecting the law of identity allows founders to set realistic goals and expectations for their venture. Understanding the nature and limits of what their venture is and can do enables founders to pursue achievable objectives, assess risks more accurately, and plan more effectively for growth and development.

Adaptation Within Identity: While the law of identity asserts that a thing is itself, this does not preclude adaptation and growth within the context of its identity. Founders should be open to evolving their venture's expression of its identity as they learn and as the market changes, always ensuring that such evolution is coherent with the venture's core nature.

In essence, for founders, embracing the concept of identity as elucidated by Ayn Rand involves a commitment to clarity, consistency, innovation, integrity, realism, and adaptive growth—all grounded in a deep understanding of what their venture is at its core. This approach not only guides the venture's strategic direction but also serves as a moral compass for the founder, ensuring that their creation remains true to its essence as it navigates the challenges of the market.

## Excerpt from Andrew Chen @ a16z

* Ref - https://andrewchen.com/how-to-break-into-silicon-valley/

* About - When Andrew talked about networking conversations in Silicon Valley, he made a good case for how "a thing" as in "a special thing" is a necessary thing for get a conversation going in a place like Silicon Valley. I recall the days when I left being full-time for a Silicon Valley company but went back and how cool it were to make connections having something "in the works." People would value you if you were onto something and that valuing seemed to go both ways - they were making a judgemnt for what you are doing, and I on the other end, making a connection and quality conversation that could be supporting; minimally keeps motivation high. Consider the point about the need to have an interesting quest as a factor of necessity for the audience: " I encourage you to be on a quest of your own, and even better a particularly interesting quest, so that your conversations with people can be as productive as possible." 

```
"Having a “thing”
That said, the conversations are more productive when you have “a thing.” What I mean by that is that all of these conversations and networking are more useful when you are starting a company, creating a new podcast, are working on a new project or book, or something else. When you have a directed goal in mind, then the conversations often are more valuable for all parties involved, because you were making yourself an expert in a particular area and your questions are more relevant. Otherwise you will surely encounter very busy people who simply refuse to “grab coffee” to “catch up” because it’s a poor use of time. I encourage you to be on a quest of your own, and even better a particularly interesting quest, so that your conversations with people can be as productive as possible.

In my case, I was very interested in the state of the art on growing users, metrics, network effects, and marketing. I asked everyone about this topic, and began to develop my own ideas that I would share freely. Eventually, it became clear that a few small communities orienting the PayPal mafia were the furthest along in their thinking. And that’s how I ended up being exposed first to concepts like retention curves, DAU/MAU, viral loops, and so on.

These ideas were interest to me, because my professional experience leading up to that point was actually an adtech. I had previously worked in online ads, with customers from WSJ, CBS, MySpace, etc, and had even gotten a patent filed on ad targeting (yes, US7747676B1). I had a superpower in my domain knowledge of CAC, A/B testing, funnel optimization, lead gen, etc, and began to merge all of this thinking with consumer products. In 2007 this was cutting edge at a time when product success was often measured by vanity metrics such as the total registrations for a product. This bit of specialized knowledge was what I brought to the table, and I talked about some of those learnings and ideas, and how they might apply to products. Sometimes I’d get intros to interesting people simply because of this expertise, which I appreciated."

Now, and inline with the concerns of our chapter, perhaps I were too fast into being worried about them changing my title; and which goes along with my same self that were too fast in a situation when I were waiting in the line of the movie theather in Mountain View, California, in 2001: 

> *"When I were living in Silicon Valley, our team got tickets to watch a special movie. The line was filled with nerds from our team from the iconic company widely known at the time - Netscape. Then a person moved towards me on rollers and holding some little shiny thing and apparently said that 'one ring rule them all' to which I rapidly said 'no, thanks!'. I wasn't interested in buying anything. I wanted to see the movie. Only later, after watching *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, I fully realized that the dude wasn't a salesperson trying to sell anything. He had a ring in his hands and wanted to hand me. "* Marcio

Andy Grove, in Only the Paranoid Survive (1999), explains a critical situation - he had referred as an strategic inflection point - that can be experienced by leadership teams of large companies. This inflection point is when a stabilized company, which has a product or service well established in the market, encounters a force that disrupts the equilibrium of the product or service. Most companies experiencing inflection points simply do not survive because the acting forces impacts them brutally. One can imagine the entity-company, on the sunny beach, when the waves start to change but the tsunami that is coming is not perceived. In these moments, sometimes decades before the tsunami, management teams experience sensations as difficult as those people feel when they loss a loved one — such as to defend their positions, to deny the early signs. 

> *"If you are a senior manager, you probably got to where you are because you have devoted a large portion of your life to your trade, to your industry and to your company. In many instances, your personal identity is inseparable from your lifework. So, when your business gets into serious difficulties, in spite of the best attempts of business schools and management training courses to make you a rational analyzer of data, objective analysis will take second seat to personal and emotional reactions almost every time."* (Grove, A., 1999, pp. 123-124)

Now if we stick with their journey, call them entrepreneurs or artists, we can narrow our theme by asking if who they are - by the how they do in the what they do - influences themselves, their colleagues, and the future of their startups. Thus we can be concerned with the implications caused by the few that happens to start a journey of execution. With that, one issue has to do with the concerns if their behaviors can influence their startup growth, for good or bad, and themselves as citizens, and with that their well-being, for good or bad. Moreover, we should be concerned with their behavior, or characteristics or perceived identity, that rises from the entrepreneurial journey that happens to be influenced by the situation of their startups seeking growth. Thus, they shape and are shaped by their environment as they climb up a ladder of social capital, because they grab the attention and energy from their social environment, because of their affiliations, or agreements, or affairs, with groups that are valued as great supporters. And by that they essentially feed their identities which feeds back their organizations. From that, it rises the complicated possibility that they find themselves trapped, with the assumptions, with their behaviors, with the models that they use to answer new questions, with being supported by their own romantic notions or the support from what appears to be evidence. So they sometimes cannot let go, as they can't lose what they have, especially when what they have seems to be who they are. 


> *"Many communitarian thinkers tend to argue that a dominant communal identity is only a matter of self-realization, not of choice. It is, however, hard to believe that a person really has no choice in deciding what relative importance to attach to the various groups to which he or she belongs, and that she must just 'discover' her identities, as if it were a purely natural phenomenon ( like determining whether it is day or night). In fact, we are all constantly making choices, if only implicitly, about the priorities to be attached to our different affiliations and associations. "* (Sen, 2006, p. 5)

SOme comparison with artists, and attempt to suggest that they navigate with a bit chaotic but as good artists they leave chaos, transcend, find something they are more tuned to, and which also goes along with the validation from audiences. 

A successful entrepreneur can be likened to an artist, in the sense of being successful in bringing a vision, a creation, to the world. However, the opposite is not true because not every artist reveals art to the world. This is because art remains art even when it is contained, incubated, when it is not flying - the artist does not cease to be an artist while learning. On the other hand, the artist-in-the-eyes-of-the-world works on refining their idea, so that their art makes sense to them and at the same time to their audience. Even though they often go through chaotic navigation, the good artist ceases to be chaotic as they build their identity and their work, their work; an identity that embraces and is embraced by the audience, perhaps not directly but as an audience confirms the production, then it is believed that that identity gives rise to the embraced product, that is, the identity is validated.

Entrepreneurship is an activity that involves not only a commercial motivation but also a passion for a cause that one wishes to see changed. This motivation is central in the phenomenon of "User Innovation," where the entrepreneur finds themselves intrinsically linked to the cause they advocate. Both the work of Eric von Hippel in "Democratizing Innovation" (2005) and the course "User Innovation: A Path to Entrepreneurship" on MITx on edX emphasize this premise, highlighting that "innovation often starts with real people solving their own problems" (MIT, 2015). This concept encourages entrepreneurs to deeply engage with the causes they support, fueling both their passion and their motivation to create innovative and disruptive solutions.

As indicated in this video introduction to the course, inventions like basketball, braille, among others, and even technological solutions like Dropbox, were inventions generally emerged from the real people who lives through their challenges first hand [^footnote_edx_userinnovation]. In other words, personal causes. This premise, in the view of Eric von Hippel, is everywhere and is a phenomenon.
