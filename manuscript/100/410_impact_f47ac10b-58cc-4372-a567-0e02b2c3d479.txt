Tati Ferreira, do canal AcidezFeminina, perguntou em um debate durante as eleições de 2018 — "Se todo esse dinheiro que fosse desviado tivesse sido investido no estado, a gente teria um cenário diferente? Eu acho que todo mundo já se perguntou isso eu não sei se vocês tem as respostas."

Eduardo Oinegue respondeu "Definitivamente não. Se você pegasse todo o dinheiro da corrupção e aplicasse em políticas públicas, você não teria efeito nenhum em políticas públicas. Mas, mas, a energia que esses gestores gastam, para montar a estrutura de corrupção é um tempo que eles não gastam resolvendo os problemas da sociedade." e concluiu que "ao não trabalharem para a sociedade, é como se a sua resposta fosse sim, porque eles estão dedicados aos deles e não ao nosso, como sociedade."

This deeper reflection on the true cost of corruption, can be an invitation for us to consider the management of the activities in any entrepreneurial effort. It tells us that we need to execute with consciousness to the business of entrepreneurship, which logically starts with the implied notion that the time we invest in one thing is time we aren't dedicating to other things; but the reason that this matters, especially for entrepreneurs is that it connects with the idea expressed by Reid Hoffman which is key to the scaling needs in the startup ground which is "What brought you here is not what takes you there:" 

> *""* Reid Hoffman,

Now, the celebration of that truth in entrepreneurship unlocks a complication. That is what means there and the how to get there? And it becomes quite complicated because if the team is small, consider that many startups started with one before the other, and especially if vision - or love or passion or you name it - is present, it is naturally expected a kind of vision that creates a roadmap for the there which naturally pushes them to gamble since "what got you here won't get you there" revels that they might be in seeking the objective as much as the how to get to the objective. Thus the complication prompts us to find what is the key that unlocks the self into being open so that to be aware, to embrace the unknown, such as developing ways to balancing the activities, for what it takes to get to there, to which only really after the movement happens one can truly say, in retrospect, how to get there. 

To solve the problem, which is likely impossible from the view of the executor of now, we might consider to resort in developing a humble view for what happens. Thus, first, we will recognize what we are experiencing, as executors of entrepreneurship, is a drive with intents, and the complex art of dealing with being efficient. The second aspect, after the recognition of the condition, involves being compassionate with your other self, the self that does not know, the self that is the only self that can let you escape from trouble, and enter learning, or the state of bring an apprentice which links to the state of the infinite learner that we have touched upon in the very first chapter. 

### How we experience the performer 

Consider a founder that focuses so much the engineering of a prototype that does not open space to strategize that she will need to let it go, so to consider the aspects necessary to turn that project into an innovation in the real world. As an example, consider the one that puts out fires as she fears not doing to entirely, mainly, will create other problems for the future of the organization. Thus, the belief would be of - if I let the fire spread, I will lose the entire thing. In other words, actions without strategy can lead to a routine of execution that doesn't address the deeper issues, or better, higher-order issues. 

Here is where anyone will easily consider the idea of urgent versus important and the idea that continuing as in performing might support the self to the denial of the analysis of what is being done, and any impact. We might be enchanted, following an illusion of productivity. Perhaps at some point, entrepreneurs shift from being proactive to reactive, or proactive in a realm of an specific activity or concern, which would mean not being proactive from other points of view. As an example, consider that they begin to tend to what's "in the air," such as what's working with customers, to responding to demands, or to comply with an effort that seems to show results ahead, something that is relevant and commendable, for execution is important.

Another point of view to open the analysis of the situation can be appreciated if we think of a founder that focuses so much the engineering of a prototype that does not open space to strategize that she will need open time to consider the aspects necessary in terms of what is ahead to turn that project into a innovative business in the real world. In an interview with Michael Dearing, Reid Hoffman has framed the aspects of evaluation and asked "How do you think people should think about evaluating themselves as founders?" 

> "First you have to have an insight, a technical insight. Second you have to turn that insight into a product, and third you have to hopefully - God willing - turn that product into a business. Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you are energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that's a warning flag as well."

There is a natural force, especially for entrepreneurs that see themselves as specialists, a tendency into a execution where the entrepreneur hopes that reactive execution - to any focus goal as set - will solve structural problems, or it will pay for the any potential risks at the moment, and will anyway likely open the opportunity ahead anyway. This condition may be more or less evident, and strong - as in defining a role of a hero - depending on the actual person. Nevertheless, it becomes a reactive execution as it takes the entrepreneur in a way of execution that governs their own way of thinking, it envelops, embraces. 

In theory, this should be good, but it results in the entrepreneur. <!-- elaborate

In abstract terms, it becomes reactive to a goal of now and the risk naturally is mainly about the neglecting of the managerial effort that would put things in perspective.  

### Illustration case 

Imaginando um cenário normal - o empreendedor gasta tempo semeando, preparando p terreno, seu solo fértil. Ele então rega sua criação e logo engaja nas questões da colheita - cuidar de vender, cuidar do suporte, resolver as emergências. Ele observa que as ações estratégicas iniciais deram certo, sabe medir seu sucesso. Ao mesmo tempo observa alguns problemas ou seja planeja para que máquina operacional ou ações de colher os frutos sejam eficientes; assim suas ações agora precisam cuidar dos pequenos focos de incêndio como problemas de troca de mercadoria devido ao percentual de produtos estragados, problemas de inadimplencia (clientes não pagantes), problemas de comunicação com fornecedores, etc. Mas no modo governante, alerta e consciente, ele assume que essas ações são parte do processo - não reavalia, não tem tempo. A conclusão que ele chega é do tipo - vou aumentar as vendas, as vendas, e consequentemente o lucro trarão os resultados que eu preciso. Com mais lucro eu terei mais margem para cuidar desses problemas - posso colocar um estagiário ali, posso contratar um outro profissional para atender os chamados de suporte com cliente problemáticos.

Essa é uma ideia que diz - se eu ganhar mais eu posso usar essa grana extra para compensar. Essa forma de agir talvez seja mais natural do que imaginamos, talvez porque nossa tendência é separar o processo estratégico (semear) do tático (colher). Talvez ainda estamos ansiosos, na correria, e aí que mora o perigo para empreendedores, porque eles contabilizam perdas como parte do processo, passam a gerir as inconsistências e emergências como responsabilidade - ora, seria irresponsável não cuidar dos problemas da colheita. O problema? Esquecemos que certos incêndios e questões não precisariam existir em primeiro lugar, não mais acreditamos que podemos mudar a realidade, o empreendedor torna-se uma vítima de seu próprio sucesso inicial porque a mente governante, alerta e consciente, não abre espaço para lado criativo.

O empreendedor nunca aceita, por exemplo, reconsiderar se seus clientes são os clientes corretos. Uma vez a colheita feita, a realidade fica imutável.

Com isso ele acelera mais ainda essas ações, e oficializa que deve faturar mais, mesmo contabilizando emergências oficialmente. O negócio depende de uma gordurinha, um lucro que paga essas emergências. Daí com escala vem um problema, crítico. O empreendedor está se ocupando, grande parte do seu tempo com a gestão de apagar incêndios e esses problemas e esse tempo todo, ou parte dele, poderia ser tempo para uma libertação.

### When the ethical worker is also a high-performer 

When Marcio had insight and told Michael that the major problem was of a party, for what was nice, like flow. And not the denial to do the boring. So the doing the so good things led to use of energy in excess. Insigh of Marcio - "Thank you Michael. Your reply resonated so much with things in my head, concerns, sometimes not clear; it adds so much clarity. A few months ago, I had, virtually speaking, screamed — ah! It's that freaking party the problem. The party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course). The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow. "

Insight of Michael, not a public quote yet, that "Categorization --> clusters --> patterns --> priorities -- that's it exactly. Natural multi-taskers with a strong work ethic (that's what I hear in your opening above) can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them. That's a problem if you compound the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time. Thank you for the note. It's very helpful to see through your goggles." 

### The romantic 

An experienced and professional writer has written to me, in replying after what I have wrote to her, and she went direct to a point of pain: Marcio, do not make a dance or a song about something that is simple. She has asked me to go for the problem, to consider that the problem is simple. For the matter of working. I never thought that working was simple - which is an old idea I carry on, a sort of governing principle, a sort of operating model, influencing and always, how I engage with writing and other activities. 

Perhaps because of fears, perhaps because the idea of a judgement, related to the many aspects involved that I could be judged, such as grammar, typos, what I today think as of dislexia, a lot. All of these elements are like fireworks, not necessarily bringing the visual excitement but in the sense of a bombastic incident that always come my way, informing, signaling, of my fears, of my sense of protection, and even a projected sense of identity. 

In other words, I think, or feel, that I am not a person to write. Then, an almost rage comes my way, it would almost bring myself to be mad, but why would I do that? Actually, perhaps, it is a human trait to either go mad or go to other direction when the matter has to do with not engaging. 

I perhaps was the case that I had prior moments of frustrations, when older or elderly folks have called my attention about my mistakes. But over time, I didn't show those. Then, perhaps, I figured that I could move towards another space, another place, to be somebody in another setting. Thus, it appears that the human can specialize in their need to be somebody, to be effective or efficient, somewhere. 

( After note, when typing - I just remembered some of the ideas I have read from Adam Grant, from Originals, where he wrote that the brothers have a tendency to differentiate themselves. Such as the younger, that is generally taken as the one that is not going to be successful; he adds that yes he goes different, like a rebel, but he can also do really well when he goes for success. )

So we can come back to the case where the professional author advice seemed to touch a pain point in me - what was going on with Marcio - the act or attempt to make a song or engaging in a sort of dance. And even seeking joy.  

### Am I looking to put fun? Or is just about the being of somebody or really about finding stories or creative way to help ourselves? 

The detours to enhance a boring, or calm, work, with a set of animation seems to be quite possible. I wonder the actual origin of that idea, and also the complexities, how far one can do that. And also, it should be accounted, I wonder about the positive effects of the hyper investment in the detours or the whole tour. 

### The tour off duty 

The notion could be expanded as the tour off duty. When one entirely denies, and anchor himself in a new track. It might take to interesting places, undeniable. Of course, why not, right? Now, I am motivated, having fun, feeling energetic, no boundaries can come up with many sub tours as possible. 

Now, within the realm of the off tour, I am quite free, or arbitrary, mostly selecting what I want to do based on what captivates me. How far would that go and also how effective could that be for the actual goal? Like a planned wider, or long-term goal. Yes, some credible creations might happen, in the middle of all, but are these credible creations works that one could count on, involving progress? And the nature, regarding the nature of these works, when these projects become complex, would the protagonist be able to go through the ups and downs, like with perseverance? 

Or, again, would that be a pattern that repeats with the storied context, as the narrative of the project unfolds? It appears that the act of progressing for any project may actually be about writing upfront some goal, being able to select activities that pulls the goal closer, closes the gap, allowing room for precise work, for some aspiring work (check the balance) and be okay when the project ends with no perfect results achieved. Results, therefore, aren't the most important. 

### The responsible guardian 

<!-- 

## todo 

* p2 ( ) - In Part 1, Searching Impact, there is a whole section entitled "The guardian" which seems as a good introduction to the chapter "The feedback of urgency". Ref 9884-8944-9492-9044 #duplicated #crossreference 

--> 

Existe uma força que pode nos levar a preencher nossas agendas - que é resultante de uma crença que mais trabalho traz mais resultados. Essa força pede incremento, mais produção ou mais eficiência para as atividades em curso. Essa tendência no rumo da produtividade é de fato natural já que ações de empreendedores são guiadas também por feedback dos resultados. O problema é saber que tipo de feedback devemos ouvir; e reconhecer a necessidade de atuação nas várias frentes de um negócio. O foco unicamente ao design do produto, por exemplo, não resolve as questões relevantes para o crescimento e sustentabilidade do negócio.

Essa pressão torna-se positiva por conta que empreendedores fazem leituras a partir de sinais de tração, que podem se tornar aparentes de várias formas. Um empreendedor-programador, por exemplo, pode se sentir eficaz no processo de design e desenvolvimento do produto; e normalmente isso pode influenciar sua ações e o consequentemente o todo a partir da percepção que o caminho está correto. 

Em outro cenário, o empreendedor pode ficar 100% do tempo tratando de chamados de suporte ou incêndios relacionados aos seus atuais clientes; e isso pode criar um escudo para que ele possa visualizar outras necessidades estratégicas. A ideia é simples - se algo está funcionando, basta fazer mais do mesmo. Ou a expressão "em time que está ganhando não se mexe". Se a colheita continua vendendo então basta replantar do mesmo, seguir as mesmas regras.

Ainda, nem sempre o problema da execução reacionária é culpa da pressão externa, como um feedback positivo (uma leitura do mercado por exemplo). Mesmo quando o terreno é incerto, o empreendedor sofre dessa síndrome por execução e produtividade. É como se ele estivesse sempre pronto para escalar, para correr.

(A partir da elaboração do problema, ou síndrome, o empreendedor deve reconhecer a responsabilidade pelas outras dimensões do negócio. Alta produtividade é bom mas ter sucesso em certas áreas não garante progresso em outras dimensões.)

Essa síndrome coloca o negócio em risco devido as biases - pensamentos, padrões, hábitos, processos ou questões até culturais que acabam governando as ações do empreendedor. O professor James Green, no seu trabalho Opportunity Analysis Canvas (2015) alerta para uma característica conhecida como *representativeness* que é a tendência de comportamento empreendedor em confiar naquilo que ouve e vê no domínio próximo, como confiar nos seus conhecimentos anteriores, nos dados já conhecidos, nos seus próprios clientes, amigos, etc.

Nessa linha, é comum o empreendedor esbarrar em uma ou outra coisa certa, ou que parece certa, e criar sua própria narrativa que justifica não somente continuar avançando seu negócio da mesma forma mas até acelerar seu plano sem sequer duvidar do plano - isso quando existe um plano. Por outro lado, muitos simplesmente avançam com o fazejamento na esperança que a parte que dá certo irá compensar a parte que não funciona.

O problema e justamente o avançar das várias frentes de esforços sem muita consciência do que funciona e do que não funciona. Pior, eventualmente a coisa que funciona é contaminada pelo lado que não dá certo, seus produtos especiais se tornam medíocres, a soma de mais e mais cores no cardápio vira água de pincel.

Um exemplo de execução  simplista é a pizzaria que começa com 10 sabores e depois de alguns anos consistentemente ouvindo seus clientes ela tem 256 sabores e ainda deixa você criar sua própria pizza.

O problema talvez seja que empreendedores não reconhecem que até mesmo quando as coisas estão bem, eles têm que estarem continuamente no estado de aprendizado, de descoberta. Ainda, precisam ser mais rigorosos e não querer somar e somar, como aquele que coloca muitos pregos para segurar um quadro.

É provável que a maioria dos negócios hoje se encontra em um estado contínuo de descoberta e isso é um desafio que merece atenção justamente porque a tendência é a ação especialista, que normalmente envolve tentar escalar ou responder as demandas na tentativa de melhorar a situação com o ponto de vista de performance ou somar trabalho. Raramente o empreendedor dessa pizzaria aceita retirar itens do cardápio.

Assim empreendedores colocam mais produtos nas prateleiras, fazem mais campanhas, contratam mais funcionários, negociam melhor com seus fornecedores - enfim fazem mais atividades com a ideia de melhoria no sentido onde mais é mais. Mais promoções, mais servidos, mais produtos, mais clientes, etc.

Pior, quando suas ações mostram tração a consequência é inevitável. Passam a operar no modo reativo. Para o investidor Jason Calacanis (This Week in Startups, 2017, 3:04) o maior erro que fundadores cometem é que eles se tornam maníacos.. eles entram no modo reacionário respondendo e-mails, twits, e chamados abertos em seus próprios sistemas de gestão de projetos. Em outras palavras esses empreendedores acostumam  a apagar incêndios e não repensam as condições de risco que colocaram em primeiro lugar. Para Jason, eles não entendem que muitas vezes precisam parar o tempo e abrir espaço na mente para ideias, revelações e *insights*.

Essa execução reacionária basicamente diz para o empreendedor fazer mais do mesmo, ou mais daquilo que vem da mesma fonte. Então se eles criaram relações com clientes que não pagam em dia, torna-se normal continuar a respeitar esse ciclo vicioso e acelerar as ações que tentam remediar os atrasos, ao contrário de revisitar a história toda que seria prevenir.

## Transcending with compassion  

* Check Reid on https://youtu.be/ka--XKeI-o8?si=nPKD3gRtjmCEUNtm&t=3047

Reid Hoffman recognizes a style of management, and for that he refers to the work of Fred Kofmann [^footnote_conscious_business], of a compassionated view that transcends the individual needs and wants. The example he points uses the organization of an hospital to illustrate the point from the book of Fred, Conscious Business:  

[^footnote_conscious_business]: 

> "Take for example doctors working on patients. And you say, 'this doctor is not doing the job well'. Well, when you get them out of the building, you are actually being hugely compassionate to patients." (Hoffman, 2017, 50:14)

Although this principle of management is ease to visualize as operational in an organization, is becomes applicable to the startup in the sense that individuals are likely involved in a dynamic role, although one that - as we have discussed - might not be aware about other important things at other abstract levels. Thus any exercise that transcends the views of an individual bring bring up the possibility of a managerial role that is conscious for the larger organization - even if the larger organization does not entire exist.   

In other words, by embracing compassion for the organization in development, we bring in the notion that recognizes failure and adaptation as dependend on prior movement, more than to be formed by conclusions in retrospect. The driver that only learns after analysis in retrospect - logically better than no analysis at all - looses the humble viewpoint that can keep their consciousness for the business open. 

### Considerations the dynamic nature of objectives in the growth situation 

<!--

It might be necessary to do the course of Michael GM3 
https://www.harrisonmetal.com/classes/gm3-managing-engineers-and-artists

-->

The story of Harriet Tubman, as contextualized and learned by Michael Dearing, shows the effort of an individual that were able to scale herself, to adapt, into embracing new objectives and acessing a change into herself. Harriet became known as a hero fighting for human rights, actually recognized as one of the conductors of the underground railroad secret organization responsible for freeing slaves during the times of the American Civil War. But beyond that, Michael has brillantly pullet a complication in Harrie's life which can be used to life a condition and challenge in the life of entrepreneurs as their journey takes them into the possibility of embracing the higher-order objective, which they might even not initially fully visualize as they start. 

In a nutshel, she raised from freeing herself into becoming a leader in helping slaves to free themselves and beyond that, to work as entrepreneurs. According to Michael, she spent were in the role of freeing slaves for 15 to 20 years before she undertook a project to free 10x the amount of slaves that she has frred for the past years, a sum total of more than 800 slaves had escaped in steamboats and a plan initially thought by Harriet. (2018, 9:48)

The story of Harriet became for Michael a landscape to reflect about the challenges when one is in a mission that becomes larger, an objective that unfolds with larger key results. The model, entitled "Harriet's model for scaling," is provocation for founders, to a reflection, quite synchronized with the Reid's thinking of "What brought you here is not what takes you there." [^editornote_reid_stages]. 

[^editornote_reid_stages]: Check the quote from Reid, perhaps from the above interview video if not from the Blitzscaling one. 

The model starts with the recognition of strategic behaviors that while applicable at the small stage can prepare the situation for the larger goal (2018, 12:42):

* "Own your values, energy." 
* "Quick wins build trust. " 
* "Recruit allies -> networks. " 
* "Draft a playbook, iterate. " 

The identification of values shows a good startint point for founders. Exactly because in many endeavours that people get into, they might right there have not a clear picture of values. Thus, it becomes vital for any entrepreneur to use time in this regard. And it is not that founders's envisioned project don't have values - a lot of projects created with passion, and vision, actually connect with strong values. It is just that the energy to make the project real sometimes, can hide values that could also improve the founder's chances towards freeing themselves from constraints that can, in the lack of values analysis, lock them and even bring premature ends to what they do. The search for values is then a great exercise that opens the realm of possibilities beyond one or another current project, experiment or activity that is being undertaken. 

Another aspect goes straight to the discovery of the next stage. As one is experimenting with ideas, thus of course it should be recognized hands on projects, still the entrepreneur is also openning herself to the validating the system to be in place for the world ahead which of course synchronizes with values but should not be lock in a form or another. This very approach to what is being done opens a reflective model of management for the startup which seeks to validate or "to recruit" allies which are resources that signal, or funds, larger experiments and at the same time the evaluation of the larger goal. 

The identified component of the playbook becomes the exercise of value, as it has its built in mechanism for objectives evaluation. In the course of Harrison Metal, entitled General Management 2, Michael elaborates on principles for managing execution that takes in consideration that objectives can be both strong and weak. Strong in the sense of values, from the perspective of the objectives that gives motivation for movement, strong in the sense of the wider view that allows rooms for failure, for adaptation, for a conscious view for going from small and into growth. And weak, or better, humble, is the flexibility of evaluation that recognizes that the activities we pick, the key results we aim for, are at the same time closing a gap but also lifting ideas, understanding, evaluation, of the objective itself. Thus, one in a mission for a startup is automatically one in a mission for new management which requires a humble component that accepts that the objective,or the larger objective, is being discovered.
