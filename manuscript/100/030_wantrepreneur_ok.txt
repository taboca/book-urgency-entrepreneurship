In the world of entrepreneurship, there are many people passing on recipes about what is correct to do, the right way. And about what not to do, the wrong way. Moreover, there are categorizations that judge the entrepreneur's profile. One of them is the concept titled wantrepreneur.

Wantrepreneur, in English, is a pejorative term typically used to refer to someone who pretends to be an entrepreneur, who in some way seeks status, preferring to show results rather than work to achieve them. Therefore, this categorization is a warning given by some entrepreneurs, the real ones, when they want to help other entrepreneurs do it the right way. The alert serves as a warning and reminds that the entrepreneur's destiny is not status but the action of entrepreneurship, the results, and the impact. Nothing too wrong with that, right? When revising this section, I asked ChatGPT, what is wantrepreneur?

> *"Wantrepreneur is a pejorative term used to describe someone who talks about starting a business but never takes concrete steps to make it a reality. In other words, it's someone who 'wants' to be an entrepreneur but doesn't act as one. A wantrepreneur may spend a lot of time reading about business, watching lectures, or taking courses, but they never actually start their own venture. They may have many ideas but don't act on them or execute them. Often, these individuals may be more in love with the idea of being entrepreneurs than with the reality of working hard to build and manage a business. The term is often used to emphasize the importance of action and execution as opposed to mere contemplation or speculation in the entrepreneurial journey."* ChatGPT

Again, nothing wrong with that, there is a valid essence. From an optimistic side, it's an emblematic alert that creates pressure for the good of entrepreneurs. But let's face it, it's easy to be articulated by those who have made it after they have failed before achieving status of true entrepreneurs. It's these individuals, now real entrepreneurs, who can now tell the story of how to do it, now empowered to pass on their recipes, now feeling that they raise these warning signs. Don't be a wantrepreneur, don't write or communicate anything while in the aspirant stage, while under construction, be a true entrepreneur and deliver, act, execute first. 

The fact is that all these beings, you call them wantrepreneurs or entrepreneurs, once had to face the path of learning. The apparent problem is that the distinction doesn't deal with the process, for instance, of those who are beginners still trying to emerge. The real question is whether entrepreneurs start their journey with the goal of becoming entrepreneurs. Can they do that way? Where do things truly begin? In this context, in an interview by Roham Workman, Steve Blank was asked if entrepreneurship can be taught or if people are born with that. Steve openned his answer with his testament of how he and his friends were amuzed to see that he became a practictioner as they assumed that he was "the last guy on the planet that anybody would thought to be a strategist." The answer to the question, which took him about a decade to find, circled back to the question of "Who can entrepreneurship be taught to?" Or that entrepreneurship involves learning, indeed, involves practice, indeed, but also an initial movement, a volunteering intention:  

> *"About 500 years ago, we discovered in the Renaissance, you can actually train artists. First of all, you passionately have to want to be one. You want to be a sculptor or a painter or a musician. And the way you're going to learn is, yeah, we'll teach you some theory, but you're going to apprentice and do it tons of hands on. You're not going to learn how to be a painter by reading painting books."* (Blank, 2014, 10:42)

In the interview, he recognizes a entrepreneur is the one that passionately volunteers to be in, to engage with theory and a ton of practice, and that they develop the craft counting on support from the external environment like through a rich ecossystem like incubators, accelerators, and more.

Moreover, can they start entrepreneurship based on motivations, based on inspirations such as when inspired by successful entrepreneur models? Also, is wanting to be an entrepreneur a valid destination? Currently, yes, the entrepreneur can and should want to be, can and should desire to pursue dreams, can and should be inspired by examples. Indeed, they risk falling into the abyss and staying there at the bottom of the entrepreneurship ocean, somewhat conversing with model entities, learning, and experiencing the wonders of the romantic world of entrepreneurship. While exiting the abyss, rising to the surface, is important - as no one denies the fruit of entrepreneurship is changing the environment - still, the great complication of negatively labeling the wantrepreneur lies in the small chance of the protagonist going directly to a supposed successful execution, a supposed act of delivering results.

Who is anyone to systematize, or categorize, the path of entrepreneurs when they are discovering? But here in this reflection, we can think of some arguments that support the role of the entrepreneur who lives the entrepreneurship process. First, the recognition of their dreams and values. Second, the search for role models. Third pillar, the quest for learning. Logically, there are various other elements that support those who want to embark on entrepreneurship. The main point of the exercise is not to prescribe the right way but to zoom in on the process and recognize that discovery and permission are critical elements for the entrepreneurial journey.

### Dreams and values 

In the context of entrepreneurship, addressing dreams and principles with due importance is essential. The entrepreneurial journey isn't merely a series of actions aimed at profit-making. It's a mission deeply intertwined with dreams, principles, and a defined vision. However, a complication often arises when there's a tendency to minimize or "prune" the wantrepreneur aspect as one transitions into the role of an entrepreneur. This denial may be fueled by a mistaken belief that the realism of entrepreneurship doesn't allow for a high degree of inspiration, romanticism, or that grand visions can be a hindrance to immediate action focused on the market.

This mindset, however, is not only limiting but also counterproductive. The relevant question, therefore, is: how to effectively balance these forces? The answer lies in two fundamental steps. The first is the need to deeply reflect on the dreams and motivations that drive the desire to venture into entrepreneurship, and to identify guiding principles. This is an essential step to reconnect with the original vision and strengthen determination.

The second step, equally crucial, is to translate these dreams and principles into tangible actions that allow progress without sacrificing core values. In this exercise, we can find inspiration in Jim Collins's work "Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" (1994). Collins emphasizes that "Visionary companies make some of their best moves by experimentation, trial and error, opportunism, and—quite literally—accident. What looks in retrospect like brilliant foresight and preplanning was often the result of 'Let’s just try a lot of stuff and keep what works.'" This perspective encourages a balance between maintaining visionary ideals and engaging in practical, adaptable actions to navigate the unpredictable path of entrepreneurship.

Applying this concept to entrepreneurship, we can envision a dynamic where values and vision provide necessary guidance, while at the same time allowing freedom for experimentation and execution. In this way, the vision of the wantrepreneur and the efficacy of the entrepreneur not only coexist but complement each other, enabling a successful and principled entrepreneurial journey.

### Models 

Now, what role models should we seek for inspiration? Well, these models are always changing, and you should choose the ones that fit your business and objectives. But the matter of role models is simply a means for you to interpret valuable lessons, principles, and behavior models. This is because it's simpler this way and because the world of knowledge is documenting things in this manner — presenting people's ideas and creating models, or representations, for you to first engage and be inspired. So, looking to role models is a shortcut we can use to retrieve lessons, their thoughts, and behaviors.

Ray Dalio, a superb role model, has stated that he created a "deck of cards" of knowledge. Because he documented this knowledge in his book "Principles," you wouldn't need to try to contact him and convince him to help you. And this is precisely what Brian Chesky, another model and co-founder of Airbnb, pointed out — that if you achieve success, you could talk with great people who can teach you. But if you haven't achieved success, as was his situation once, the good news is that these role models are in books:

> *"And the cool thing is, the more successful you get, the more you have access to them. But even before you get really successful, you can certainly read about the best. And I also learned from biographies, but I think going to the source [is a good advice.]"* Brian Chesky (Greylock, 2015, 1:23:02) 

In other words, note that there is a connection between role models and the knowledge and behavior documented by them. But indeed, there are different types of role models. The good news is that you can test your models, read about what they say, understand their principles, explore the books they read, etc.

### Learning depends on listening.

Another important element in the initial or perpetual journey of the entrepreneur is the issue of learning how to learn. According to Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, Brian Chesky is an example of an infinite learner:

> "The term that I use for it is 'infinite learners,' and you're actually one of the people I use as an example. Because literally the very first time you and I did a press event, it was the first time that I had done a press event with an entrepreneur in my portfolio where the very first question you asked me when we got off the stage was 'What should I have done better?'" Reid Hoffman, (Greylock, 2015, 1:00:04) 

Connected with this idea of the infinite learner is a behavioral element, which is the capacity to listen and seek feedback. Paul Graham, an investor at YCombinator, in his essay titled "Before The Startup," confirms that the capacity to listen is one of the key elements for the success of founders.

> *"Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a predictor of success. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened."* (Graham, 2014)

## The essence of entrepreneurs

In summary, we can't say that the wantrepreneur role has to be redefined or that it is necessary. We shouldn't bother with specifics from ideas that aren't clear yet; and we can do better by turning our attention to the what matters, such as to consider the above and many other considerations that characterizes an entrepreneur in development. 

In essence, the true spirit of an entrepreneur aligns with Steve's viewpoint that they see themselves as entrepreneurs willing to learn while executing the craft. And for that, support is the key ingredient to be planted everyday, as everyone will make mistakes learning and reflection rises from that support which improves listening necessary before growth. 

On their path, there are crossroads and opportunities - to navigate towards the side of status or to navigate by seeking clarity through truths, principles, and values. The biggest risk of seeking status is that this pursuit can greatly hinder learning. Doers can also fall into being arbitrary doers. Arbitrary doers can become stuck too. On the other hand, the always-learning entrepreneur sees themselves as an aspirant first and foremost.

Through the development of an entrepreneur - and some of its characterizations could be identified by the ones tagging wantrepreneurs - the  may be working on a message, like the David Ogilvy brilliantly  "the best way to increase the sales of a product is to improve the product" (Ogilvy, 1983, our translation). So be it, if you are projecting yourself, exercising your aspiration, and navigating the space that could be called wantrepreneur, remember that this is your chance to improve yourself and not to give up.

Entrepreneurship, as discussed by Steve Blank and highlighted in the article "Who is an Entrepreneur," is less about inborn talent and more about a deep-seated willingness to learn and engage. Blank's comparison to Renaissance artists, who needed both passion and hands-on practice, underscores this idea. Whether one starts as a wantrepreneur or an entrepreneur, the key differentiator is the internal drive to embark on this challenging and unpredictable journey. This concept suggests that entrepreneurship is not just taught, but also chosen, with success stemming from a blend of desire, dedication, and hands-on experience.

## The essential entrepreneur 

An essential component of entrepeneurship - and a quite exciting one - is that all entrepreneurial action involves an initial movement that can be of the romantic kind. I like to think that it has to do with a kind of romantic art [^footnote_romantic_art_ayn_rand] where the doer feels empowered to change the world. Consider the story of Oliver Evans, the american inventor recognized as a protagonist in the history of the high pressure steam engine - the thing that later found traction in the world of locomotives. He couldn't be aroud, not enough time, to witness the movement of the heavy weight carrying locomotives, spreading around the United States and producing change by its steady speed and arrival the on-time. And from that, not witnessing what became necessary - the air brake system invented and produced [^footnote_wikipedia_georgewestinghouse_airbrakes] by George Westinghouse - and allowed those heavy trains to be stopped safely, and efficiently on time. On the good side, he didn't live through more complications in the nightmare of court battles around patents [^footnote_mauryklein_oliver_court]. It would be too much pressure for him to take I would think. Just too many revolutions going on already in Evan's world around the end of 1700s and early 1800s. 

[^footnote_romantic_art_ayn_rand]: Ayn Rand's perspective on romantic art emphasizes the division of artistic endeavors into "valid" and "invalid" forms. According to her philosophy, as discussed in Wikipedia, art forms like photography are considered "invalid" because they merely record the world as it is, with limited capacity to convey a moral message beyond the choice of subject matter. Rand believed that art should strive to elevate and idealize the human spirit, aligning with her broader philosophical system that celebrates individualism and heroic potential.

[^footnote_wikipedia_georgewestinghouse_airbrakes]: George Westinghouse was an American entrepreneur and engineer who invented the railway air brake system. This innovation greatly improved the safety and efficiency of railroads by using compressed air to operate the brakes of trains, allowing them to be stopped more reliably and quickly than before. His invention revolutionized the railroad industry and led to the founding of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company. For more detailed information, visit the Wikipedia page on the Westinghouse Air Brake Company: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Air_Brake_Company. 

But he saw a lot of it coming anyway. From humble origins and unable to be educated in private schools, in a time when public scholls didn't exist, the young Evans showed an interest to the mechanical things as he apprenticed with a wheelwright. That place might have given him the opportunity to be a quite resourceful, and hands on, kind of inventor and the opportunity to bring part of his visions to the world. Still, what he had planted, the seeds, were quite ahead of his time, as, according to Maury Klein, Evans suffered with the frustrations of being able to see creations that needed more from the technology and materials of his time. What is it that some of these dreamers and doers have that pulls them to move to a point that it seems absurd when he hear stories like the following: 

> *"When he was seventeen, a trivial incident drew his attention to what became a lifelong fascination. One of his brothers told him that for fun a friend, the son of a blacksmith, had 'stopped up the touch-hole of a gun-barrel, then put into it about a gill of water, and rammed down a tight wadding. When they put the breech-end of it into the smith's fire, it discharged itself with as loud a crack as if it had been loaded with gunpowder.'" (Klein, 2009, p. 33)

Whatever he had dreamed were the kind of goal that propelled his work. Yet it took him 17 years to get to make a bit of that to work, to be seen as useful and real in the world, such as the steam engines used to pump water, such as the automatic milling machine, such as to write up a guide to support promoting and educating the young millwright to operate and thrive with it. And with that his long term vision were alive too, developing and endured, as the following drawing [^footnote_oliver_oruktor] of the Oruktor  shows: 

![Evan's design for the Oruktor Amphibolos , 1834](images/100/Oliver_Evans_-_Automated_mill.jpg)

For me, the story of Oliver shows a bit of what it is an entrepreneur because he had embraced the challenges, such as to embrace the inventor following a vision, to access a new world; therefore to access the creative part. And, on the very same hand is about being a doer, around the world, going through the challenges and in a way to destroy existing preassumptions, or core components, of an old world and story that can be rewritten, such as the necessity for manual labor. Yes I am reducing - I can't go back to interview him - of course. 

But I bet that he cared for other benefits from the realization of that automation, such as the benefits that could give him the means to create more impactful things, the benefits to get more support to the course of opportunities. In other words, he were interested in sustaining the thing that he saw as the new vision, to secure investment support, to secure the good conditions for that kind of entrepreneurial action to continue to thrive. It is then undeniable that money coming from the sales of those creations would serve a good purpose. 

What I like about the story of Oliver is that although it has the romantic and creative twist, it is a story of a doer that keeps messing up with the environment, call it the market or life. In other words, it boils down into the Schumpeterian point about the role of entrepreneurs: 

> *"We have seen that the function of entrepreneurs is to reform or revolutionize the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or, more generally, an untried technological possibility for producing a new commodity or producing an old one in a new way, by opening up a new source of supply of materials or a new outlet for products, by reorganizing an industry and so on." (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

> *"To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct economic function, first, because they lie outside routine tasks which everybody understands, and secondly, because the environment resists in many ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions with the enterprise exploit. It consists in getting things done." (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

--> 

Now has Schumpeter misunderstood the entrepreneur reducing it as the pure doer? No, I would think, exactly because of a premisse that the incessant doing of the doer brings up freedom from the current stream and the way things are done. It other words, doing leads to reinvention just like writing every day leads to clear writing. But the very twist to the incessant doer lies in the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction, where the macro phenomenon is a projection of the same individual mechanism in the individual that does - when they see it and when they feel empowered to act on it - which involves challenging their own status quo and bring about change to themselves in the first place.
