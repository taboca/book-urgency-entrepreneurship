## The Fine Line: Balancing Execution and Judgment in Entrepreneurial activities

* First draft 

I wanted to write, the theme, about the emotions and judgements that can get into the way of the execution of projects. Start-ups, teams, and their constituents are people - they feel, they have emotions. We are also storytellers, and we make sense of what we do with narratives. And, we judge what we do, when we do it in realtime. It`s our natural ability. 

But the focus for this essay is about the life of an entrepreneur that wants to execute projects that demands progression. That is the situation for many. In that context, within this situation, this realm, the situation also has to do with one that seeks to innovate as one wants to break in a market, to call attention of potential users, buyers, stakeholders, partners, and more. 

Therefore, the entrepreneurial goal necessarily involves outcomes to that start-up, team, and one - the constituents -are interested in achieving. In other words, there is discovery. So it comes down to the art and science of progressing onto something that is not guaranteed. 

The complication, in the ocean of many complications, has ties with on one end, the excitement, the vision. Another angle, the expectations, associated with goals (or the outcome after goals). And, on the other hand, the realities in thw world of doing it. The execution with the results in the present will cause reactions from the individuals, which ar part of the teams. Tension comes in play, from the judgement, and analysis and trying to probe the ideas, the methods, the solutions, the market interest, and ones to help. And the jugment comes as narratives. As we have to tell ourselves how we are doing, tell others. We advance by telling. 

Consider the science and art of pitching, for example. When many say that knowing how to pitch matters, and many say, yes it matters. Marc Andreessen,

I think the formal presentation is another test . . . As a founder, if you are not good enough at your job as a CEO, to get up and present, to institutional investors, for 60 minutes, and sell them on your thing . . .

We love when somebody walks in and has a compelling pitch so we can give them a check . . . that is a successful day for us.

In contrast, every other pitch you ever gonna make is going to somebody that is going to be much worse than us … Customers, they are going to be like — no, I am not going to give you any money — like their default position right? Engineers — you going to try to recruit engineers, and they got 20 other job offers, so why does your pitch is going to be much better than the other 20 startups?

The point here is that we are being judged by say "another point of view". In other words, judging ourselves all the time - all that we will do. When we craft a pitch, even before it is not shown to other, we do not even show and we read it as if we are a judge, an investors. Poor judgement right? It does not even have anything to do with the real outside world that, in the end of the day, it is going to read, to judge. 

Thus, it is up to us to keep track with methods that can support us to advance, to judge and judge it right, and judge in the right time. One theme in this theme is when to judge for execution of projects. Since a startup acts supposedly faster, things that really complicated as we are moving with specific tasks, when we are acting doing it. 

The focus here I am looking at is activities that be broken, generate poor results, as we judge in realtime. Knowing when to judge is a reflection that I invite you to engage here. And in this regard, we can get help from one of the area that is one of the most complicated fields that involves creativity and execution - an area that when judgement comes into the act of doing, writing. Two ideas, that explores the same point where our conscious judge gets in our way. The goal of these lessons is to spark in us a light, the light of control. 

"Aiming for that, I learned to write setting judgment aside and save a polish for later. I canned this new, freer writing "laying track." For the first time I gave myself emotional permission to do rough drafts and for those rough drafts to be, well, rough. " - (Cameron, 1998, p. 19)

Now, another point of view for writing, from the Art of Non-fiction, is from Ayn Rand, the philosopher known for objectivism. She pointed that when writing, the act of engaging with editing when doing the first draft is a writing approach that leads to major complications, such as the conscious editor process that messes up with the subconscious that needs to write, to run smooth. 

Looking at the writing moment of a writer, and stages, seems to give us a view of how we manage our activities, micro management where a judge comes into our way before. Both, Julia and Ayn Rand, recommend using the judgement, of course. But the real point is when to call it. 

Julia Cameron added that for the situations that she was able to put her judge aside - "When I went back to polish, I found there wasn't that much to fix or change. A remarkable amount of my first-draft material withstood the test of later scrutinity. " (Cameron, 1998, p. 19)

Therefore, it comes the point for us to reflect, to consider, that we will need to separate progressing from judgement to avoid the drama in the point of view of Julia Cameron. Judgement in the way is never a good judgement and can be, indeed, a drama.
