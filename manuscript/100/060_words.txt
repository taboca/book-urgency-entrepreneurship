In this reflection I want to make a call to action. I want us to reflect about how we, as founders or protagonists of our lives, are navigating the world - executing and learning - by navigating words. And as the world is now different, with a lot of words in front of us, how our navigation cam be influenced by words in front of us, words of the channels of communication we subscribe too. This reflection is a bit different from the other articles in the book, perhaps has more colors in it. It's a sort of letter I wrote to myself, and to us, and to founders, when I was having coffee, when I wrote it. As the letter is different, I wanted to give you an introduction to it. I have asked ChatGPT what it understood of the letter. 

## In ChatGPT terms 

The [following] article appears to discuss the power and influence of words in our lives, particularly in the modern age of technology and digital communication. The author reflects on how words shape our thoughts, actions, and decision-making processes. They use the metaphor of a "clastle of words" to convey the idea that we are surrounded and immersed in words, and our lives are navigated and influenced by them.

The author explores how words can be both empowering and manipulative. They mention touchy words that can motivate and encourage us, but they also point out that words can be used to manipulate us into making certain decisions or subscribing to certain ideas. They mention a personal experience at a bar where words influenced their decision-making process when ordering beers.

The article discusses the impact of the internet and social networks, where words are used to promote ideas and persuade users to take specific actions, often through Call to Action (CTA) buttons. The author questions the democratic nature of information access in the digital age and reflects on the power dynamics at play with the words that appear in front of us.

Throughout the article, the author also emphasizes the importance of reflection and critical thinking about the words we encounter and the impact they have on us. They reflect on how certain words and expressions can provide comfort and support in times of failure or struggle, similar to how a grandmother's comforting words might make us feel safe and encouraged.

Overall, the article seems to be a contemplative exploration of the role of words in shaping our lives, our choices, and our interactions with the world in the context of modern technology and communication.

## The words are stones

My friend. Although you, and we and us, may sometimes ignore that we live in a clastle of words, we do live in a clastle of words. We are navigating, escalating, on words. But them words don't seem like bricks that you can pick from a pile of bricks and do things. I wished they were as simple as that. That we could grab words and set them in ways where we could be ourselves, to set them in the place we wanted them to be. In fact, we are more likely stepping over words, not like when a stone is in on our way but stepping over them. We find them words in who spoke first, who said faster, and who wrote nicier. And there are many good words given by good people, such as who gave to us the right to use words, or the right to discern which words we can listen - they did a good job. We sort of came to where we are - into this aggregated set of good and bad words that leads to good or bad places - coming out from great revolutions. I am not here to blame the past that brought us here. 

But some of our own words, or constructions of the modern age and fruits of prior revolutions, has led us to the days of machines that can spill out words, of systems that boost the words in front of us. And all the sort of arrangements or things, services, products, experiences - things that came from words in the first place. 

The trick part is that there are touchy words, such as those that used to be used by a grandmother to encourage her sons, that can motivate us to learn, to trust, to be motivated, to advance. These powerful words are also being used to spark our motivation towards things of a new nature, such as when we subscribe to digital and non-digital experiences from new worlds. It's in everywhere. Like the matrix wallpaper. 

I have seen once when joined a bar with a friend and we were there to get a beer. The waiter brought the menu, a printed menu, before the days of the modern QR code menus [^qrquotemenudays] that took over in larger cities in Brazil after COVID days. Our menu had a promotion of a beer where you could buy 6 of them, in a basket, instead of going one by one. Well, we where there to relax, to have a beer. What did we do? 

[^qrquotemenudays]: The QR code menu days refer to the contemporary practice in Brazil where many restaurants and pubs have replaced traditional paper menus with QR codes, requiring customers to access menus via their smartphones. 

Somehow and counterintuively, we did the math, which brought us to tell the waiter that the combined set, in a basket, were more expensive than buying each one (and making him come back to us many times). He seem to have acknowledged and we just ordered the cheaper one. I was under the impression that such story would go away from my mind and heart now decades after. Now, in retrospect, I sort of regret why we didn't order the more expensive set after giving a lecture to the waiter about the complex math. Just for the sake of continuing the confusion. 

Anyway, it's in everywhere, these words. But perhaps these kinds of words are not visible for the enlighted minds - in the places where information such as good knowledge and conscious thinking - that could grasp a bit of the world before the flush of words has arrived. Perhaps the logic with words works a bit like that: We sort of suffer to understand words, and their creative constructions, that can sometimes gives us prizes. But then, we move into the world, and we find an abundance of them. And they touch us, they sort of carry on things that seem to be prizes. We see the beautiful train coming - we can't see the cargo. And now we don't have time to check the cargo, not at all times. You perhaps have to pick what you want with your instincts. We trust the skin of the train. 

It comes with a swirling whistle of those good old locomotives. And it is visceral. Quite applicable to tease the one that came from a long day of work, such as a Brazilian, that has reached a bar in the end of the day, the long day of work, that long day of work. Then he or she or they sit there. Give us a beer. Do you want the combo promotion it comes with 6 in the basket - the promotion. Yes, why not. The beer comes, and we numble. And that is it. As our goal where a good start for the next day. You won't notice if you paid more or less. And if one brings even the subject of checking those things, they are too much, out of the place and perhaps disturbing the moment, and the goal of having a happy hour - strong words. And it might make a bit of sense all that, doesn't it? The train comes, the sound comes, it trigger us. We not only buy the things that the train brought. We also get in the very same train, of words, more words, perhaps slinging the words, til the next station. 

The new system of words is everywhere, and pushing our impulses, to be connected and to connect. It is now in the physical and in the digital or in the blended space. And it indeed offers you the full access to everything. You can chose to read what they want, or you can pick the colors that they want, or to subscribe to the theme that they want. Your ability to chose is key, although a lot of you is provided by them, everywhere. If you doubt that the new world of information access is democratic, just ask the smarter people as we know it - the ones that are in good position, executors of major known companies such as Google. I have lived in there, although didn't pass in the Google interviews, but was there in the valley of the days. The valley of the days was the browser days that brought to us the means to navigate the internet. And it was blooming. We knew it, that the browser, and the act of browsing, was a tool enabling anyone to access anything. That part, only that, pays for everything; it covers the cost of the bad things that could be existing in the web and we didn't have time to read. Max Fisher, in the Chaos Machine points a saying from Eric Schmidt that "the answer to bad speech is more speech. More communication, more voices.” (Fisher 2022, p.38). Indeed, no one doubts that Mr. Schimdt is right. He is right. The medium accepts more voices. In other words, no one from Youtube will remove a good video even if it does not have any views. Although perhaps a video with no views can be stored in a less expensive storage system. 

In other words the company is saying that they brought the train which can bring the good cargo, such as shipments of books. And since it is democratic, it may like bring a shipment of shit. Thus, of course, it is not the trains fault. The carrier is just the carrier. If we shoot the train, as many sometimes try when they are mad with words, it won't really work. That because there is no math to stop the train. That because the train is immune to the attacks. It's more like a tool. And now the people is using it. They depend on it. The complication could be - in old west terms - like saying that horses are not good because the first horses appeared with robbers on it. Even the one that considers to attack the whole, are likely to get rid of the robbers and keep the horses to give a good use for them. But the internet, and social networks, are only great carriers for most of us. And if one is not attacking but serious about judging these systems, as they enter into analysis, they are likely to find amazing things. For the one that studies the roots of the web is the one that understands that the web is like water coming from a water mine in the mountain. And even knowing that people make shit beverages with water; still, it's water. It gives them access to good thoughts. There is value everywhere, available, but under the sea. Eric Schmidt might have entered that space of value before he had the chance to learn how to use words by navigating the ocean of garbage. 

But then, for us entrepreneurs, founders, we might think that it does not apply to us. That we could be sort of like Eric, in a way, more enlightened, and able to step over the right words as we navigate the medium. Are we able to navigate? Perhaps there are the ones that are immune to visceral things, to when the words are in front of them, shining, promoting ideas, suggesting a direction. Perhaps there are the ones that can stop subscribing to the too many channels of experiences from the new world. The ones that can searchg for what they want, as in to be in control. But then the things that they search, the things that they read, can still be constructions of a sort of arbitrary life, perhaps arbitrarily driven by their networks. 

But now, we in front of new systems of words, we don't have a grandmother next to us to take care or us. Or a mentor. We are on our own. But as well enchanted with words that pushes us over, to somewhere. But now, the new world of words are not words arranged in text such as in a way that gives us that longer experience of reading leading to reflection, where we could feel the visualizations and grasps what is inside us as we progress with them words, such as when you follow them through the pages of a book, as it used to be the case. Or what we see now is different from the act of writing, a hand letter, which naturally pulls from us a value that has less to do with the speed, or lack of speed, and nothing to do with the effort of moving our hand. There is something about using the hands to write, something about letting your body move with the words that come out of us, in a medium that allows us to achieve more clarity. It could be the same when typing too, of course, perhaps. As long as you are there for long enough, in front of that page that asks you to write, when your body feels that the page asks you to write. But no, this new world of words compels, it invites, and it is visceral. It is also a transactional world. They are asking us to push some button. 

Not many people can differentiate a advertising that shows in the first page of results of a search engine such as Google. And for the ones that can, and don't want to follow that ad, still not many of them can differentiate if the resulting page is not a carrier to another ad or an ad in itself. But all of us anyway see the button that asks to engage. There are even words now to describe the act of using words to ask for the next stage of interaction - it is known as CTA or call to action, the next step of a transactional world. When in doubt, we can ask help, from our network. But do we have the time? And are they able to have the time to see more than us?

All of the above, my own words arranged like that, want us to be in a place, a place of reflection that there is a power dynamics going on with words that appear in front of us. These are the words that carry an appeal in a given context that we might just go for it, consume them, accept them. Our deal with words can be like when we start to like a train because we have trusted that train such as the fact that it is on time. We are okay to live our lives by stepping into words that make us see and feel the logic. The train is on time matters a lot. The clock that ticks matters a lot. It allow us to run the cycle of a day, a day that we might be doing somewhere else the acts of survival. This trusting, with the train of words, comes out when we follow sentences that are grammatically correct, it is half way there. If we feel that there is logic, it is half way there. As we feel as we read, if we see colors, then it only gets better. Therefore it does not have to be that visceral for the many of us to fall in the world of words. Again, we are navigating, stepping over stones, sort of crossing a river to reach the other side. We sort of know the words that can take us to the other side. It works, we got to the other side. 

Then we do it again. Same river, same stones. We eventually fall, and get the point. Oh, tricky words, tricky stone, that brought me down. Oh, half of these stones were placed there in the first place. Oh, is this river real? When we do, we reflect, it comes a moment that calls for a refactoring about our way of navigation. Or it sort of almost invite us into that reflective state. But we don't really find words for that, not at that moment, in that context. Right there, before the chances to learn about what we we doing, it comes a good human instinct that tell us that we are good climbers. Yes, we love to come back to it. 

The workplace version of that comes when we face a point of failure that almost tells us that a lot of what we did was pointless. At that point, when we see that we are still around, we suddenly find comfort words, also from the ones around us. They bring into the scene other kinds of words such as "you did such an effort," indicating that it was ethical, that we have learned a lot. Words that support us, good words you know, that indicates that the struggle was an important part too. There is nothing wrong with these arrangements of words, of course. And it is even joyful as that seem to indicate that real life exists in the scene of that weird river, isn't? At those moments, when all seem to fall apart after the long run, and we find the moment of reflection and supportive buddies next to us, we fell safe. As in the grandmother is there. Oh, so there is humanity here in this company. And that enlightened moment, that saves you as you were almost dead from sacrificing yourself over stones that weren't real, it brings you back. That new moment starts like light. It seems to come, again, like a train. Wake up, you can do it, we are heroes. Let's get back on track, quick. Then life becomes mechanical again. Then uou are back and we can't even realize we became the train that moves the cargo, to somewhere, on time, in the track. When you are about to get back on track, try to visualize what a grandmother would tell you.
