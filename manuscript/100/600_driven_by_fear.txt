# Fear drive

Fears move mountains. Not as direct, as in fear drives faith. In this chapter, we will consider the role of fear, especially in the fast-paced world, and how it affects our decisions. If we set our time machine to somewhere 30000 to 36000 years ago, and find a human on a tree fearing the fearless wolf that paciently waits, we can visualize - and respect - that feeling which improves the chances for survival in the face of the danger. Someone in your ancestors tree feared some treat so that you are reading this book and able to feel the situation of when fear is iminent. But back to the future of now, the metaphor that fears move mountains makes sense as decisions in the knowledge economy, especially in the digital landscape, are driven by thoughts and perceptions. Now the mountain can be the pile of resources such as money or time, theh wolves could be our competitors, and the organization the tree where we can go up and down and hopefully survive so to be able to able to paint the situation in a stone wall around the corner.

And if some of this sounds far from where we live, I fear that we must confront, or celebrate, or simply accept the fact that narratives driven by fear are so naturally administered into the veins of our corporate body that we don't even make a sense of how our now-networked brain responds. And all of this becomes serious given that the startup situation deals with threats as projections, more than real threats. As in, growth is ahead, or risk or prizes are ahead; thus there is the implied element of risk analysis and the potential that larger sums of resources are to be deployed so that growth happens. In other words, a lot is based on signals, or perceptions, therefore less related to real threats or iminent risk. 

But the complication, and the reason for us to be together, is that the entrepreneurial agenda does not allow room to discuss our fears, or the role of fear, or how fear drives productivity, such as how fear eloquently shapes narratives that affects our decisions. To note, or to narrow our scope and increase the complexity of the situation, the setting of a startup starts with a few people, (founders, team, family) which means more authorithy, more agility. In other words, although the mountain of resources is small, it is big enough to impact the future. 

With that, and depending on the circunstances of what is ahead, we know that people can be more or less fearful. And, although we don't generally characterize teams, or divisions, as fearful, we will explore how the constituents turn fears into narratives that are powerful to change directions. Unfortunately, the matter of fear is not generally addressed, or properly, in work situation. If a team member had the courage to put straightforward such as "I am afraid of going in this direction" it would perhaps be a call for a discussion. But reality is that fear chimes differently, like the motion in the backstage, such as when an authority says "I fear that we will be killed by our competition if we keep ignoring them." Therefore, in this chapter, let's respect fear as an element that pushes the entrepreneur's journey, the pace and the path of innovation. 

Let's start with visualizing fear in the work situation first, how we experience it in ongoing conversation of the day - at the interpersonal level. Then we will explore how the individual is highly influenced by fears of threats - of course, not directly to their lives - but to their identities or a value that is key for their ongoing narrative. We will also consider different point of views and other reflections where fear is recognized as present from the individual level to the management situation of large organizations. As we move on, not to supress fear but to note and acknoledge, we shall identify more vividly how fear enters the communication of teams, and impacts decisions in the everyday, as it causes blockage, defense, censorship, or attack. 

### When the stakes are high - how we experience in the corporate 

This [project] will blow up! Is what I once heard from my manager, after he had invited me into a weekly meeting. I think that he feared a dead end if we didn't act in a different way. Perhaps, as we were not doing enough, that we could put more effort or do things in a different way. What is interesting - now in retrospect - is that it didn't cross my mind to offer a support to him, to elaborate on his fears. Perhaps that inaction was just part of the mood and context that we were in at the time. The mood that gave the title of "war room" to the place where most of us had to work - a sacred space for getting things done. It was unavoidable to see a future where we would not exist, our team, and consequently myself, as worker of a well known and respected Silicon Valley company, and the rent, and myself as an immigrant in US. 

A few years later, back in another office of another Silicon Valley company, I caught a post-it glued to the keys of my laptop. It was written that "Things are not working yet!" I have picked the post-it and brought it to the vice president, which happen to be who hired me. To which he replied that "this is unacceptable in America." I won't ever forget his reaction, how he was protecting, as in within 9 seconds. 24-hours later he told me that he was not anymore working for that company. I don't know if any of that were connected, I don't even know exactly what had happened. Anyway, in retrospect, I think that he feared that the company lacked a more transparent or ethical communication, or perhaps he feared that the note would decrease my chances to thrive in that organization, thus to help the organization. 

With these examples, I am not searching that management is driven by the dramatic moves driven by fears. But it is undeniable that fear chimes in a range of levels such as a more softly perceived fear to up to what others refer as raw fear. At this stage of reflection, my intent is to position us in the place of respecting that fear in the corporate setting might be present as a beast behind the actual scene. In other words, constituents are able to feel threats from a potentially risky situation which pulls them to come up with a narrative, which can become quite colorful, quite real, and meaningful. In other words, the feeling of a painful outcome triggers the creative mind to come up with a story, a narrative or a calling which may prompt us to take a key action. 

### Fear and the storied context 

Some individuals, through projects in the corporate setting, are likely expressing an identity which is not necessarity a reflection of their true self, of the present. The expression that they find comes as they seek to perform, as they see themselves as conductors for certain causes - it could be a key result ahead of a major objective. This expression might come in various ways as they see themselves as leaders for a cause, as advocates of a cause, a salesperson, you name it. 

From a storytelling perspective, the doer becomes a protagonist, or a conduit, or a messenger. Although what they do involves a set of specialized actions and behaviors, like when one is in control of how they act, the performer displays and develop behaviors, at the same time expressing their and shaping their identities.  

As we frame from a storytelling perspective, it helps us to understand that emotions, such as feelings of loss, are experienced quite strong in situations such as in the entrepreneurial setting. The book Storynomics (2018), whose audience is mainly for marketers interested in improving their communications, shows how people's perception about things can highly influence what they decide. The authors refer to a selection of scientific works that shows that people's perceptions about pain (or pleasure) are felt based on what is presented to them, as in narrated, how they imagine the given narrative. The selection of studies presented (2018, p.43) does a service, by supporting scientific evidence, for what the world of advertising has cracked and profited, for a while [^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics], althought generally understood as a subject of persuasion.

[^editornote_robertmckee_storynomics]: 

Now the fact that the advertising of the west has discovered - by measuring results with customers - reveals that people decide based on narratives and stories that they are told and listen. In other words, it matters a lot - minimally for advertising agencies as we can confirm - that in the end of the day people bring to their lives, that they decide, based on what they listen, no matter if the the stories told are seen as persuasive forms of communication, or emotional communication, rhetoric, and on on. Or, from another perspective, the advertising of the west didn't discover but nevertheless understood the natural mechanism of how people decide from the perspectives from the narratives that they are told. In part three, we will explore further the subject of human communication as narration [^footnote_prelude_human_narration] but for now we will maintain the equilibrium by focusing on how fear drives us. 

[^footnote_prelude_human_narration]: The work of Walter Fisher, Human Communication as Narration, will support us to improve our awareness of how people reason and decise based on the the experiences that they tell and listen. 

But if what is told makes people fear is only does so effectively in the face of an ongoing conversaion, an ongoing train that is moving. We recognize this train of thought if we imagine a team of people in a locomotive where the destination is a city but out of the sudden the train stops right before a bridge. In this situation, if someone says that they might have stopped to appreciate the view, some people might laugh or be mad with the realization of the irony or how the observation does not fit the reality of what is happening. Thus the storied context makes the possibility for what is told to be coherent or not, to be truthful or not. 

Thus in the tracks of our work projects, such as an entrepreneurial effort, What happens is that things go awry, or appears to be going in the bad direction, exactly as we want things to go in a certain direction, such as to stop by a key result associated with a higher-order objective or destination. All sort of situations that trigger fears such as the consideration that projects are going to be abruptly terminated, such as that layoffs as necessary, or if an entire division needs to be closed. And how certain things are triggered to our lives appears in different ways, because one may feel compassion for the people who could be affected, or when a leader feels in a position of being a messenger for a cause, a train conductor, you name it. Just as a train conductor is happy when the train is running smoothly and feels bad when it's no longer operational, the context of entrepreneurship and businesses also means a track of possibilities where the performers are protagonists who cares more than just be participants in a train going to any arbitrary place. 

Thus the work situation, and especially the entrepreneurial situation, creates a stotied context where certain values are established and helps to create an equilibrium. These values can be acessed if we dig into reflecting beyond actionable ideas like "we need to keep working in this project tonight" which might be associated with expectations of significant milestones, such as expected state of happiness of the team, expected state of security to the team or the project, or any measure of success that is ahead. Thus it's natural for a person's identity to be linked as a responsible being, emotionally and ethically connected to a duty as the failure to do so might trigger an actual real impact to their lives, like the unsolvency of their ability to work, which triggers other fears as, for example, people may need to work for money or other reason they hold as value. Suddenly, due to various factors, external or internal, experienced or perceived, the protagonists find themselves crafting narratives that are powerful in the face of the experience of fears and emotions they projected. 

### The works in the head - the experience in the head 

Perhaps this association is common in the world of artists or those involved in creative works. But it serves us well to reflect that a lot of what people do start in their heads, in a black box.

Thus, relevant in the entrepreneur's context is the censorship that becomes decisive, even though we don't acknowledge fears. But our fears from situations like dreaming, reflecting, or planning, can quickly engage a self-censor. In other words, our fears might act behind the scenes although it impacts a world of possibilities, which might limit what we do. Dealing with these subject it not a simple task, such as of asking technical help or even reading book, because it involves taking initiative and to engage in reflective thinking, to put things in perspective, such as what comes from reflective writing or other related processes that involves asking for help, just like one would when one enters a session with a psychoterapeut, or a coach, or board members.  

Author Julia Cameron, known for her book The Artist's Way (1992), assists artists from various fields in navigating their creative potentials and blocks. Her 12-week course, which is outlined in the book, includes what is an apparently a simpple exercise of "morning pages," consisting of writing long hand-written pages every morning; an essentially liberating practice that exercises the mind, much like a gym for the body, allowing the censoring side of the mind to cease stifling creativity. It's a technique that encourages making mistakes, experiencing fears, beginning with granting oneself permission.

Through Julia's explanations, we can see how she discovered this technique throughout her career. She was a recognized artist in Hollywood who, at some point, had her work rejected (please verify this information around page 40 in the book). In her account of the emotions she experienced, she likened the feeling of her work's rejection to the loss of a pregnancy.

### Practicing detachment and procrastination 

In this section we shall consider how fears can trigger us into doing something else, and the important of mitigating fears and being transparent about them in the first place. 

Para resolver isso, o primeiro passo é reconhecer, observar. Também vale o exercício de refletir em momentos protegidos, não debaixo de pressão, como por exemplo usar a técnica apontada no capítulo "correntes alternadas" para permitir paralelizar exercícios que lhe ajudam a mitigar os medos e mapea-los de fato. Neste sentido vale o exercício apontado por Tim Ferriss, em Trabalhe 4 horas por semana, ... [Colocar o exercício do Tim Ferriss aqui]

Escrever o que pode acontecer de fato é uma forma de planejamento. Uma vez mapeado, aquilo que era medo de algo que não se sabe, torna-se um mapa mais estratégico. Nessa atividade você acaba colocando os passos intermediários que são necessários para resolver o problema.

Agora, tratamos de medo que cria bloqueio ou censura, uma vez que exercitamos nossa capacidade de sermos criativos vamos nos acostumando a ideia de escrever, rascunhar, conversar, planejar; essa atividade que nos permite sair da zona da paralisia e partir para a ação. Com isso faz sentido aquele pensamento que diz que o corajoso é o medroso que deu o passo; ou que o louco é o corajoso que não tem medo.

### Reflection on fears working for principles 

We want to feel emotions, we want to recognize fear, we want to allow ourselves to be vulnerable. With these exercises, you can embrace fear so that you can explore possibility, mapping rissks and possible actions. The entrepreneur that embraces their fear, which allow the conflict and asks for help, is one that engages into the collaboration process; which is a big idea in the sense that it has to do with allowance for a wider view, a different perspective, which opens the door for an actual wiser view about the entreprneurship, as opposed to the constraints of the identity of the role that promotes the journey, such as the particular reality of a founder. The allowance for disucssions of fears, the conscious discussions about how fears are translated into the narratives, means a seed for the culture that is a truth seeking culture. 

Doug Leone, partner of Sequoia Capital, explains how he keeps himself motivated and seeking for more which is challenging as he is part of one of the most sucessful venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, which would naturally put him into a situation of a comfort zone. 

> "When you are successful a little bit, the greatest danger you have is the fact you were successful. " Doug Leone (Brazil at Silicon Valley, 2019, 7:02)

He added that ""**raw fear**", is what motivates him; as he recalled the days when he would walk at the Stanford Shopping center, in 1988, making about 67000 dólares per year, knowing that he didn't have enough money to buy gifts. (Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2014, 45:22). And went on to recognizing the fears that kept him to work, such as fear of being lay-off from Sequoia, fear of messing up with the life of entrepreneurs. Thus, for Doug, fear is a motivation force. 

### Reflection on fears from the factory 

Andy Grove também compartilhou uma ideia parecida, de medo como força que motiva a criatividade e também a ação - medo de perder em relação ao competidor, medo do produto não ser bom para clientes, etc. Para Andy Groove, (????) existe uma sequência de emoções que são similares às emoções da perda de pessoas queridas, que podem ser vividas por pessoas questão no meio de situações que ele chamou de pontos de inflexão. [Colocar o exemplo de Andy, sequência da perda da pessoa querida, seguido da sequência no domínio da empresa que vive o ponto de inflexão. ]

O próprio Andy revela que ele escreveu um dos seus livros no meio de uma dessas jornadas turbulentas que a Intel passou em torno de 198x [conferir em Let Chaos Reign] - sugerindo que naquela situação ele poderia estar escapando de reconhecer a situação.

O que tiramos disso, é, mais uma vez uma ideia simples mas que não podemos ignorar - somos humanos, nos sentimos e vamos nos envolver e vamos provavelmente coordenar nossas ações de empreendedorismo em função das emoções. Mas isso não significa que não podemos tirar tempo para reconhecer e refletir sobre isso tudo. Se o ex-CEO  da Intel reconhece que estava escapando do problema maior ao escrever um livro será que nós também as vezes engajados em certas ações responsáveis como forma de bloquear ou como autodefesa para não corrermos o risco de sentir perda ou sentir emoções fortes como medo e insegurança?

Andy Grove ainda articulou uma versão corporativa do potencial da perda, a auto defesa - uma situação onde empresas que estão passando pelo dito ponto de inflexão, decidem compras outras empresas. Ela perguntou, em Only the Paranoid Survive, por que será que empresas de eletrônicos do Japão, que viveram mudanças grandes em seus mercados e indústria, compraram estúdios de cinema. Para Andy, pode acontecer justamente um escapismo que acaba por tomar a atenção completa dos gestores, eles ficam ocupados demais, eles querem se ocupar.

### Reflections on the professional identity and perceived threats 

The insight from a research cited by "Are You Afraid to Identify as a Leader?, has shown that how challenge it is to support the developement of leaders as the consideration of a self-identity of a leader, has brought reputational concerns. As an example, employees might fear being seen as autocratic, different, or unqualified, when they consider themselves to embrace the role of leaders. Their research  suggests that organizations can impact the development of leaders and support a viewpoint that affects the psychological standpoint as taking leadership roles can be viewed as positive, and can be shown to be an area that is oriented to skills, and not as an innate ability: 

> "In one study, we found that participants who listened to a podcast in which we framed leadership as risky were less likely to identify or act as leaders than those who listened to a podcast that described leadership as low-risk. This suggests that simply by presenting leadership as less risky and lower-stakes (for example, by clarifying that leadership mistakes are expected and will not be a black mark on an employee’s record), managers can help employees feel more comfortable seeing themselves as leaders." https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Why would perceptions of riskiness influence something as deeply ingrained as your identity? From a psychological standpoint, however, this effect is not surprising at all. No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might think." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "And across our studies, we found that people who reported higher levels of fear around these reputational risks were less likely to see themselves as leaders. As a result, they were less likely to act as leaders, and therefore less likely to be seen as leaders by their supervisors." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader 

### Don't fear fear, and protections at the team level 

Poderia até parecer controverso a ideia de medo ser uma motivação mas agora já bem separamos medo das possíveis ações em consequência - defesa, censura, ataque.

Agora podemos nos tornar protagonistas que atuam entre as emoções e os sentimentos e podem melhor definir passos estratégicos antes dos gatilhos e dos hábitos automáticos.

A autora Letícia Lago, no livro Clienterapia, alerta seus leitores sobre uma condição típica por exemplo onde pessoas no supermercado correm o risco de levar mais produtos em promoção por medo da escassez. [Verificar a página do livro da Letícia clienterapia]. Ela nos lembra que não vivemos mais em uma época de escassez, ou seja, nós mesmos estamos criando a resposta automática.

Então não queremos responder automaticamente aos medos. Tudo começa com a iniciativa de reconhecer e não ter medo de sentir medo.

A visão positivista para o empreendedor protagonista com relação ao medo é justamente não sentir medo do medo.

Com essa ideia nós vamos além do fato de não entrarmos naturalmente em uma posição defensiva ou de não nos censuramos.

Nós podemos ainda procurar sonhar e antecipar situações de medo. Sem medo do medo e reconhecendo que você pode ter um papel de protagonista você antecipa possíveis situações e trabalha nelas fora do tempo fora da hora H o que é muito melhor e pode ser feito contando com a colaboração de outros.

Agora, na versão micro, do empreendedor, o que podemos tirar dessas ideias? Primeiro, que nós somos ativos e somos nossos protagonistas, mesmo quando simplesmente estamos nos podando, nos censurando; mesmo que muitas vezes fazemos isso de forma automática, sem pensar. Segundo, que é natural que às vezes vamos engajar em medidas de defesa e ignorar a situação crítica que causa medo e bloqueio - isso e uma forma de defesa nossa.

One idea is to transcend the outcome, create a model where there is a meta-outcome after the outcome, thus you have a protection system so that you can also lift fears. As an example, you can be okay to destroy the sucess, as part of your success.
