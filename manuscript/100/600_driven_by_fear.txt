# Fear drive

Fears can move mountains. We should consider that idea to respect the role of fear in modern entrepreneneurship, especially in the fast-paced world. If we set our time machine to somewhere 30000 to 36000 years ago, and find a human on a tree fearing the fearless wolf that paciently waits, we can visualize - and respect - that feeling which improves the chances for survival in the face of the danger. Someone in your ancestors tree feared some treat so that you are reading this book and able to feel the situation of when fear is iminent. But back to the future of our present, the metaphor that fears can move mountains makes more sense now, especially now that the knowledge economy surfs in the digital landscape. Now the mountain is a pile a resources where we take evergy from, wolves are competitors, and the organization is like a tree where we can go up and down and hopefully survive so to be able to reflect and paint the situation of what happens in a stone around the corner.

And if some of this sounds far from where we live, I fear that we must confront, or celebrate, or simply accept the fact that narratives driven by fear are so naturally administered into the veins of our corporate body that we don't even make a sense of how our now-networked brain responds. And all of this becomes serious given that the startup situation deals with treats as projections, more than real treats. As in, growth is ahead, or risk or prizes are ahead; thus there is the implied element of risk analysis and the potential that larger sums of resources are to be deployed so that growth happens. In other words, a lot is based on signals, or perceptions, therefore less related to real treats or iminent risk. But the complication, and the reason for us to be together, is that the entrepreneurial agenda does not allow room to discuss our fears, or the role of fear, or how fear drives productivity, such as how fear eloquently shapes narratives that affects our decisions. 

To note, or to narrow our scope, the setting of a startup has usually a few people on board. The founders, or the family, have power of authority. In other words, although the moutain of resources is not huge, it is huge enough to impact your future. With that, and depending on the circunstances of what is ahead, we know that people can be more or less fearful. And, although we don't generally characterize teams, or divisions, as fearful, we will explore how the constituents turn fears into narratives that are powerful to change directions. Unfortunately, the matter of fear is not generally addressed, or properly, in work situation. If a team member had the courage to put straightforward such as "I am afraid of going in this direction" it would perhaps be a call for a discussion. But reality is that fear chimes differently, sometimes hidden, such as when an authority says "I fear that we will be killed by our competition if we keep ignoring them." Therefore, in this chapter, let's respect fear as an element that pushes the entrepreneur's journey, the pace and the path of innovation. 

Let's start with visualizing fear in the work situation first, how we experience it in ongoing conversation of the day - at the interpersonal level. THen we will explore how the individual is highly influenced by fears of treats to a value system in an ongoing narrative, and tricks to explore different point of views to come up with awareness and revisit decisions. With that, we more to other reflections where fear is recognized as present from the individual level to the management situation of large organizations. As we move on to not supress fear, and note or acknoledge fear, we shall identify and accept how fear enters the communication of teams, and impacts their decisions in the everyday, as it causes blockage, defense, censorship, or attack. 

### When the stakes are high  

This [project] will blow up! Is what I once heard from my manager, after he had invited me into a weekly meeting. I think that he feared a dead end if we didn't act in a different way. Perhaps, as we were not doing enough, that we could put more effort or do things in a different way. What is interesting - now in retrospect - is that it didn't cross my mind to offer a support to him, to his fear. Perhaps that inaction was just part of the mood we were in, the mood that gave the title of "war room" to the room where most of our effort was coordinated, like a sacred space for getting things done. I won't ever forget those words. It was unavoidable to foresee a future where we would not exist, our team, and consequently myself as worker of a well known and respected Silicon Valley company, and myself as an immigrant in US. 

A few years later, when was back to the office in another Silicon Valley company, I caught a post-it over the keys of my laptop. It was written that "Things are not working yet." I picked the post-it and brought it to the vice president, which happen to be who hired me. To which he replied that "this is unacceptable in America." I won't ever forget his reaction, how he has protected myself within 9 seconds, which made me safe; although 24-hours later he has communicated that he was not anymore working for that company, and that I was yet onboard. I don't know if any of that were connected, I don't know exactly what has happened. Anyway, in retrospect, I think that he feared that the company lacked a more transparent or ethical communication, that he feared about my chances to thrive in that organization, among other fears.  

WIth these examples, I am not searching that management is driven by the dramatic moves where fears are key motivation. But it is undeniable that fear chimes in a range of levels such as a more softly perceived fear to up to what others refer as raw fear. What is most important, at this stage of reflection, has more to do with respecting that fear in the corporate setting appears more like a hidden beast behind the scene. In other words, constituents are able to feel the emotion, as they identity treats and attacks, that that pulls them to come up with a narrative that can be quite colorful, quite real, and meaningful. 

### The works in the head 

Thus, relevant in the entrepreneur's context is the censorship that becomes decisive when we acknowledge fears. If having fear while dreaming, reflecting, or planning leads you to self-censor, then this issue with fears needs to be resolved. It's not a simple task, such as reading pages of a book, because it involves taking initiative and to engage in reflective thinking, to put things in perspective, such as what comes from reflective writing or other related processes that involves asking for help, just like one would when one enters a session with a psychoterapeut, or a coach, or board members. 

Author Julia Cameron, known for her book "The Artist's Way," assists artists from various fields in navigating their creative potentials and blocks. Her 12-week course, which is outlined in the book, includes one of the most intriguing exercises called "morning pages." This exercise entails writing three pages every morning—an essentially liberating practice that exercises the mind, much like a gym for the body, allowing the censoring side of the mind to cease stifling creativity. It's essentially a technique that encourages making mistakes without fear, beginning with granting oneself permission.

Through Julia's explanations, we can see how she discovered this technique throughout her career. She was a recognized artist in Hollywood who, at some point, had her work rejected (please verify this information around page 40 in the book). In her account of the emotions she experienced, she likened the feeling of her work's rejection to the loss of a pregnancy.

## Fear associated with and values  - could this be a complication? 

Perhaps this association is more common in the world of artists or those involved in more creative work. But why is that? Maybe it's because these types of work are produced not just with hours of labor, but with a tremendous amount of energy. Some individuals, through their projects, are truly expressing who they are, even if that expression of identity isn't explicit or direct. They still express themselves because they become the conduit for those ideas. This concept, where the artist is the conduit or the messenger of identity, can help us explain the emotions and feelings of loss that are experienced in critical work situations when they occur.

People don't experience feelings of loss or pain at work solely because they've become workaholics. In fact, they engage deeply, and their identity is intertwined with how they deliver their work, how they get things done. What happens is that when things go awry, such as when projects are abruptly terminated, when layoffs are necessary, or when an entire division needs to be closed, they not only feel compassion for the people who have been affected, but they also feel as if they were the ones who kept things on track. They were the messengers or the train conductors. Just as a train conductor is happy when the train is running smoothly and feels sorrow when it's no longer operational, in the context of entrepreneurship and businesses, imagine the protagonist who did more than just accelerate or control the train and transport passengers from one place to another.

Imagine the protagonist who was genuinely involved in the original plan that turned ideas into tangible realities in the world, achieved significant milestones, brought happiness to people, and discovered new opportunities. It's natural for a person's identity to be linked to that of the responsible protagonist, emotionally connected to the world they've created. Suddenly, due to various external factors or even management issues and competition, these protagonists may find themselves facing situations reminiscent of loss. They may experience fear and emotions akin to losing a loved one.

## How we experience - Fear triggers actions 

We want to feel emotions, we want to recognize fear, we want to allow ourselves to be vulnerable. With these exercises, you can embrace fear so that you can explore possibility, mapping rissks and possible actions. The entrepreneur that embraces their fear, which allow the conflict and asks for help, is one that engages into the collaboration process; which is a big idea in the sense that it has to do with allowance for a wider view, a different perspective, which opens the door for an actual wiser view about the entreprneurship, as opposed to the constraints of the identity of the role that promotes the journey, such as the particular reality of a founder. The allowance for disucssions of fears, the conscious discussions about how fears are translated into the narratives, means a seed for the culture that is a truth seeking culture. 

Doug Leone, partner of Sequoia Capital, explains how he keeps himself motivated and seeking for more which is challenging as he is part of one of the most sucessful venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, which would naturally put him into a situation of a comfort zone. 

> "When you are successful a little bit, the greatest danger you have is the fact you were successful. " Doug Leone (Brazil at Silicon Valley, 2019, 7:02)

He added that ""**raw fear**", is what motivates him; as he recalled the days when he would walk at the Stanford Shopping center, in 1988, making about 67000 dólares per year, knowing that he didn't have enough money to buy gifts. (Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2014, 45:22). And went on to recognizing the fears that kept him to work, such as fear of being lay-off from Sequoia, fear of messing up with the life of entrepreneurs. Thus, for Doug, fear is a motivation force. 

### How we experience - Andy Grove 

Andy Grove também compartilhou uma ideia parecida, de medo como força que motiva a criatividade e também a ação - medo de perder em relação ao competidor, medo do produto não ser bom para clientes, etc. Para Andy Groove, (????) existe uma sequência de emoções que são similares às emoções da perda de pessoas queridas, que podem ser vividas por pessoas questão no meio de situações que ele chamou de pontos de inflexão. [Colocar o exemplo de Andy, sequência da perda da pessoa querida, seguido da sequência no domínio da empresa que vive o ponto de inflexão. ]

O próprio Andy revela que ele escreveu um dos seus livros no meio de uma dessas jornadas turbulentas que a Intel passou em torno de 198x [conferir em Let Chaos Reign] - sugerindo que naquela situação ele poderia estar escapando de reconhecer a situação.

O que tiramos disso, é, mais uma vez uma ideia simples mas que não podemos ignorar - somos humanos, nos sentimos e vamos nos envolver e vamos provavelmente coordenar nossas ações de empreendedorismo em função das emoções. Mas isso não significa que não podemos tirar tempo para reconhecer e refletir sobre isso tudo. Se o ex-CEO  da Intel reconhece que estava escapando do problema maior ao escrever um livro será que nós também as vezes engajados em certas ações responsáveis como forma de bloquear ou como autodefesa para não corrermos o risco de sentir perda ou sentir emoções fortes como medo e insegurança?

Andy Grove ainda articulou uma versão corporativa do potencial da perda, a auto defesa - uma situação onde empresas que estão passando pelo dito ponto de inflexão, decidem compras outras empresas. Ela perguntou, em Only the Paranoid Survive, por que será que empresas de eletrônicos do Japão, que viveram mudanças grandes em seus mercados e indústria, compraram estúdios de cinema. Para Andy, pode acontecer justamente um escapismo que acaba por tomar a atenção completa dos gestores, eles ficam ocupados demais, eles querem se ocupar.

## Complication expanded 

Agora, na versão micro, do empreendedor, o que podemos tirar dessas ideias? Primeiro, que nós somos ativos e somos nossos protagonistas, mesmo quando simplesmente estamos nos podando, nos censurando; mesmo que muitas vezes fazemos isso de forma automática, sem pensar. Segundo, que é natural que às vezes vamos engajar em medidas de defesa e ignorar a situação crítica que causa medo e bloqueio - isso e uma forma de defesa nossa.

### Fearing fear and professional identity design 

> "At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. Why would perceptions of riskiness influence something as deeply ingrained as your identity? From a psychological standpoint, however, this effect is not surprising at all. No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might think." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader

> "And across our studies, we found that people who reported higher levels of fear around these reputational risks were less likely to see themselves as leaders. As a result, they were less likely to act as leaders, and therefore less likely to be seen as leaders by their supervisors." - https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader 

## Exercise of projecting 

Para resolver isso, o primeiro passo é reconhecer, observar. Também vale o exercício de refletir em momentos protegidos, não debaixo de pressão, como por exemplo usar a técnica apontada no capítulo "correntes alternadas" para permitir paralelizar exercícios que lhe ajudam a mitigar os medos e mapea-los de fato. Neste sentido vale o exercício apontado por Tim Ferriss, em Trabalhe 4 horas por semana, ... [Colocar o exercício do Tim Ferriss aqui]

Escrever o que pode acontecer de fato é uma forma de planejamento. Uma vez mapeado, aquilo que era medo de algo que não se sabe, torna-se um mapa mais estratégico. Nessa atividade você acaba colocando os passos intermediários que são necessários para resolver o problema.

Agora, tratamos de medo que cria bloqueio ou censura, uma vez que exercitamos nossa capacidade de sermos criativos vamos nos acostumando a ideia de escrever, rascunhar, conversar, planejar; essa atividade que nos permite sair da zona da paralisia e partir para a ação. Com isso faz sentido aquele pensamento que diz que o corajoso é o medroso que deu o passo; ou que o louco é o corajoso que não tem medo.

## Don't fear fear, and protections at the team level 

Poderia até parecer controverso a ideia de medo ser uma motivação mas agora já bem separamos medo das possíveis ações em consequência - defesa, censura, ataque.

Agora podemos nos tornar protagonistas que atuam entre as emoções e os sentimentos e podem melhor definir passos estratégicos antes dos gatilhos e dos hábitos automáticos.

A autora Letícia Lago, no livro Clienterapia, alerta seus leitores sobre uma condição típica por exemplo onde pessoas no supermercado correm o risco de levar mais produtos em promoção por medo da escassez. [Verificar a página do livro da Letícia clienterapia]. Ela nos lembra que não vivemos mais em uma época de escassez, ou seja, nós mesmos estamos criando a resposta automática.

Então não queremos responder automaticamente aos medos. Tudo começa com a iniciativa de reconhecer e não ter medo de sentir medo.

A visão positivista para o empreendedor protagonista com relação ao medo é justamente não sentir medo do medo.

Com essa ideia nós vamos além do fato de não entrarmos naturalmente em uma posição defensiva ou de não nos censuramos.

Nós podemos ainda procurar sonhar e antecipar situações de medo. Sem medo do medo e reconhecendo que você pode ter um papel de protagonista você antecipa possíveis situações e trabalha nelas fora do tempo fora da hora H o que é muito melhor e pode ser feito contando com a colaboração de outros.

### Fearing the projected identity 

The insight from a research cited by "Are You Afraid to Identify as a Leader?, has shown that how challenge it is to support the developement of leaders as the consideration of a self-identity of a leader, has brought reputational concerns. As an example, employees might fear being seen as autocratic, different, or unqualified, when they consider themselves to embrace the role of leaders. Their research  suggests that organizations can impact the development of leaders and support a viewpoint that affects the psychological standpoint as taking leadership roles can be viewed as positive, and can be shown to be an area that is oriented to skills, and not as an innate ability: 

> "In one study, we found that participants who listened to a podcast in which we framed leadership as risky were less likely to identify or act as leaders than those who listened to a podcast that described leadership as low-risk. This suggests that simply by presenting leadership as less risky and lower-stakes (for example, by clarifying that leadership mistakes are expected and will not be a black mark on an employee’s record), managers can help employees feel more comfortable seeing themselves as leaders." https://hbr.org/2022/09/are-you-afraid-to-identify-as-a-leader


### Shifting the prize/evaluation in the role

One idea is to transcend the outcome, create a model where there is a meta-outcome after the outcome, thus you have a protection system so that you can also lift fears. As an example, you can be okay to destroy the sucess, as part of your success.
