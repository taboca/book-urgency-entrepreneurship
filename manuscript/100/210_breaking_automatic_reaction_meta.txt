## SCqA 

* Subject - Deals with the denial of execution with no room allowed for breaking present needs. 

* Situation - Things gains traction. Gaps show. We can fix. It's nice. You will respond, with execution to fix. 
* Complication - You can be wasting time, you can't see from perspective. Worse? You just started to make it work, and how you have to reinvent? 
* Answer - For growth, embrace future. 

* pitch - objections - rain on your parade. 
* pitch - objections - we are learning. 
* pitch - objections - how long should we push? 

* Editorial - note - creative and style. In Rambo I, first blood, when Rambo destroys the city, Cel Trautman comes to the police station to talk with Rambo, commanding him - it's over. But Rambo is not okay with that idea, although he starts to find the actual confrontation that he has to turn it off. Rambo accepts to go to jail with the support from his protector, his real coach.
