The concept that we have to "find time" for things is deeply rooted in our culture. We often prioritize productivity, efficiency, and busyness. The complication is that this "view" is likely the case for many of us that are no masters in productivity, that are not efficient. 

This cultural mindset presents time as a finite resource that we must manage carefully to achieve success and fulfillment.

The phrase "find time" implies that time is a scarce resource that's elusive, and we must search for it amidst our other commitments. This view can contribute to feelings of stress, overwhelm, and inadequacy, as it seems there's never enough time to do everything we want or need to do.

The idea of time scarcity can also lead to comparisons and envy, as you mentioned in relation to Julia Cameron's work. If we see others seemingly having more time, we might perceive them as being more successful in managing their lives, which can cause feelings of jealousy.

Victimization of time is a notion that we are at the mercy of time. It implies that we are not in control, but rather are victims of external circumstances, unable to make meaningful choices about how we spend our time. This victim mentality can be detrimental, as it disempowers us and impedes our ability to take active control of our lives.

However, it's important to challenge these narratives. While it's true that time is a limited resource, it's also true that we have some degree of control over how we choose to use it. Recognizing this can empower us to spend our time in ways that align with our values and priorities.

Instead of thinking about "finding" time, we might reframe our approach to think about "making" time. This subtle shift in language reflects a proactive stance, suggesting that we can shape our own schedules and prioritize what's important to us.

To combat the idea of time scarcity, we can also practice mindfulness, which encourages us to be fully present in the moment, rather than anxiously rushing from one task to the next. This can help us to appreciate the time we have, rather than constantly feeling like it's slipping away.

Lastly, it's helpful to remember that everyone has the same amount of time in a day. While it might appear that some people have more time, what's often different is how they choose to use it. Comparisons can be harmful, and it's more productive to focus on managing our own time in ways that align with our unique needs and goals.
