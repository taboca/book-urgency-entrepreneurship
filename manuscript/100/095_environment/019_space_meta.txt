# Outline v0.6

* General - Now breaks in Space (Bridge, Bundle and Unbundle, Growing, Bundle Valley) and Transcending Space (JTBD zoom levels)
* @Outline - Pitch - Need to be shorter - our spaces are frameworks and modern world materializes platforms. Let us see how platforms are formed and how a lot is entangled; Just like people act on a box and the environment, where all happens; entrepreneurs too can be enchanted by the notion of the dilemma within the box, using essentally building blocks given by economic models. 
* @outline - Situation - Pitch SCqA - we can be so into a domain, a way for building things, we embrace the possibilities of new platforms, and builing became easier. Consider #Rails #God
* @outline - Situation - From not able to believe in #automated transports to being okay around #cars
* @outline - Complication - For entrepreneurs, the act within a platform is essentially additions, sometimes we may not notice us doing entrepreneurship that can be business as usual too. 

* @outline - Space - The formation of a platform, as an outcome of a space of opportunity, solves another. 
* @outline - Space - Answer - Entangled spaces - multiple entangled spaces and Bundle and Unbundle 
* @outline - Space - Answer - Bundle and and unbundle - multiple entangled spaces and Bundle and Unbundle. 

* @outline - Transcending - Pitch - How to proceed to innovate, what to do vs. how to do and why to do?
* @outline - Transcending - Situation - Being involved with empathy for the problem and the solution 
* @outline - Transcending - Situation - Innovation management is concerned with that - JTBD - innovator's dilemma - still, how to be involved and find the relationship?
* @outline - Transcending - Complication - Variability and identification of the sweet spot and MD case - interest to transcend execution towards business. [Feat. MD]
* @outline - Transcending - Answers - GK - Recognition of transcending - caring beyond leads to no action but may be recognized,  GK - Stability target, GK - Stability source

# Outline v0.3

* [x] Pitch - Need to be shorter - our spaces are frameworks and modern world materializes platforms. Let us see how platforms are formed and how a lot is entangled; Just like people act on a box and the environment, where all happens; entrepreneurs too can be enchanted by the notion of the dilemma within the box, using essentally building blocks given by economic models. 

* @outline - Situation - of incremental and disruptive brings us to recognize the enviroment is a framework?
* @outline - Situation - Consider #Rails #God
* @outline - Situation - Then we are on top #Milkshake 
* @outline - Complication - For entrepreneurs, they aren't imune to this, they are people too and even more that a lot of what they do departs from having empathy. Furthermore the tools they use are too platforms tools, which in essence gives them leverage power which is irresistible. 

* @outline - Answer - has to do with the notion of bundle and unbundle - for the spaces

* @outline - Complication - We can be tied, difficult to get out, but then platforms emerge disrupt and then again,  #Rails
* @outline - Complication - Ridiculous some of the things, we just don't get it. #gel #belly

# Outline v0.1

* @outline - All happens in a space; People needs depends on the space they act; And the space in a way becomes a framework for getting things done, which we may comply or reinvent. 

* @outline - Situation - On top of a platform or framework?
* @outline - Situation - Ridiculous some of the things, we just don't get it. 

* Outline - Complication - Entrepreneurship can be trapped in the space.

## Points

* from 300_entry_points.txt - * Marcio and the Google Well-being app - (title: The lost world of apps) For weeks now I am using the Well-being app by Google, quite interesting name, which allows an interesting option, it enables me to check off, turn off, all Android apps. This case helps to make the point about the competition of UI elements, and also the "organized flow" of certain events, such as notifications, that comes my way with a small screen device. Since the Android is more connected, modern, the Android has more connections with knowing what all apps do, and channels it, controls it. The safety of the marketplace, which generate trust to use, retro feed the trust of actions to be in the control of Google, and then all that has permissions, then becomes like habits that are system-level. Consideing that the device is a sort of extension of my body at this point - which is likely not unfair to say, then the impact, the extension is receiving notifications for all the sort of things, such as messages from family, friends, bank notifications, entertainment, leisure, system updates, social network updates. It's like all the birds of a country are sent over my tour all together. Or, if you were visiting a Jurassic Park, if they give you all the dinossaurs at the same time. Wait, let me run from the t-rex first, then have an icecream, then go back to face the velociraptor. The system-level attachment with multiple stories of all the apps which I have subscribed - and note that installing is a form of subscription too - can't account the storied context of all the apps in synch with my own storied context. I would need my grandmother to help me as my parents are busy too. But I am alone and I am no composer or conductor. It's a lot of noise if you could hear all events of updates as dinossaurs screams. 

* from 300_entry_points.txt - When I was reading the book entitled Foco Roubado, Stolen Focus, and the story of the 66 yo professor researcher in the field of willpower, Roy Baumeister, author of Willpower, and reading what Roy told him Johann, that the professor used to be able to seated, reading and writing, and not anymore; that now he thinks that his mind jumps a lot more from one activity to another; it reminded me of my great insightful experience that I have called Uber University, when I became an Uber driver for one year, for 1000 trips. The insight I found was that u was able to replace the radio with YouTube videos. I have told passengers that I was learning English and if they were okay with the audio. Then then, long story short, only on Fridays, I was able to watch about 120 talks. Yes I had to polish a process, over time, such as to put a bit of effort to curate my playlist, not perfect but making sure I went to the streets with about 10 talks in the same theme. Then I wrote about that amazing experience of productivity. I have reported, later trying to convince many Uber drivers to do that, that it didn't take many months for me to think I was a sort of expert in the field of entrepreneurship. When explaining to many other app drivers, as we call them in Brazil, many have agreed that on the computer, or a mobile screen, the user interface offers too many notification systems on our way. I miss the days of driving and just listening and sometimes replaying parts of the audio talks as they were full of insights. The app driver university pack I created could work like an university.

## How we experience a world of distraction and it is not entirely our fault 

* The case of Apps Android and Google Well-being. 
* Notion of bundle and unblunde and combinatorics?
* Notion of being bundled ourselves.
