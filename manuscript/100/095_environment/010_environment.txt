* outline - Entrepreneurship shapes our environment, we get into it, it is the way to get things done. 
--> 

That entrepreneurship happens in the environment, we know, and along how it influences the environment. While I can't say that COVID-19 had accelerated the adoption of a modern way of ordering at some coffee shops in Brazil, it clearly gave me an opportunity to compare the before and after. Before, I remember that I used to seat and ask the waiter for the menu if not a coffee at once. After, on the other hand, the waiter asked me to take a photo of a image on a table so that I can access the menu for ordering from there. 

That brings us to the inescapable - and sometimes quite surprising - truth that things do stick around and change our lives. And, as well, to wonder about the supporting factors that brings these new tunes to the spaces where we live. As an example, and if I were not so hungry and paused to reflect, I would perhaps notice the complexity and the many things that needed to be in place for that simple request to work. Like the Internet that needed to be on, the necessity of a smartphone, and for it have a camera. And as for my finger is concerned, the interface means to for it to tap the camera icon in the device's screen, which would then bring another graphical interface, of the menu, with the various kinds of coffee. But take these technologies and platforms and interfaces aside, there is too the necessity of a language. One that guides the beginner, perhaps not unlike the language of a professional dancer that conducts the novice, such as one that says to "just take a photo of that image on your table and you will be able to order directly to the kitchen." Now if these can be seen as some characterizations of an environment, we shouldn't forget that the new tune is sustained in harmony with the movement of an economic model background, which is likely the case that influenced the owners of that coffee place to chose that modern ordering system.

* Outline - Complication - The environment of entrepreneurship is the opportunity and can be the trap.  [feat. Sam Altman] 
--> 


This view of how things are entangled, or nested, can be a complicated situation for many entrepreneurs or a concern for the entrepreneurial function. This circles back to our starting point "that entrepreneurship happens in the environment" and that 'it influences the environment," which I shall better elaborate. Because our environment sets our living conditions, given by the space of technologies and platforms and interfaces like tools and the language of words given by the world around us, we are well positioned to use the environment as the reference point of our perspective. And this is not bad - entrepreneurs know that - given that it is the enviroment is the grounded reference to jump to act, such as to improve something or even to propose change to the whole situation. 

But the concerns of the entrepreneurial function of a higher order worry that entrepreneurs can be trapped by the environment even when they think that they can be executing the entrepreneurial function. In other words, while many may think that they are challenging a situation with something new, it is complicated as they can be provoking some of the characterizations but not well enough provoking themselves to think outside the box, as a result of themselves being trapped and too involved to the given economic or a cultural environment they live.  We can this by thinking that it is the dilemma of the entrepreneur - what to do? And as well to celebrate the complicated situation that they are in hurry to act, to be somebody, and the carry on what needs to be done, the execution. As an example, while entrepreneur might be trying to improve the engine of a car, another one with another perspective might be trying to remove the necessity of the car. Now to shift ourselves to a perspective that transcends further, let us celebrate the concern from Sam Altman about the voices, or the lack of voices, of modern Silicon Valley that to a certain extent may put at risk the potential for innovation: 

> *"More recently, I’ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for intelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension leave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so toxic. “If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical” was a memorable quote I heard this year."* Sam Altman, https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

He also had considered: 

> *"Political correctness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage."* Sam Altman,  https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

Thus if a dilemma sets in, it is not the core of the concern, likely supported by the urge to do something and not to be living the dilemma. But yet that by celebrating the relativeness of our entrepreneurial environment, and how entangled our environment is, can give us an opportunity to be aware that we are essentially trapped within boundaries, such as trapped without living any worries, such as trapped under limits and boundaries, which indeed is thinking inside the box or outside a box and yet within another; and well enchanted by an entrepreneurial movement that while for us provokes a system it may be, for others, just a form of a movement that that is business as usual, from the perspective of that higher-order entreprneurial function. 

Now if the concern from Sam Altman is seen as one of a kind - if we worry about the entrepreneur movement that explores the limits such as to propose extending life as we know it - one would be missing the nuanced observation and provocation that can serve to all sorts of movements and not to the ones pushing our world to the limits; which is the importance to celebrate the forces of our environment, especially the ones motivating us to act and influencing our perspectives. 

In other words, if we celebrate this chapter, we are using some of our precious time to reflect about our urge to do something and to be somebody - such as busy writing applications for smartphones as we know it or coming up with a new spaceship factory company inside a virtual game - wull take us to build something but yet always anchored to certain boudaries and perspectives such as the values that we hold that will set our perspectives for how we respond when we think about the future. When I visited my car's mechanic, a couple years ago, and asked him about the potential rise of eletric cars in Brazil, his reasons for why it wouldn't work were mostly market reasons and less to do with what could be thought of as higher values such as the environmental impact to the planet or other moral or even religious concerns. But to think that way, I caught myself when writing this, I would be missing the point that there are no lower or higher values and what really matters is that the values given are usually enough for driving our entrepreneurial action. In other words, if one justifies the reality of a market to judge if something is a go-no-go then this one is likely aware of the characterizations of that market, which could be generally considered a good thing the idea that many of us understand what are markets. 

Therefore, and if we are to consider how we are bounded to our environment, we shouldn't miss the celebration that the possibilities for doing things might be expanded given the abundance of possibilities offered by the platforms of our modern world. It is a good thing that a lot can be done and that human potential can be busy building things by using the tools and methods and frameworks and systems and networks and a lot more doing all of that with good expectations and also in harmony with others. There is that happening in the world and it is worth celebrating.

However, it comes from that too that the world of possibilities given by our environment can greatly impact many to, for lack of a better word, to be trapped or thinking in the box. In other words, there is a lot of movement that might be considered as entrepreneurial movement but in fact, if taken from perspective, can be considered to be business as usual. And there is nothing wrong with that as the bricklayer that builds houses carries the main element of the true entrepreneurs - the ability to get things done. What matters for all the entrepreneurs - not matter what they the bits and pieces that they are layering - is that being aware of their environment - tools or platforms or methods or the playbooks or a marketplace or else - is important as they should understand and interpret the obvious things - like boundaries or limits and possibilities - but also the meaning for themselves and from the perspective of where they are going such as the view for the startup growth and the business in the long run. 

Let us continue to celebrate some aspects that shapes our environment, starting first with a moment to think about the formation of platforms espeically that more digital platorms are layered in our lives; and to to consider how what we do is highly influeced by the shapes and form of the interfaces of tools we have, the things we interact with. And furthermore that our environment is also constructed by the minimal tools for collaboration, our vocabulary, the words that people use to do the things they want to do.
