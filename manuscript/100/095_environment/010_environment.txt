--> 






If entrepreneurship cares so much about people, why is it that the movement builds so incessantly so many complex things to a point of generally missing the needs of people? This complication is well-spoken by top-tier advisors from all corners of the startup world, incessantly reminding entrepreneurs to focus on the problems of their customers, not on solutions [^footnote_focus_problems]. 

Granted, the advice is precious. But so precious indeed that we shall take it further to remind our own advisors that the very methods we use to listen to our customers - like when a founder does an interview over the phone or using an online form - are given by existing solutions. If that's not enough a reason to consider the impact that the environment produces to our movement as entrepreneurs, we shall too celebrate the inescapable fact that the entrepreneurial function cannot hack directly into people's lives, that it only does so by indirectly modifying our spaces, by providing solutions such as technological solutions. In other words, and given that entrepreneurs are essentially normal people working and specialists in getting things done, we shall then ask ourselves if the prior movement of entrepreneurship, given through the environment, has in any way the power to set our direction as in telling us how we build, what we build, and even why we build.

[^footnote_focus_problems]: Generally, after many phenomenon widely observed, it may be observable too the rise of widely-known materials; one of them is the book from Uri Levine, the co-founder of the popular the navigation and transit application entitled Waze, entitled *Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs* (2023); as a well-thought response to help entrepreneurs deal with the phenomenon where the rush towards solution-centric approaches potentially places genuine innovation at risk.

Not different from our prior chapter, where we had considered the movement that entrepreneurs do as they identify themselves with groups, similarly, we shall now consider the movement that happens by the  environment of entrepreneurship - defined by its methods, platforms, tools and more - an environment is now rich enough to influence our trajectory, especially when they are in a hurry.

This entanglement produces effects observable if we zoom out, or in, when we look at the whole entrepreneurial movement, or when we look to the subtle movements of our day. As for the first, Sam Altman [^footnote_samaltman], of Y Combinator, had considered how the voices, or the lack of voices, in modern Silicon Valley is a determinant in the movement of innovation:

* Outline - Complication - The environment of entrepreneurship is the opportunity and can be the trap.  [feat. Sam Altman] 
--> 

It's inescapable, after listening to the words of Sam Altman and especially knowing that he's the CEO of OpenAI, to not get involved somewhat in the merit and get even uncomfortable about how technology can affect our future. But the implicit message is really more uncomfortable - and more important to for entrepreneurs and their environment - as that it speaks how the hands of investors are given as a response from their views, and their values. And how powerful that is - the supporting system that decides, what shall be boosted, what shall scale, which in fact sets in a not so visible hands in terms of building blocks, given by the technologies, by platforms, and the means for buildings things, by the perspectives for what to do which we so much get to value. 

Which brings us to wonder about the practical effects of the environment to our daily function of getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]; where in necessity of a pragmatic movement, especially in the beginning, teams get practical under a potential of being drifters, diving in a actual directed movement very much set by characterizations in terms of how to get things done for their domain-specific environment, or by navigating through the market to a certain extent. As an illustration we may look at the early days of Airbnb, when they were "AirBedAndBreakfast.com," and consider how characterizations of their domain impacted them to dream or to give up, as the interview given to Reid Hoffman suggests: 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can create the conditions for an entrepreneurial function that is obsolete; which may be observable in part if we consider that many people think they are entrepreneurs while they might be building something too simple from the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction or to be considered as business as usual.

This passage may not ring a bell if you haven't created websites before. But to think that a potential writer - in her early stages finds helself browsing the digital shelves and - changes her path too soon after she hears the "bells of the competition" because she found a similar title, suggests the possibility that she is measuring the opportunity by the given perspectives, such as the market as seen in the present, but moreover that such perspectives of that entrepreneurial domain, an specific domain, actually frames the movement to a certain extent thus becoming an environment that is highly influential in the beginning. In other words, it prevents them to listen as if they're trapped within the walls of a cathedral which they thought in the first place were the actual way, giving them purpose, even with hopes of transcending. 

I call our attention, on the other hand, to a rhetorical illustration of an inspector, a particular kind that chimes in and sees everyone in the room under the suspicions that a serious crime has happened - the consideration of the kidnapping of the team's attention. If so, the objection likely sets in where his comments shall be dismissed as in one that is actually asking silly questions, if not the actual source of distraction. If this objection sets in, it might be in part because of a truth we all know, from a value-force and a driving force of entrepreneurship, one that tell us that "the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena," [^footnote_roosevelt_arena]. In other words, that external eye that chimes in, the critic that suspects, is likely the one to be seen as the weak; likely as being quickly contrasted with the actual team in the arena, that carries the reputation as real doers. 

In reality, these doers are seen as the ones that seek advices, as the ones that cares about their domain, as the ones getting the applauds for showing a bit of their market research skills, perhaps a bit ahead in the game. But we know too, that they know, or that they get to know eventually, that execution matters more in the long run. That seems to be the case for Airbnb, as history shows. Airbnb's long run execution brought them there.

While they didn't do that other idea they too it further going back to their prior idea - the "AirBedAndBreakfast.com" - and turned that into "Airbnb.com," which gave them a strenght in their domain, to grow stronger, to form a strong involved with their community, to become leaders of their community, which gave them the conditions to survive the forceful attack of a major competitor [^footnote_airbnb_competition] on their way, and which brought them, in the end, to make millions of hosts [^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts] and their guests happier.

[^footnote_roosevelt_arena]: Theodore Roosevelt's speech "Citizenship in a Republic," popularly known as "The Man in the Arena," emphasizes the value of perseverance and effort. What might be remarkable too is how the modern world is fast to take certain great parts from it such as the part made the speech to be remembered as *The Man in the Arena*: "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles... The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena..." (Roosevelt, 1910). 

[^footnote_airbnb_competition]: According to Brian's interview in *Brian Chesky on Launching Airbnb and the Challenges of Scale* (2015), the Samwer brothers emerged targeting Airbnb by exercising their proven ability to clone successful business models and rapidly scaling them, often outpacing some of the original innovators. Although they posed a significant challenge, Airbnb's unique value proposition and strong community engagement enabled them to thrive against such competition.

[^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts]: Since its inception in 2007, Airbnb has experienced phenomenal growth, evolving from a small startup where two hosts welcomed three guests to their home in San Francisco to a global platform with over 5 million hosts, according to "About Us," retrieved from https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/.

It is certainly unfair, therefore, to even imagine that whatever concrete which was seen by that early team - as they visited that web site, "roommates.com" - had a stake in defining the future of Airbnb, such as to consider a semi-arbitrary movement to have such power. Yet, it doesn't isolate them from the consequences of that practicality, or pragmatism, in the arena, where they act themselves as a driving force of their very movement that accelerates them, that takes them to turn, or to a certain extent to be following instincts. To consider, the slightest possibility, that a the judgement of a leader within the group [^footnote_kahneman_noise_group] may strikingly turn on the engine of the team to follow, might be then a reason for a pause, at least for a reflection, at least in this very moment. We shall too reflect how our team's applauds to the leader's voice is never done like a fanfare - which could call everyone's attention to think twice - but it is fast and smooth, given by what now are digital Likes, digital Claps, digital Thumbs up, of a digital and fast-paced collaborative medium. If we pause this ride we shall then celebrate how our domain, our spaces, our environment, the whole thing around us are in fact setting ourselves and framing our judgements. A support to that line of inquiry may be given by the distinction between judgement and thinking given by *Noise* by Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein (2021):

> *"Judgement should not be confused with 'thinking.' It is a much narrower concept: judgement is a form of measurement in which the instrument is a human mind. Like other measurements, a judgement assigns a score to an object. "* (p. XX)

[^footnote_kahneman_noise_group]: In their discussion in Chapter 8 of *Noise*, Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein examine the influence of group dynamics on judgment and decision-making. They highlight how groups can add complexity to these processes, noting that even seemingly irrelevant factors—like the order in which team members speak—can steer decisions in arbitrary directions.

Especially in the beginning, when these founders might act like benevolent dictators or autocratic executors [^footnote_michaeldearing_benevolent_dictators_or_autocratic], it rises a movement that silences the voice of that slower critic, the curious mind that sees things under the suspicions. Conversely, we might be acting, in fact, as the world's fastest critic, however, by following our instincts given by the perspectives that there are faster ways to get there. We might be augmenting the voice of the market, to serve our needs, instead of listening to it or trying to see across.

[^footnote_michaeldearing_benevolent_dictators_or_autocratic]: In the 2015 Greylock Blitzscaling 03 talk, "Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction," (2015, October 8) Michael Dearing and Reid Hoffman discuss two perspectives on how startups might best be led during their formative stages. Dearing supports a "benevolent dictatorship" where the founder, while retaining ultimate decision-making power, listens to and integrates team feedback. Conversely, Hoffman considers the "autocratic" approach where decision-making is concentrated in the hands of one or a few, which suggests efficiency.

@outline @meta
* Outline - Answer - By celebrating the formation of things around, like platforms, technologies, interfaces, and the language, we can reflect on the relativeness that entrepreneurial becomes powerful and powerfully obsolete alltogether. [Feat. Schumpeter]
--> 

We shall then ask ourseles - are we halfway directed by the set of elements that characterizes our environment? Are we halfway directed by the tools or methods of the given platforms? We might be halfway driven following the lights of an horizon given by the goggles we use, the very goggles that gives our hopes. Are we following an invisible playbook spoken by the whole environment instead of looking to see through? The framing of these questions allow us to wonder about how the space around us changes the ways for building things. 

In other words, while the entrepreneurial function used to build from a world made of natural things, such as water, fire, earth and wind, and love, now our function exercises its potential from a second nature, from the world we made by the concretes we have made, like tools, processes, and products. What is certainly good news, given by the new elements to build a future, yet carries the power of love, which is a curious thing, as it's strong, it's sudden, and even cruel sometimes. Uri's book title is a great reminder of that, of we fall in love with solutions, with customers, processes, platforms, markets, networks, you name it. 

If we travel back in time, we would certainly expect from the things yet to be created to be things to improve our capacity, to improve our perception, to serve as methods of comprehension - for a future that hasn't been written yet. It would be quite difficult to consider that the abundance and richness of methods for building things, would, to a certain extent, influence us in ways as in to become methods of control [^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control].

[^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]: The consideration to think of technologies influencing our movements, like to control the process to a certain extent is motivated by *The Technological Revolution: Notes on the Relationship of Technology, Science, and Culture* from Peter Drucker and his notes such as "But 'knowledge' changed its meaning from being 'understanding', i.e., focused on man's mind, to being 'control', i.e., focused on application in and through technology." It should be noted Peter's awareness that "It would be claiming too much to say that technology established itself as the paramount power over science." But to his consideration that "it is technology that gives the union of the two its character; it is a coupling of science to technology, rather than a coupling of science and technology" (Drucker, P. (2011). p. 152. Routledge. Original work published 1970).

<!--

* reference - Drucker, P. (2011). Technology, Management and Society. Routledge. (Original work published 1970)
-->

Or, in other words, could it be that the the more technological concretes in our spaces could prevent us to see a horizon by the very fact that the goggles to see the world are given by technologies we had produced? 
In other words, again, if things could be telling us what to do, how to do, and why to do; especially when we are empowered to urgently advance by taking advantage of its richness, we shall take ourselves to celebrate how our spaces are being formed by our movement and the challenges of entrepreneus that are in a position of using things from the space while at the same time willing to change their space.
