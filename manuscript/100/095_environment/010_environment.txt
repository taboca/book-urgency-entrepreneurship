If entrepreneurship is so interested in serving people's needs, why is it that in its urgency to do, it builds so many and complex things that even misses the actual needs of people? This phenomenon can be heard from advisors that urge many entrepreneurs to focus on the problems of their customers, not on technology or solutions. Granted, that the advice is precious, except that in the urgency to do so we generally miss that we are learning about people's needs using existing technologies that affects our views - like special goggles - or we may miss that many of the building blocks for building things set us half-way to complete a solution. 

Thus it may be worth to consider the implications that as the entrepreneurial function can't hack into people's lives directly, and as it does so by changing the environment first, the fruits of the prior movement happens to hack our lives as builders - how we build, what we build, and why we build. The effects of this entanglement may be observable as we zoom out or in, as it influences the whole entrepreneurial movement and also the subtle movements of ourselves as doers. 

As for the first, a moment of listening to a leading character from one of the richest innovation hubs in the world - Sam Altman of Silicon Valley, Sam Altman of YCombinator, and more recently the Sam Altman of OpenAI [^footnote_samaltman] - especially his concern about the voices, or the lack of voices, of modern Silicon Valley that to a certain extent puts at risk his high hopes for the potential for innovation: 

[^footnote_samaltman]: Sam Altman's insights into the cultural and innovative dynamics of Silicon Valley are informed by his extensive experience in the tech industry, particularly through his role as the former president of Y Combinator, one of the most successful startup accelerators globally.

'If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical' was a memorable quote I heard this year."* (Altman, 2017)

But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims. The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage."* Sam Altman,  https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

* Outline - Complication - The environment of entrepreneurship is the opportunity and can be the trap.  [feat. Sam Altman] 
--> 

If we celebrate the concerns of Sam Altman, it may give us a moment to reflect on how the entrepreneurial environment shapes the entrepreneurial function, not anymore by any fierciful or fearsome hands, but by the denial of the investment that may be necessary, as investors can pick which kind of innovation they want to invest, therefore by the stronger and invisible hands that can boost entrepreneurs or scale them up. 

Furthermore, the effects of these influences from this backstage brings us to zoom in and consider that the getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone] of the everyday is a reflection of values not only of values outspoken but because a direction is given by the currents, by the available platforms, by available tools, methods, and more; as if the building blocks were telling us what to do. 

As an illustration, let's consider the reflection from Brian Chesky about how their early team weren't excited after having noticed that someone else had built a website that seemed similar to some of their ideas: 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can lead to the entrepreneurial function to be obsolete.

> *"In fact, ... we started exploring creating a roommate matching website. ... Until one day, we typed 'roommates.com' [into the browser] and realized somebody had already built that site. ... And this was like three weeks or four later, and I said, 'Why the hell didn't anyone type that site in the first day? Because I just wasted four weeks.' [Laughter]."* (Chesky, Brian, 2015, 6:29)

@todo @meta
* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment Space - Consider to bring ideas from Joseph Schumpeter as Marcio is talking about the situation of abundance of solutions in a space - which it might have to do with the unrealistic exploration by Schumpeter that the entrepreneurial function is not needed if all needs are satisfied - but know too that where Marcio is going is that needs are too created, so spaces can be a trap plus the hint of leisure from Schumpeter might be a case to consider too. Nevertheless the saturated situation of Schumpeter can be realized. @meta-refid 1212-2233-3433-3933
* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment - Add a footnote about Schumpeter and the notion that the entrepreneur is essentially one that executes an entrepreneurial function of getting things done. @meta-refid 1212-2233-4433-9494

To contextualize, there is not enough data in the given interview to know why they gave up that direction. But what is given from Brian's interview brings a truth that entrepreneurs recognize - that the domain they choose to innovate comes with an environmental domain. While for us that does not ring the bell as a reason to give up something, an entrepreneur that worked with internet sites from 2000 does recognize the feeling of loss when one sees an idea similar to be available using a nice and simple internet domain name. As an aside, and given that Brian's team had decided to move on with AirBedAndBreakfast.com (which later became available through Airbnb.com,) we shall infer that their more than 4 million [^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts] hosts, and their guests, would be happy to know that back in the early days roommates.com were taken. 

[^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts]: Since its inception in 2007, Airbnb has experienced phenomenal growth, evolving from a small startup where two hosts welcomed three guests to their home in San Francisco to a global platform with over 5 million hosts, according to "About Us," retrieved from https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/.

* Outline - Answer - By celebrating the formation of things around, like platforms, technologies, interfaces, and the language, we can reflect on the relativeness that entrepreneurial function becomes obsolete in a way but yet thriving it another way. [Feat. Schumpeter]
--> 





Furthermore, and especially that now in retrospect we can well tell the style of execution from Brian and the Airbnb team, a calmer reflection sets in anyway and can consider that if they went further with that roommate thing, they would have executed quite well; which is basically an acknowledgment of a principle reminding us that execution matters more. But along with that, and exactly because of that, then we are right in the place to be again puzzled by how these "little" things can so meaningfully impact our days of execution anyway. 

To be clear about our exploration and context, we are thinking about the impact of an environment, like an environmental domain, has on us. Concerned with the possiblity that a dynamic environment is given to entrepreneurs, like a space for them to explore a space, that they are invited by platforms by the platform movement and potential, that they are invited by tools, by its methods and its playbooks. Thus, that the modern and richer and networked situation will produce such a major impact on us, with well-informed ways to do, well-informed reasons to do, allowing us to respond, as if we were doers responding to prompts given by the rich entrepreneurial environment. 

Let us continue to celebrate some aspects that shapes our environment, starting first with a moment to think about the formation of platforms espeically that more digital platorms are layered in our lives; and to to consider how what we do is highly influeced by the shapes and form of the interfaces of tools we have, the things we interact with. And furthermore that our environment is also constructed by the minimal tools for collaboration, our vocabulary, the words that people use to do the things they want to do.
