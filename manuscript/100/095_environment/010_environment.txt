If entrepreneurship cares so much about people, why is it that the movement builds so incessantly so many complex things to a point of generally missing the needs of people? This complication is well-spoken by top-tier advisors from all corners of the startup world, incessantly reminding entrepreneurs to focus on the problems of their customers, not on solutions [^footnote_focus_problems]. 

Granted, the advice is precious. But so precious indeed that we shall take it further to remind our own advisors that the very methods we use to listen to our customers - like when a founder does an interview over the phone or using an online form - are given by existing solutions. If that's not enough a reason to consider the impact that the environment produces to our movement as entrepreneurs, we shall too celebrate the inescapable fact that the entrepreneurial function cannot hack directly into people's lives, that it only does so by indirectly modifying our spaces, by providing solutions such as technological solutions. In other words, and given that entrepreneurs are essentially normal people working and specialists in getting things done, we shall then ask ourselves if the prior movement of entrepreneurship, given through the environment, has in any way the power to set our direction as in telling us how we build, what we build, and even why we build.

[^footnote_focus_problems]: Generally, after many phenomenon widely observed, it may be observable too the rise of widely-known materials; one of them is the book from Uri Levine, the co-founder of the popular the navigation and transit application entitled Waze, entitled *Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs* (2023); as a well-thought response to help entrepreneurs deal with the phenomenon where the rush towards solution-centric approaches potentially places genuine innovation at risk.

Not different from our prior chapter, where we had considered the movement that entrepreneurs do as they identify themselves with groups, similarly, we shall now consider the movement that happens by the  environment of entrepreneurship - defined by its methods, platforms, tools and more - an environment is now rich enough to influence our trajectory, especially when they are in a hurry.

This entanglement produces effects observable if we zoom out, or in, when we look at the whole entrepreneurial movement, or when we look to the subtle movements of our day. As for the first, Sam Altman [^footnote_samaltman], of Y Combinator, had considered how the voices, or the lack of voices, in modern Silicon Valley is a determinant in the movement of innovation:

* Outline - Complication - The environment of entrepreneurship is the opportunity and can be the trap.  [feat. Sam Altman] 
--> 

What's inescapable from the viewpoint of Sam Altman - where we should recognize too his role as the CEO of OpenAI - is the reflection about how the entrepreneurial environment is influenced by the hands of investors which act given by their values, thus what they choose, to boost and scale, impacts the availability of tools, especially in a world where tools are delivered and distributed as technological platforms.

Which brings us to wonder about the practical effects of the environment as we exercise the daily function of getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]; which we generally recognize and accept as good news as otherwise getting things done isn't possible, our wondering shall transcend the basic needs  of doing and is concerned with the situation of us to be directed by these means, such as directed by the means of specific domains. As an illustration we may look at the early days of Airbnb, when they were "AirBedAndBreakfast.com," and consider how characterizations of their domain impacted them to dream or to give up, as the interview given to Reid Hoffman suggests: 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can create the conditions for an entrepreneurial function that is obsolete; which may be observable in part if we consider that many people think they are entrepreneurs while they might be building something too simple from the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction or to be considered as business as usual.

And this was like three weeks or four later, and I said, 'Why the hell didn't anyone type that site in the first day? Because I just wasted four weeks.' [Laughter]."* (Chesky, Brian, 2015, 6:29)

--> 

The passage may not ring a bell, if you haven't created websites. But the fact that a potential writer in the early stage - when browsing the shelves of a digital bookstore - finds herself silenced by the "bells of the competition," when she finds a similar title, suggests a perspective that sets in framed by the domain. It prevents them to listen, as in within the walls of a cathedral which they brought themselves in the first place, the one that had given to them the initial purpose. 

However, on the other hand, if an outsider sees them in the room under the suspicions that a serious crime has happened - such as to consider the kidnapping of the team's attention - he may well be dismissed as a dumb inspector, or as one asking silly questions and being who acts causing the distraction. This objection sets in because we all know that truth from a value-force or driving force of entrepreneurship, because we feel the truth that "the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena," [^footnote_roosevelt_arena]. In other words, being them the ones in the arena of entrepreneurship, we get to see right there, during the act, so many nice things - like a normal routine of a team that cares or even a hint about their awareness about market research. We know, that in the end of the day, their affairs will take them to seek advices, that as much as they do they do double check the things they do, as they go. 

We know that they know, or that they get to know, eventually, that execution matters more, in the long run. That seems to be the case for Airbnb, as history shows, that their long-run execution (themselves in the arena) had brought them there. While they didn't do that other idea they too it further going back to their prior idea - the "AirBedAndBreakfast.com" - and turned that into "Airbnb.com," which gave them a strenght in their domain, to grow stronger, to form a strong involved with their community, to become leaders of their community, which gave them the conditions to survive the forceful attack of a major competitor [^footnote_airbnb_competition] on their way, and which brought them, in the end, to make millions of hosts [^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts] and their guests happier.

[^footnote_roosevelt_arena]: Theodore Roosevelt's speech "Citizenship in a Republic," popularly known as "The Man in the Arena," emphasizes the value of perseverance and effort. What might be remarkable too is how the modern world is fast to take certain great parts from it such as the part made the speech to be remembered as *The Man in the Arena*: "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles... The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena..." (Roosevelt, 1910). 

[^footnote_airbnb_competition]: According to Brian's interview in *Brian Chesky on Launching Airbnb and the Challenges of Scale* (2015), the Samwer brothers emerged targeting Airbnb by exercising their proven ability to clone successful business models and rapidly scaling them, often outpacing some of the original innovators. Although they posed a significant challenge, Airbnb's unique value proposition and strong community engagement enabled them to thrive against such competition.

[^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts]: Since its inception in 2007, Airbnb has experienced phenomenal growth, evolving from a small startup where two hosts welcomed three guests to their home in San Francisco to a global platform with over 5 million hosts, according to "About Us," retrieved from https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/.

Therefore, it is unfair, or surreal, to imagine that a concrete was seen by that early Airbnb team as they quickly visited "roomates.com." And that it had a stake in defining the future of Airbnb. Yet, it doesn't isolate them from the consequences that themselves being actually in fact in the arena were too such a driving force taking them too to accelerate, or to turn, or to follow instincs to a certain extent. To consider, the slightest possibility, that a the judgement of a leader within the group [^footnote_kahneman_noise_group] may strikingly turn on the engine of the team to follow, might be then a reason for a pause, at least for a reflection, at least in this very moment. We shall too reflect how our team's applauds to the leader's voice is never done like a fanfare - which could call everyone's attention to think twice - but it is fast and smooth, given by what now are digital Likes, digital Claps, digital Thumbs up, of a digital and fast-paced collaborative medium. If we pause this ride we shall then celebrate how our domain, our spaces, our environment, the whole thing around us are in fact setting ourselves and framing our judgements. A support to that line of inquiry may be given by the distinction between judgement and thinking given by *Noise* by Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein (2021):

> *"Judgement should not be confused with 'thinking.' It is a much narrower concept: judgement is a form of measurement in which the instrument is a human mind. Like other measurements, a judgement assigns a score to an object. "* (p. XX)

[^footnote_kahneman_noise_group]: In their discussion in Chapter 8 of *Noise*, Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein examine the influence of group dynamics on judgment and decision-making. They highlight how groups can add complexity to these processes, noting that even seemingly irrelevant factors—like the order in which team members speak—can steer decisions in arbitrary directions.

This view may give us a moment of reflection, especially in the beginning when founders might be benevolent dictators [^footnote_michaeldearing_benevolent_dictators_or_autocratic] or autocratic executors, about how smoothly a movement arises that silences the voice of that critic. We might, for a moment, think if we might be acting as world's fastest critic, such as when founders don't even blame but dismiss that as a sort of "dumb inspector and his silly theory that team had commited the serious crime of the kidnapping of the team's attention." We may well be augumenting the voice of the market [^footnote_michaeldearing_marketspeaks] to serve our needs. Or we might be acting as if trying to decide from our reasoning as in to comprehend the space around us, but actually given by the ways we see things given by the domain that we immersed.

[^footnote_michaeldearing_benevolent_dictators_or_autocratic]: In the 2015 Greylock Blitzscaling 03 talk, "Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction," (2015, October 8) Michael Dearing and Reid Hoffman discuss two perspectives on how startups might best be led during their formative stages. Dearing supports a "benevolent dictatorship" where the founder, while retaining ultimate decision-making power, listens to and integrates team feedback. Conversely, Hoffman considers the "autocratic" approach where decision-making is concentrated in the hands of one or a few, which suggests efficiency.

@outline @meta
* Outline - Answer - By celebrating the formation of things around, like platforms, technologies, interfaces, and the language, we can reflect on the relativeness that entrepreneurial becomes powerful and powerfully obsolete alltogether. [Feat. Schumpeter]
--> 

We shall then ask ourseles - are we halfway directed by the set of elements that characterizes our environment? Are we halfway directed by the tools or methods of the given platforms? We might be halfway driven following the lights of an horizon given by the goggles we use, the very goggles that gives our hopes. We we following an invisible playbook spoken by the whole environment? If we augment the possibility that a movement invades the entrepreneurial movement, such as to recognize the possibility of noise in what is not generally heard as noise, we shall raise the necessity for being conscious about the influence that the things created have on us; especially now that we live in a world that has changed - from an entrepreneurial function building things from a world of natural things, as in the made of the water, fire, earth, wind, and love, to building things from world, or a second nature, where our building blocks were given by the prior movement while love continues to act on it if not taking us to act in a hurry. 


More than searching for the precise answer, it is the setting of this perspective by asking questions that may invite us to consciously wonder if the prior movement of entrepreneurship actually influences by the very given things that we have created in the first place. In other words, while the entrepreneurial function used to build from a world made of natural things such as water, fire, earth and wind, and love, the new function exercises its building power on a second nature, although love is still an active ingredient, specially accelerating our movements. That perspective ask us to consider the possibility that the things created - from technology - which we had great hopes of it to be to serve us as methods for comprehension (to trully see a world and what is possible) had become potential methods influencing us, like methods of control [^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]. Or, in other words, could it be that the the more technological concretes in our spaces could prevent us to see a horizon by the very fact that the goggles to see the world are given by technologies we had produced? 

[^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]: The consideration to think of technologies influencing our movements, like to control the process to a certain extent is motivated by *The Technological Revolution: Notes on the Relationship of Technology, Science, and Culture* from Peter Drucker and his notes such as "But 'knowledge' changed its meaning from being 'understanding', i.e., focused on man's mind, to being 'control', i.e., focused on application in and through technology." It should be noted Peter's awareness that "It would be claiming too much to say that technology established itself as the paramount power over science." But to his consideration that "it is technology that gives the union of the two its character; it is a coupling of science to technology, rather than a coupling of science and technology" (Drucker, P. (2011). p. 152. Routledge. Original work published 1970).

In other words, again, if things could be telling us what to do, how to do, and why to do; especially when we are empowered to urgently advance by taking advantage of its richness, we shall take ourselves to celebrate how our spaces are being formed by our movement and the challenges of entrepreneus that are in a position of using things from the space while at the same time willing to change their space.
