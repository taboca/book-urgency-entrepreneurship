# Environment 

That entrepreneurship happens in the environment, we know, and with that that the environment influences the entrepreneurial function, such when it gives us the motivations to act. Thus, from that entrepreneurial action, as it does its job, impact to the environment happens like the space of a coffee shop or it may change the rules or methods that influences what people in other spaces. We know too that the sum of other impacts can go all the way to change the actual whole environment like of our planet which worries environmentalists in the first place. 

And we know too that the economic movement is the necessary element that makes something to stick to the environment, to a point of impacting our lives or to trully change the world. And likewise, that this movement happens grain by grain - incrementally - or that it can be disruptive. When I moved to Silicon Valley, in the early 2000s, I used to bike to the office using a device called the *Danger Hiptop* [^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop] which could make people worried about my behavior of riding and browsing the Web at the same time. I would say that I was the first to do that in the world. But then and fast-forward 24 years, it now seems too normal that people don't even care that how the food delivery drivers in Brazil can ride and look on their smartphone screens installed in their bike's handlebar. They might be just too busy or hungry to eat their pizza. As a side note, it took me years to come up with a theory that it was their speeding - and occasionally them performing wheelies - the reason why some of the pepperoni slices would shift from their designated half to invade the Margherita space.

[^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop]: The Danger Hiptop, also known as the T-Mobile Sidekick, was a pioneering mobile device that predated the widespread emergence of contemporary smartphones. Developed by Danger, Inc., this innovative gadget was notable for its unique design, featuring a flip screen and a full QWERTY keyboard, which made it particularly popular among a younger demographic seeking a mobile device for messaging and internet browsing. One of its most forward-thinking features was its internet browser, which operated by exchanging bits and pieces of images from a remote browser, a technique that was considered ahead of its time ir not a workaround since making a full browsing in the device would be impossible.

For a better illustration, we can compare how normal it is for someone to be comfortably seated in a car, listening to a hip-hop song, nursed by a thick milkshake large enough to last for the whole traffic jam; with the not-so-far back in time days where some of us where uncomfortable by the chugs and hisses of the early locomotives and even motivated to curse, as reported by Maury Klein in The Power Makers:

 > *"As rails spread across the land, opposition came from canal owners, some states that had invested heavily in canals, turnpike and bridge companies, stagecoach lines, tavernkeepers, and anyone who saw his business threatened by the railroad. Some people even raised religious and moral objections. An Ohio's school board warned in 1828 that 'if God had designed that His intelligent creatures should travel at the frightful speed of 25 miles an hour by steam, He would have foretold it through His holy prophets. It is the device of Satan to lead immortal souls down to Hell.'" (Klein, 2009, p. 57)

With these comparisons my intention is to invite us to celebrate, first, that the changes that created our environment strongly sets our perspectives and how we respond when we think about the future. When I visited my car's mechanic, a couple years ago, and asked him about the potential rise of eletric cars in Brazil, his reasons for why it wouldn't work were mostly market reasons and less to do with what could be thought of as higher values such as the environmental impact to the planet or other moral or even religious concerns. But to think that way, I caught myself when writing this, I would be missing the point that there are no lower or higher values and what really matters is that the values given are usually enough for driving our entrepreneurial action. In other words, if one justifies the reality of a market to judge if something is a go-no-go then this one is likely aware of the characterizations of that market, which could be generally considered a good thing the idea that many of us understand what are markets. 

Therefore, and if we are to consider how we are bounded to our environment, we shouldn't miss the celebration that the possibilities for doing things might be expanded given the abundance of possibilities offered by the platforms of our modern world. It is a good thing that a lot can be done and that human potential can be busy building things by using the tools and methods and frameworks and systems and networks and a lot more doing all of that with good expectations and also in harmony with others. There is that happening in the world and it is worth celebrating.

However, it comes from that too that the world of possibilities given by our environment can greatly impact many to, for lack of a better word, to be trapped or thinking in the box. In other words, there is a lot of movement that might be considered as entrepreneurial movement but in fact, if taken from perspective, can be considered to be business as usual. And there is nothing wrong with that as the bricklayer that builds houses carries the main element of the true entrepreneurs - the ability to get things done. What matters for all the entrepreneurs - not matter what they the bits and pieces that they are layering - is that being aware of their environment - tools or platforms or methods or the playbooks or a marketplace or else - is important as they should understand and interpret the obvious things - like boundaries or limits and possibilities - but also the meaning for themselves and from the perspective of where they are going such as the view for the startup growth and the business in the long run. 

Let us continue to celebrate some aspects that shapes our environment, starting first with a moment to think about the formation of platforms espeically that more digital platorms are layered in our lives; and to to consider how what we do is highly influeced by the shapes and form of the interfaces of tools we have, the things we interact with. And furthermore that our environment is also constructed by the minimal tools for collaboration, our vocabulary, the words that people use to do the things they want to do.
