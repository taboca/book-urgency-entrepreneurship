# Environment 

That entrepreneurship happens in the environment, we know, and with that that the environment influences the entrepreneurial function, such when it gives us the motivations or reasons to act. Thus, from that entrepreneurial action, as it does its job, impact to the environment happens, like the space of a coffee shop or it may change the rules or methods that influences what people in other spaces. We know too that the sum of other impacts can go all the way to change the actual whole environment like our planet which worries environmentalists in the first place. 

And we know too that the economic movement is the necessary element that makes something to stick to the environment, to a point of impacting our lives or to trully change the world. And likewise, that this movement happens grain by grain - incrementally - or that it can be disruptive. When I moved to Silicon Valley, in the early 2000s, I used to bike to the office using a device called the *Danger Hiptop* [^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop] which could make people worried about my behavior of riding and browsing the Web at the same time. I would say that I was the first to do that in the world. But then and fast-forward 24 years, it now seems too normal that people don't even care that how the food delivery drivers in Brazil can ride and look on their smartphone screens installed in their bike's handlebar. They might be just too busy or hungry to eat their pizza. As a side note, it took me years to come up with a theory that it was their speeding - and occasionally them performing wheelies - the reason why some of the pepperoni slices would shift from their designated half to invade the Margherita space.

[^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop]: The Danger Hiptop, also known as the T-Mobile Sidekick, was a pioneering mobile device that predated the widespread emergence of contemporary smartphones. Developed by Danger, Inc., this innovative gadget was notable for its unique design, featuring a flip screen and a full QWERTY keyboard, which made it particularly popular among a younger demographic seeking a mobile device for messaging and internet browsing. One of its most forward-thinking features was its internet browser, which operated by exchanging bits and pieces of images from a remote browser, a technique that was considered ahead of its time ir not a workaround since making a full browsing in the device would be impossible.

A more drastic example would be how we felt surprised not so long ago when locomotives first appeared, and then how to be driving and moving by a machine just seems so natural. Let us celebrate how those moving big things had scared some people back in late 1700s, with a quote brought my Maury Klein in the book Power Makers: 

> *"If God wanted.... "* Maury 

It may be so that some of us are worried about self-driving cars now, how dangerous they could be. But all of the entrepreneurs will agree that the environment is a reference point and it is from that that they explore the space of opportunity, especially when it creates the demand, when their imagination and creative potential is being called, and it then that they feel empowered to do something about it.

Now from that too there is a complicated situation for entrepreneurs, that the environment influences them and their entrepreneurial actions and how they experience the world in every single way. They may be motivated to change something about the environment, or they may comply and enhance something, or they may be mad enough to rethink a given space in the environment. And as they do, the experience and how the perspectives and how they experience the environment is all connected not only with the environment, but also with the tools and the systems and the entities and the interfaces that they interact with. Furthermore, as they communicate and collaborate, it's also part of the environment, the vocabulary and the words that people use, and the cultural... and culture. So let us consider to pause for a while and reflect about some of these aspects of the environment in the hope of being a trip.
