* outline - Entrepreneurship shapes our environment, we get into it, it is the way to get things done. 
--> 

That entrepreneurship happens in the environment, we know, and along how it influences the environment. While I can't say that COVID-19 had accelerated the adoption of a modern way of ordering at some coffee shops in Brazil, it clearly gave me an opportunity to compare the before and after. Before, I remember that I used to seat and ask the waiter for the menu if not a coffee at once. After, on the other hand, the waiter asked me to take a photo of a image on a table so that I can access the menu for ordering from there. 

That brings us to the inescapable - and sometimes quite surprising - truth that things do stick around and change our lives. And, as well, to wonder about the supporting factors that brings these new tunes to the spaces where we live. As an example, and if I were not so hungry and paused to reflect, I would perhaps notice the complexity and the many things that needed to be in place for that simple request to work. Like the Internet that needed to be on, the necessity of a smartphone, and for it have a camera. And as for my finger is concerned, the interface means to for it to tap the camera icon in the device's screen, which would then bring another graphical interface, of the menu, with the various kinds of coffee. But take these technologies and platforms and interfaces aside, there is too the necessity of a language. One that guides the beginner, perhaps not unlike the language of a professional dancer that conducts the novice, such as one that says to "just take a photo of that image on your table and you will be able to order directly to the kitchen." Now if these can be seen as some characterizations of an environment, we shouldn't forget that the new tune is sustained in harmony with the movement of an economic model background, which is likely the case that influenced the owners of that coffee place to chose that modern ordering system.

This view of how things are entangled, or nested, can be a complicated situation for many entrepreneurs or a concern for the entrepreneurial function. This circles back to our starting point "that entrepreneurship happens in the environment" and that 'it influences the environment," which I shall better elaborate. Because our environment sets our living conditions, given by the space of technologies and platforms and interfaces like tools and the language of words given by the world around us, we are well positioned to use the environment as the reference point of our perspective. And this is not bad - entrepreneurs know that - given that it is the enviroment is the grounded reference to jump to act, such as to improve something or even to propose change to the whole situation. 

But the concerns of the entrepreneurial function of a higher order worry that entrepreneurs can be trapped by the environment even when they think that they can be executing the entrepreneurial function. In other words, while many may think that they are challenging a situation with something new, it is complicated as they can be provoking some of the characterizations but not well enough provoking themselves to think outside the box, as a result of themselves being trapped and too involved to the given economic or a cultural environment they live.  We can this by thinking that it is the dilemma of the entrepreneur - what to do? And as well to celebrate the complicated situation that they are in hurry to act, to be somebody, and the carry on what needs to be done, the execution. As an example, while entrepreneur might be trying to improve the engine of a car, another one with another perspective might be trying to remove the necessity of the car. Now to shift ourselves to a perspective that transcends further, let us celebrate the concern from Sam Altman about the voices, or the lack of voices, of modern Silicon Valley that to a certain extent may put at risk the potential for innovation: 

> *"More recently, I’ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for intelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension leave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so toxic. “If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical” was a memorable quote I heard this year."* Sam Altman, https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

He also had considered: 

> *"Political correctness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage."* Sam Altman,  https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

Thus if a dilemma sets in for some entrepreneurs might be less of a concern; while more should be given to the inclination and the urge to do something that has no time for any dilemma. And if the concern from Sam Altman is seen as one of a kind - if we worry about the higher expectations of the highest kind of entrepreneur movement that can be prevented by values - we would be essentially missing the nuanced observation that can help all entrepreneurs in all situations, which starts with the celebration that the forces of our environment are quite strong, and are the ones motivating us to act and influencing our perspectives. 

Furthermore, that a celebration for how entangled our environment is, can give us an opportunity to reflect and see that the boundaries for us are limited by a set of values we anchor ourselves to, values which are getting richer or that too are giving us well-informed reasons or our actions but nevertheless have an influence on our perspectives for then how we respond as for what we want to do and build as builders. 

As an example of how values shift, consider a visit I did to my car's mechanic, a couple years ago when I had asked him about the potential rise of eletric cars in Brazil, whereas his reasons for why it wouldn't work were were quite informed market-oriented reasons and less to do with what could be thought of as higher values such as the environmental impact to the planet or other moral or even religious concerns. In other words, if one justifies the reality of a market to judge if something is a go-no-go then this one is likely aware of the characterizations of that market, which could be generally considered a good thing the idea that many of us understand what are markets. But as much as that idea means to be celebrating the well-informed citizen, likely supported by the wide adoption of means to access information, it also shows how the realities that we have created, such as the market realities of our environments, become new factors on our ways to set the limits for what we do. 

In other words, many of us can be satisfied by "thinking outside the box" that can be a mere exploration or a tinkering within another wider box that is not at all being challenged; which is other words is to say that a provocation to a system of values which may sound quite provoking might be about doing business as usual within another and unseen envinronmental box of values. 
Therefore, and if we are to consider how we are bounded to our environment, we shouldn't miss the celebration that the possibilities for doing things might be expanded given the abundance of possibilities offered by the platforms of our modern world; but too that such expansion is also an expansion that can take our attention.

It is a good thing that a lot can be done and that human potential can be busy building things by using the tools and methods and frameworks and systems and networks and a lot more doing all of that with good expectations and also in harmony with others. There is that happening in the world and it is worth celebrating. And there is nothing wrong with that as the bricklayer that builds houses carries the main element of the true entrepreneurs - the ability to get things done. 

What matters for all the entrepreneurs - not matter what they the bits and pieces that they are layering - is that being aware of their environment - tools or platforms or methods or the playbooks or a marketplace or else - is important as they should understand and interpret the obvious things - like boundaries or limits and possibilities - but also the meaning for themselves and from the perspective of where they are going such as the view for the startup growth and the business in the long run. 

Let us continue to celebrate some aspects that shapes our environment, starting first with a moment to think about the formation of platforms espeically that more digital platorms are layered in our lives; and to to consider how what we do is highly influeced by the shapes and form of the interfaces of tools we have, the things we interact with. And furthermore that our environment is also constructed by the minimal tools for collaboration, our vocabulary, the words that people use to do the things they want to do.
