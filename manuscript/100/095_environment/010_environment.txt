Nevertheless the saturated situation of Schumpeter can be realized. @meta-refid 1212-2233-3433-3933

* outline - Entrepreneurship shapes our environment, we get into it, it is the way to get things done. 
--> 

That entrepreneurship happens in the environment, we know, and along how it influences the environment. While I can't say that COVID-19 had accelerated the adoption of a modern way of ordering at some coffee shops in Brazil, it clearly gave me an opportunity to compare the before and after. Before, I remember that I used to seat and ask the waiter for the menu if not a coffee at once. After, on the other hand, the waiter asked me to take a photo of a image on a table so that I can access the menu for ordering from there. 

That brings us to the inescapable - and sometimes quite surprising - truth that things do stick around and change our lives. And, as well, to wonder about the supporting factors that brings these new tunes to the spaces where we live. As an example, and if I were not so hungry and and pausing to reflect, I would perhaps notice the complexity and the many things that needed to be in place for that simple request to work. Like the Internet that needed to be on, the necessity of a smartphone, and for it have a camera. And as for my finger is concerned and able to tap the camera icon, the icon had to be clearly acessible in the device's screen and interface, which would then bring another graphical interface of the menu of the various kinds of coffee, and as well today's suggestion at the top. But take these technologies and platforms and interfaces aside, there is too the necessity of a language. One that guides the beginner, perhaps not unlike the language of a professional dancer that conducts the novice, such as one that says to "just take a photo of that image on your table and you will be able to order directly to the kitchen." 

Now if these are examples of a characterizations of an environment, we shouldn't forget that for any new tune to be sustained, there should be the movement of an economic model going on harmoniously in the background; which is likely the case that convinced the owners of that coffee store to chose their ordering system. Which brings us to a slightly complicated situation for us entrepreneurs.

* Outline - Complication - The environment of entrepreneurship is the opportunity and can be the trap.  [feat. Sam Altman] 
--> 




This complicatiom may not really be a complication for many but it can be complicated too even when they don't it. And it circles back to our starting point "that entrepreneurship happens in the environment" and that 'it influences the environment." In other words, our living conditions where we get to experience all these spaces and interfaces and words creates the environment for people to live and interact which brings about the opportunity for the entrepreneurial function, indeed, the one that cares about improving things and sometimes to propose changes to our realities. But it becomes complicated exactly because entrepreneurs are people too, their live in the enviroment too, and they abide by a lot of the given movement such as the economic movement. 

Thus a dilemma set in. That entrepreneurs might not even see that indeed they are able to improve certain spaces and improve the lives of the ones in there, but they too can be trapped within certain boundaries of the spaces, or to be thinking inside the box in a way. Therefore, the level of access in terms of challenging the boundaries of the spaces can be relative, and this relativeness, depending on the industries and the culture and circumstances, can also become trapped for entrepreneurs. As an example, an entrepreneur might be trying to improve the engine of a car, and from another perspective some others may try to rethink the entire necessity for using cars. To point how this concern is expressed, consider the concerns from Sam Altman in his article where he is worried about the voices or the lack of voices in Silicon Valley that could put in risk the innovation potential.

> *"More recently, I’ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for intelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension leave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so toxic. “If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical” was a memorable quote I heard this year."* Sam Altman, https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

He also had considered: 

> *"Political correctness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage."* Sam Altman,  https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

With the intention of allowing us to move ahead with this theme and the concerns about us entrepreneurs being trapped within boundaries, sometimes not being able to see the transformations that are imminent or the possibilities, I will call this attempt to materialize the idea of a space. So think that this is the space where opportunity may happen. The idea of this space involves limits or boundaries, and if you're indeed thinking inside the box, and if this space is where people live and do things, it is then the space where you can propose changes, although in general changes are proposed within the space exactly because it is a space of interaction, where people are generally respecting each other or in a way playing by the rules. 

And exactly by considering the perspective of the limits and the actual metaphorical reference that any space of unlimited space or that certain rules are applying, we may then find ourselves invited to the very considerations when the space can be reconsidered, where the limits or the boundaries of a given reality can be reconsidered, which is also part of what entrepreneurial action does. And in matter of fact, real entrepreneurial action or more innovative the solution is, the more impactful the solution is, it is likely one that rethinks these boundaries and limits of a given space, and by rethinking it creates a new reality, which usually has ties with the development of a whole economy, and by creating a new economic model, these spaces impact social and cultural aspects, therefore creating a new space of opportunity. That essentially may touch the subject of creative destruction, if we think in more macro terms. But this idea may be applicable at any level in general, and if we are to follow on that, I would like to also bring about some considerations from the idea of bundle and non-bundle, which is essentially what entrepreneurial action does when one is in front of the consideration of the entrepreneurial opportunities in spaces.

The concern from Sam Altman is indeed one of a kind - even many entrepreneurs would think - since he using an extremme example of innovative work that reaches out the limits of our space as we know it. But his concern is clearly stated - how many factors in a given environment may create certain limits to what is possible, even in Silicon Valley. 

To be concerned with that may mean to be facing a dilemma that entrepreneurs may face although many of them may not even notice. That they do seek to do something, to be somebody, to change their spaces. But then they too may be trapped within certain limits, and may not even be interested in rethinking how relative is the space they live; as they can be comfortable and assume that a given reality is stable. If we were to use a simple physical metaphor, some of them may improve their space by painting the walls, some others propose new kinds of lights, and others may rethink the ways for living but yet within the space, accepting the limits and the boundaries of that space - economic, social, cultural. With that, we too may miss the possibilities of reconsidering the space as it is assumed to be. In other words, to be breaking the wall.

To shift away from the far example of rethinking life, and to consider the boundaries, consider how many entrepreneurs are busy writing applications for the Android platform, like games. For these, they might be operating under the limits of the space as they know - the limits of mobile phones available in the market, the limits - defined by the technological allowances and policies - imposed by Google Play marketplace, to name some limits. Yes, a lot can be done there but too yes to the idea that they have to, to a certain extent, accept the rules of the platform.

With these comparisons my intention is to invite us to celebrate, first, that the changes that created our environment strongly sets our perspectives and how we respond when we think about the future. When I visited my car's mechanic, a couple years ago, and asked him about the potential rise of eletric cars in Brazil, his reasons for why it wouldn't work were mostly market reasons and less to do with what could be thought of as higher values such as the environmental impact to the planet or other moral or even religious concerns. But to think that way, I caught myself when writing this, I would be missing the point that there are no lower or higher values and what really matters is that the values given are usually enough for driving our entrepreneurial action. In other words, if one justifies the reality of a market to judge if something is a go-no-go then this one is likely aware of the characterizations of that market, which could be generally considered a good thing the idea that many of us understand what are markets. 

Therefore, and if we are to consider how we are bounded to our environment, we shouldn't miss the celebration that the possibilities for doing things might be expanded given the abundance of possibilities offered by the platforms of our modern world. It is a good thing that a lot can be done and that human potential can be busy building things by using the tools and methods and frameworks and systems and networks and a lot more doing all of that with good expectations and also in harmony with others. There is that happening in the world and it is worth celebrating.

However, it comes from that too that the world of possibilities given by our environment can greatly impact many to, for lack of a better word, to be trapped or thinking in the box. In other words, there is a lot of movement that might be considered as entrepreneurial movement but in fact, if taken from perspective, can be considered to be business as usual. And there is nothing wrong with that as the bricklayer that builds houses carries the main element of the true entrepreneurs - the ability to get things done. What matters for all the entrepreneurs - not matter what they the bits and pieces that they are layering - is that being aware of their environment - tools or platforms or methods or the playbooks or a marketplace or else - is important as they should understand and interpret the obvious things - like boundaries or limits and possibilities - but also the meaning for themselves and from the perspective of where they are going such as the view for the startup growth and the business in the long run. 

Let us continue to celebrate some aspects that shapes our environment, starting first with a moment to think about the formation of platforms espeically that more digital platorms are layered in our lives; and to to consider how what we do is highly influeced by the shapes and form of the interfaces of tools we have, the things we interact with. And furthermore that our environment is also constructed by the minimal tools for collaboration, our vocabulary, the words that people use to do the things they want to do.
