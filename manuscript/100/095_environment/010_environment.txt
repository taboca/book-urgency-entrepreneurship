If entrepreneurship is so interested in serving people's needs, why is it that in its urgency to do, it builds so many and complex things that even misses the actual needs of people? This phenomenon can be heard from advisors that urge many entrepreneurs to focus on the problems of their customers, not on technology or solutions. Granted, that the advice is precious, except that in the urgency to do so we generally miss that we are learning about people's needs using existing technologies that affects our views - like special goggles - or we may miss that many of the building blocks for building things set us half-way to complete a solution. 

Thus it may be worth to consider the implications that as the entrepreneurial function can't hack into people's lives directly, and as it does so by changing the environment first, the fruits of the prior movement happens to hack our lives as builders - how we build, what we build, and why we build. The effects of such entanglement may be observable when zooming out and in, as it influences the whole entrepreneurial movement and also the subtle movements of ourselves as doers. As for the first, a moment of listening to a leading character from one of the richest innovation hubs in the world - Sam Altman of Silicon Valley, Sam Altman of YCombinator, and more recently the Sam Altman of OpenAI [^footnote_samaltman] - especially his concern about the voices, or the lack of voices, of modern Silicon Valley that to a certain extent puts at risk his high hopes for the potential for innovation: 

[^footnote_samaltman]: Sam Altman's insights into the cultural and innovative dynamics of Silicon Valley are informed by his extensive experience in the tech industry, particularly through his role as the former president of Y Combinator, one of the most successful startup accelerators globally.

'If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical' was a memorable quote I heard this year."* (Altman, 2017)

But if for a moment Sam's concern appears not practical to our day as builders, if may only be so as it takes our imagination to the far-ahead implications, which shouldn't take our attention away from the concern that the environment is seriously impacting on our implementations of the practical day, especially given that the movement can't get away from its essential entrepreneurial function of get things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]. As an example, let's consider the reflection from Brian Chesky  about how their early team weren't so excited after having noticed that someone else seemed to be working in their same idea: 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can lead to the entrepreneurial function to be obsolete.

> *"In fact, the thing we don't usually talk about is that we started exploring creating a roommate matching website. ..  Until one day, we typed 'roommates.com' and realized [that] somebody had built that site. .. And this was like three weeks or four later, and I said, 'Why the hell didn't anyone type that site in the first day? Cause I just wasted four weeks.' [laugher]."* (Chesky, Brian, 2015, 6:29)

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment Space - Consider to bring ideas from Joseph Schumpeter as Marcio is talking about the situation of abundance of solutions in a space - which it might have to do with the unrealistic exploration by Schumpeter that the entrepreneurial function is not needed if all needs are satisfied - but know too that where Marcio is going is that needs are too created, so spaces can be a trap plus the hint of leisure from Schumpeter might be a case to consider too. Nevertheless the saturated situation of Schumpeter can be realized. @meta-refid 1212-2233-3433-3933

To be fair, it can't be said what Brian's team had seen in that site to give up that direction, but the point from Brian offers an insight that many entrepreneurs will recognize - that in their path of discovery, they do find certain evidences that influences their response in so seamless ways that we generally can't see the brutality where some environmental elements gets to be translated as values, essentially anchoring ourselves. Now, and given that Brian's team didn't go ahead in that direction and end up making Airbnb.com, it had provoked me to consider how roommates.com of that day had an influence in Airbnb.

Although, and on the other hand, and after many of us having witnessed the execution and of Brian's team for a while, we can more calmly can consider that if Brian's team had worked on roommates.com, then the world of roommates would be much better much sooner;which brings us to the very point of how the environment may be treating or tricking us after all. Thus, where we are going essentially celebrates how the environment talks with us, that platforms, tools, methods, you name it, has the power of influence as all of these things are in fact materializations of existing values. We may celebrate another conclusive point from Sam from that same post: 

> *"Political correctness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims. The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage."* Sam Altman,  https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

Thus if a dilemma sets in for some entrepreneurs might be less of a concern; while more should be given to the inclination and the urge to do something that has no time for any dilemma. And if the concern from Sam Altman is seen as one of a kind - if we worry about the higher expectations of the highest kind of entrepreneur movement that can be prevented by values - we would be essentially missing the nuanced observation that can help all entrepreneurs in all situations, which starts with the celebration that the forces of our environment are quite strong, and are the ones motivating us to act and influencing our perspectives. 

Furthermore, that a celebration for how entangled our environment is, can give us an opportunity to reflect and see that the boundaries for us are limited by a set of values we anchor ourselves to, values which are getting richer or that too are giving us well-informed reasons or our actions but nevertheless have an influence on our perspectives for then how we respond as for what we want to do and build as builders. 

As an example of how values shift, consider a visit I did to my car's mechanic, a couple years ago when I had asked him about the potential rise of eletric cars in Brazil, whereas his reasons for why it wouldn't work were were quite informed market-oriented reasons and less to do with what could be thought of as higher values such as the environmental impact to the planet or other moral or even religious concerns. In other words, if one justifies the reality of a market to judge if something is a go-no-go then this one is likely aware of the characterizations of that market, which could be generally considered a good thing the idea that many of us understand what are markets. But as much as that idea means to be celebrating the well-informed citizen, likely supported by the wide adoption of means to access information, it also shows how the realities that we have created, such as the market realities of our environments, become new factors on our ways to set the limits for what we do. 

In other words, many of us can be satisfied by "thinking outside the box" that can be a mere exploration or a tinkering within another wider box that is not at all being challenged; which is other words is to say that a provocation to a system of values which may sound quite provoking might be about doing business as usual within another and unseen envinronmental box of values. 
Therefore, and if we are to consider how we are bounded to our environment, we shouldn't miss the celebration that the possibilities for doing things might be expanded given the abundance of possibilities offered by the platforms of our modern world; but too that such expansion is also an expansion that can take our attention.

It is a good thing that a lot can be done and that human potential can be busy building things by using the tools and methods and frameworks and systems and networks and a lot more doing all of that with good expectations and also in harmony with others. There is that happening in the world and it is worth celebrating. And there is nothing wrong with that as the bricklayer that builds houses carries the main element of the true entrepreneurs - the ability to get things done. 

What matters for all the entrepreneurs - not matter what they the bits and pieces that they are layering - is that being aware of their environment - tools or platforms or methods or the playbooks or a marketplace or else - is important as they should understand and interpret the obvious things - like boundaries or limits and possibilities - but also the meaning for themselves and from the perspective of where they are going such as the view for the startup growth and the business in the long run. 

Let us continue to celebrate some aspects that shapes our environment, starting first with a moment to think about the formation of platforms espeically that more digital platorms are layered in our lives; and to to consider how what we do is highly influeced by the shapes and form of the interfaces of tools we have, the things we interact with. And furthermore that our environment is also constructed by the minimal tools for collaboration, our vocabulary, the words that people use to do the things they want to do.
