If entrepreneurship is so interested in serving people's needs, why is it that in its urgency to do, it builds so many and complex things that even misses the actual needs of people? This phenomenon can be heard from advisors that urge many entrepreneurs to focus on the problems of their customers, not on technology or solutions. Granted, that the advice is precious, except that in the urgency to do so we generally miss that we are learning about people's needs using existing technologies that affects our views - like special goggles - or we may miss that many of the building blocks for building things set us half-way to complete a solution. 

Thus it may be worth to consider the implications that as the entrepreneurial function can't hack into people's lives directly, and as it does so by changing the environment first, the fruits of the prior movement happens to hack our lives as builders - how we build, what we build, and why we build. The effects of this entanglement may be observable as we zoom out or in, as it influences the whole entrepreneurial movement and also the subtle movements of ourselves as doers. 

As for the first, a moment of listening to a leading character from one of the richest innovation hubs in the world - Sam Altman of Silicon Valley, Sam Altman of YCombinator, and more recently the Sam Altman of OpenAI [^footnote_samaltman] - especially his concern about the voices, or the lack of voices, of modern Silicon Valley that to a certain extent puts at risk his high hopes for the potential for innovation: 

[^footnote_samaltman]: Sam Altman's insights into the cultural and innovative dynamics of Silicon Valley are informed by his extensive experience in the tech industry, particularly through his role as the former president of Y Combinator, one of the most successful startup accelerators globally.

'If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical' was a memorable quote I heard this year."* (Altman, 2017)

* Outline - Complication - The environment of entrepreneurship is the opportunity and can be the trap.  [feat. Sam Altman]

If we celebrate the concerns of Sam Altman, it may give us a moment to reflect on how the entrepreneurial environment shapes the entrepreneurial function, not anymore by any fierciful or fearsome hands, but by the denial of the investment that may be necessary, as investors can pick which kind of innovation they want to invest, therefore by the stronger and invisible hands that can boost entrepreneurs or scale them up. 

Furthermore, the effects of these influences from this backstage brings us to zoom in and consider that the getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone] of the everyday is a reflection of values not only of values outspoken but because a direction is given by the currents, by the available platforms, by available tools, methods, and more; as if the building blocks were telling us what to do. 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can lead to the entrepreneurial function to be obsolete.

As an illustration, let us go back to the very early days of Airbnb and when the idea were too fragile and almost didn't happen, luckily because the founders had stumbled in what for them seemed to be a great stone on their way: 

> *"In fact, ... we started exploring creating a roommate matching website. ... Until one day, we typed 'roommates.com' [into the browser] and realized somebody had already built that site. ... And this was like three weeks or four later, and I said, 'Why the hell didn't anyone type that site in the first day? Because I just wasted four weeks.' [Laughter]."* (Chesky, Brian, 2015, 6:29)

@todo @meta
* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment Space - Consider to bring ideas from Joseph Schumpeter as Marcio is talking about the situation of abundance of solutions in a space - which it might have to do with the unrealistic exploration by Schumpeter that the entrepreneurial function is not needed if all needs are satisfied - but know too that where Marcio is going is that needs are too created, so spaces can be a trap plus the hint of leisure from Schumpeter might be a case to consider too. Nevertheless the saturated situation of Schumpeter can be realized. @meta-refid 1212-2233-3433-3933
* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment - Add a footnote about Schumpeter and the notion that the entrepreneur is essentially one that executes an entrepreneurial function of getting things done. @meta-refid 1212-2233-4433-9494

And if the passage doesn't ring any bell, especially if you aren't a site builder, consider an analogous situation of what a writer feels after she started her material and suddenly finds out that someone else published a book with the same title for the same audience and apparently with the same theme. And if that has a degree of truth, successful entrepreneurs know too that execution matters more in the long run, which is the case as given that Brian's team kept focusing on AirBedAndBreakfast.com, which later became known as Airbnb.com, which later gave them strenght to beat the fierciful attacks of a major competitor [^footnote_airbnb_competition], which brought them to finally make more than 4 million hosts [^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts] and their guests happy. In other words, their hosts and guests would be also happy to know that they gave up working on "roommates.com" as the site was being worked on back in the days.   

[^footnote_airbnb_competition]: According to Brian's interview in *Brian Chesky on Launching Airbnb and the Challenges of Scale* (2015), the Samwer brothers emerged targeting Airbnb by exercising their proven ability to clone successful business models and rapidly scaling them, often outpacing some of the original innovators. Although they posed a significant challenge, Airbnb's unique value proposition and strong community engagement enabled them to thrive against such competition.

^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts]: Since its inception in 2007, Airbnb has experienced phenomenal growth, evolving from a small startup where two hosts welcomed three guests to their home in San Francisco to a global platform with over 5 million hosts, according to "About Us," retrieved from https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/.

And althought these early movements can be respected as a sort of partial competitive analysis research work, I ask us to observe that of our propensity to value material findings of a specific domain, as these are interpreted as signs of the execution by steps that others in similar positions in the same domain. In other words, the building blocks do tell us what to do as well, and that can be quite strong to impact what we do, being to change our course or to join a course.

To be clear about our exploration, where we're going isn't too different from some considerations of the previous chapter, when we had considered how entrepreneurs might identify themselves with others like entrepreneurs, investors or their audiences. Likewise, these doers too trust too strongly the richness that is available from prior entrepreneurial movements that built which forms a dynamic space, which pulls action by the existence of platforms, by methods, by tools. Or, in other words, a space that acts like a framework or a playbook, that to a certain extent reveals that we essentially use domain-specific goggles, and especially in the modern and richer networked situation, it becomes even more evident the intensity of usage of platforms and tools and methods, and by that, it pulls the entrepreneur to respond as if the system prompts them to provide the answer.

To follow up, let us first look at the rise of some technological platforms which revals how the entreprenurial function is entangled with different spaces, and how it pulls them to the act of getting things done, which happens to provoke other spaces by its own capacity to prompt entrepreneurs for movement - a reflection that explores that the building blocks carry encoded messages of platforms, of a culture, or an economic system. Next, and developing a further exploration of other nuances from our environment, let us consider how interfaces, like the shape of tools and services, have an impact on us. And furthermore that our environment is also constructed by the minimal tools for collaboration, our vocabulary, the words that people use to do the things they want to do.
