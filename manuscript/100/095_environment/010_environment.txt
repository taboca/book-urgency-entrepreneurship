If entrepreneurship is so interested in serving people's needs, why is it that in its urgency to do, it builds complex things to a point that it misses the actual needs of people? This phenomenon is recognized when advisors remind entrepreneurs to focus on the problems of customers [^footnote_focus_problems] and not on the solutions. Granted that the advice is precious; so much that if taken further it may too remind our advisors that the means for listening to people can be well-influenced by existing solutions.

It might be worth to pause and ask ourselves if our methods for comprehension could be used as methods of control [^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]. Or, in other words, if our environment exercises a form of control by its means for building and distribution i.e. of telling us what to do, how to do, and why to do; especially when we are empowered to urgently advance by taking advantage of its richness.

[^footnote_focus_problems]: As an example we shall consider the emergence of the book from Uri Levine, the co-founder of the popular the navigation and transit application entitled Waze, entitled *Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs* (2023); as a well-thought response to help entrepreneurs deal with the phenomenon where the rush towards solution-centric approaches potentially places genuine innovation at risk.

[^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]: The consideration to think of technologies influencing our movements, like to control the process to a certain extent is motivated by *The Technological Revolution: Notes on the Relationship of Technology, Science, and Culture* from Peter Drucker and his notes such as "But 'knowledge' changed its meaning from being 'understanding', i.e., focused on man's mind, to being 'control', i.e., focused on application in and through technology." It should be noted Peter's awareness that "It would be claiming too much to say that technology established itself as the paramount power over science." But to his consideration that "it is technology that gives the union of the two its character; it is a coupling of science to technology, rather than a coupling of science and technology" (Drucker, P. (2011). p. 152. Routledge. Original work published 1970).

Where we are going in this chapter may relate with the perspective in our prior chapter where we had considered that entrepreneurs identify themselves with groups and the opportunity/risk of them to be set in a movement. In a similar way, we will look at the environment - such as by its methods or platforms or tools or even the voices - that is rich enough to sets them in a trajectory of movement. The motivation to overvaluing the impact of the environment comes from the very fact that the entrepreneurial function doesn't hack people's lives directly but it does so indirectly through spaces; which goes along, as entrepreneurs are people too, that the prior successful entrepreneurial movement influences how we build, what we build, and why we build.

The effects of this entanglement may be observable as we zoom out or in, as it influences the whole entrepreneurial movement and also the subtle movements of ourselves as doers. As for the first, a moment of listening to a leading character from one of the richest innovation hubs in the world - Sam Altman of Silicon Valley, Sam Altman of YCombinator, and more recently the Sam Altman of OpenAI [^footnote_samaltman] - especially his concern about the voices, or the lack of voices, of modern Silicon Valley that to a certain extent puts at risk his high hopes for the potential for innovation: 

[^footnote_samaltman]: Sam Altman's insights into the cultural and innovative dynamics of Silicon Valley are informed by his extensive experience in the tech industry, particularly through his role as the former president of Y Combinator, one of the most successful startup accelerators globally.

'If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical' was a memorable quote I heard this year."* (Altman, 2017)

But if you celebrate the concerns of some Altman, it may give us a moment to reflect about how the entrepreneurial function is shaped by the entrepreneurial environment. In this case, not by any forceful hands, but by the denial of the investment that is necessary, by the supporting role, for instance of investors - and their invisible hands - that chooses to aid the ideas that they want, to boost or to scale following their preferences which certainly impacts major buildings like the availability of tools for other builders, like platforms. 

Which brings us to wonder about the practical effects of the environment as we exercise the daily function of getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]; which we generally recognize and accept as good news as otherwise getting things done isn't possible, our wondering shall transcend the basic needs  of doing and is concerned with the situation of us to be directed by these means, such as directed by the means of specific domains. As an illustration we may look at the early days of Airbnb, when they were "AirBedAndBreakfast.com," and consider how characterizations of their domain impacted them to dream or to give up, as the interview given to Reid Hoffman suggests: 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can create the conditions for an entrepreneurial function that is obsolete; which may be observable in part if we consider that many people think they are entrepreneurs while they might be building something too simple from the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction or to be considered as business as usual.

> *"In fact, ... we started exploring creating a roommate matching website. ... Until one day, we typed 'roommates.com' [into the browser] and realized somebody had already built that site. ... And this was like three weeks or four later, and I said, 'Why the hell didn't anyone type that site in the first day? Because I just wasted four weeks.' [Laughter]."* (Chesky, Brian, 2015, 6:29)

It may be so that the above passage doesn't ring any bell, especially if you haven't created websites for a while. To explain with an analogy, consider a writer that started to work on her book and suddenly discovers that another book is already published with the same title, same audience, and apparently the same theme; and her focus is taken away.

While these situations may accomodate an honorable consideration that they care, such as that they could be exercising a preliminary form of a market research, we shouldn't miss the opportunity to catch and augument the movement that smoothly invades the entrepreneurial movement as it adds an extra value the discovery by the intrinsic value of the source. 







To be fair with our doers, they do recognize their instinctive movements by engaging in learning. Brian's team, as history shows, had grasped quite profoundly that execution in the long run matters more, which can be recounted as they kept focusing on that other "AirBedAndBreakfast.com" idea, which later became "Airbnb.com," which gave them strenght to survive and beat a fierciful attack of a major competitor [^footnote_airbnb_competition], which brought them to make more than 4 million hosts [^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts] and their guests happy. 

[^footnote_airbnb_competition]: According to Brian's interview in *Brian Chesky on Launching Airbnb and the Challenges of Scale* (2015), the Samwer brothers emerged targeting Airbnb by exercising their proven ability to clone successful business models and rapidly scaling them, often outpacing some of the original innovators. Although they posed a significant challenge, Airbnb's unique value proposition and strong community engagement enabled them to thrive against such competition.

[^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts]: Since its inception in 2007, Airbnb has experienced phenomenal growth, evolving from a small startup where two hosts welcomed three guests to their home in San Francisco to a global platform with over 5 million hosts, according to "About Us," retrieved from https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/.

* Outline - Answer - By celebrating the formation of things around, like platforms, technologies, interfaces, and the language, we can reflect on the relativeness that entrepreneurial function becomes obsolete in a way but yet thriving it another way. [Feat. Schumpeter]
--> 





Yet, given that Airbnb's hosts and guests would be also happy to know that they gave up working on "roommates.com" as the site was "taken" back in early the days, can be yet another motivation for us to consider how many of our movements - especially in the early days when things are small and we might act like benevolent dictators of our own teams - are just half-way directed by things from the environment that seems to act like a playbook, that to a certain extent reveals that we essentially navigate our space by using our domain-specific goggles.

To follow up, we will start by exploring how our world changed as we shifted from an entrepreneurial function building from the nature and set ourselves to build from a second nature, where our creations essentially brought to us the building blocks. Then we will shift our attention to the rise of interfaces, what were once the shape of a tool or the form of a car seat but became the space of interaction given by the layout and interaction experience of digital systems; again a space influencing us to build and to be driven. And finally, we end the chapter with a reflection about the words around us, the very elements and how the environment shapes the arrangement of them to impact our actions. These moments will be an opportunity to reflect that technological platforms are powerful indeed to set us to be creative; and along with that that there is price to pay when we are to immersed in it.
