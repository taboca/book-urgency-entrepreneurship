If entrepreneurship is so interested in serving people's needs, why is it that in its urgency to do, it builds complex things to a point that it misses the actual needs of people? This phenomenon is recognized when advisors remind entrepreneurs to focus on the problems of customers [^footnote_focus_problems] and not on the solutions. Granted that the advice is precious; so much that if taken further it may too remind our advisors that the means for listening to people can be well-influenced by existing solutions.

It might be worth to pause and ask ourselves if our methods for comprehension could be used as methods of control [^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]. Or, in other words, if our environment exercises a form of control by its means for building and distribution i.e. of telling us what to do, how to do, and why to do; especially when we are empowered to urgently advance by taking advantage of its richness.

[^footnote_focus_problems]: As an example we shall consider the emergence of the book from Uri Levine, the co-founder of the popular the navigation and transit application entitled Waze, entitled *Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs* (2023); as a well-thought response to help entrepreneurs deal with the phenomenon where the rush towards solution-centric approaches potentially places genuine innovation at risk.

[^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]: The consideration to think of technologies influencing our movements, like to control the process to a certain extent is motivated by *The Technological Revolution: Notes on the Relationship of Technology, Science, and Culture* from Peter Drucker and his notes such as "But 'knowledge' changed its meaning from being 'understanding', i.e., focused on man's mind, to being 'control', i.e., focused on application in and through technology." It should be noted Peter's awareness that "It would be claiming too much to say that technology established itself as the paramount power over science." But to his consideration that "it is technology that gives the union of the two its character; it is a coupling of science to technology, rather than a coupling of science and technology" (Drucker, P. (2011). p. 152. Routledge. Original work published 1970).

Where we are going in this chapter may relate with the perspective in our prior chapter where we had considered that entrepreneurs identify themselves with groups and the opportunity/risk of them to be set in a movement. In a similar way, we will look at the environment - such as by its methods or platforms or tools or even the voices - that is rich enough to sets them in a trajectory of movement. The motivation to overvaluing the impact of the environment comes from the very fact that the entrepreneurial function doesn't hack people's lives directly but it does so indirectly through spaces; which goes along, as entrepreneurs are people too, that the prior successful entrepreneurial movement influences how we build, what we build, and why we build.

The effects of this entanglement may be observable as we zoom out or in, as it influences the whole entrepreneurial movement and also the subtle movements of ourselves as doers. As for the first, a moment of listening to a leading character from one of the richest innovation hubs in the world - Sam Altman of Silicon Valley, Sam Altman of YCombinator, and more recently the Sam Altman of OpenAI [^footnote_samaltman] - especially his concern about the voices, or the lack of voices, of modern Silicon Valley that to a certain extent puts at risk his high hopes for the potential for innovation: 

[^footnote_samaltman]: Sam Altman's insights into the cultural and innovative dynamics of Silicon Valley are informed by his extensive experience in the tech industry, particularly through his role as the former president of Y Combinator, one of the most successful startup accelerators globally.

But if you celebrate the concerns of some Altman, it may give us a moment to reflect about how the entrepreneurial function is shaped by the entrepreneurial environment. In this case, not by any forceful hands, but by the denial of the investment that is necessary, by the supporting role, for instance of investors - and their invisible hands - that chooses to aid the ideas that they want, to boost or to scale following their preferences which certainly impacts major buildings like the availability of tools for other builders, like platforms. 

Which brings us to wonder about the practical effects of the environment as we exercise the daily function of getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]; which we generally recognize and accept as good news as otherwise getting things done isn't possible, our wondering shall transcend the basic needs  of doing and is concerned with the situation of us to be directed by these means, such as directed by the means of specific domains. As an illustration we may look at the early days of Airbnb, when they were "AirBedAndBreakfast.com," and consider how characterizations of their domain impacted them to dream or to give up, as the interview given to Reid Hoffman suggests: 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can create the conditions for an entrepreneurial function that is obsolete; which may be observable in part if we consider that many people think they are entrepreneurs while they might be building something too simple from the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction or to be considered as business as usual.

And this was like three weeks or four later, and I said, 'Why the hell didn't anyone type that site in the first day? Because I just wasted four weeks.' [Laughter]."* (Chesky, Brian, 2015, 6:29)

It may be so that the above passage doesn't ring any bell, especially if you haven't created websites for a while. To explain with an analogy, consider a writer that started to work on her book and suddenly discovers that another book is already published with the same title, same audience, and apparently the same theme; and her focus is taken away.

And if we pause their movement to ask them what they're doing, they may justify in terms of normal routines as in some sort of preliminary market research which could even cause the impression that they care a lot about what they do if not for cause an impression for them that the asking of such (silly) question could be the actual stone on their way. And to be fair with them, and logically, they are the ones in the arena, the ones that seek advices and double check things and such as part of their craft. In other words, that they are not so reactive by instincts and do get involved with the understanding that execution matters more in the long run. As an aside, and to celebrate that the execution matters more in the long run, Brian's team, as history shows, had grasped quite profoundly that idea, which can be recounted as they kept focusing on the other prior idea, "AirBedAndBreakfast.com," which later became "Airbnb.com," which gave them the resources and strength and directness to survive and beat the fierciful attack of a major competitor [^footnote_airbnb_competition], which brought them to make more than 4 million hosts [^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts] happy. In other words, it would be unfair to say that the existence of "roomates.com" had a stake in defining the future of airbnb.

[^footnote_airbnb_competition]: According to Brian's interview in *Brian Chesky on Launching Airbnb and the Challenges of Scale* (2015), the Samwer brothers emerged targeting Airbnb by exercising their proven ability to clone successful business models and rapidly scaling them, often outpacing some of the original innovators. Although they posed a significant challenge, Airbnb's unique value proposition and strong community engagement enabled them to thrive against such competition.

[^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts]: Since its inception in 2007, Airbnb has experienced phenomenal growth, evolving from a small startup where two hosts welcomed three guests to their home in San Francisco to a global platform with over 5 million hosts, according to "About Us," retrieved from https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/.

But that doesn't isolate them from the fact that their attention were taken to a certain extent; as in that they essentially gave an extra value for what they have identitied as evidence, likely because that finding represents something - sometimes big - in that domain. As an example, the noise effects can be produced as the founder-CEO amplifies the effect with the team, such as by voicing first within the group [^footnote_kahneman_noise_group] which may even be applauded as that finding is also valued (quickly) likely because the team might be using the same goggles, thus affecting the speed of their decisions before they know it. This possibility may well exist in the setting of entrepreneurship due to its efficiency - speed in the end of the day - as judgment may be much faster, and mechanic to a certain extent, in contrast with thinking through as suggested by the given distinction from judgement and thinking in *Noise* by Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein (2021): 

> *"Judgement should not be confused with 'thinking.' It is a much narrower concept: judgement is a form of measurement in which the instrument is a human mind. Like other measurements, a judgement assigns a score to an object. "* (p. XX)

[^footnote_kahneman_noise_group]: In their discussion in Chapter 8 of *Noise*, Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein examine the influence of group dynamics on judgment and decision-making. They highlight how groups can add complexity to these processes, noting that even seemingly irrelevant factors—like the order in which team members speak—can steer decisions in arbitrary directions.

And given the situation that an early team may operate essentially as benevolent dictators [^footnote_michaeldearing_benevolent_dictators] of their own movement, and that their horizon brings the voice of *Their* market that may well speak to them [^footnote_michaeldearing_marketspeaks], and that they are essentially measuring what they see and what they get, we can ask ourselves if they are halfway directed by any set of elements that characterizes their environment - such as tools or methods or platforms and more - or halfway driven by the lights of an horizon as seen through goggles; thus setting them as actors that may well follow an invisible playbook spoken by the whole environment.

If we argument this movement that invades the entrepreneurial movement, as in to claim the noise in what is not seen as noise, is an opportunity to celebrate that awareness for how environment matters, for good and bad. Thus, following up, we will start by exploring how our world changed as we shifted from an entrepreneurial function that used to build mainly from a nature as we knew it - as in the nature made of the 5 elements such as water, fire, earth, wind, and love - to become builders in a new world, or a second nature, on top of platforms, using building blocks from other space, the space that entrepreneurs made.
