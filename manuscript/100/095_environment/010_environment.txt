If entrepreneurship is so interested in serving people's needs, why is it that in its urgency to do, it builds complex things to a point that it misses the needs of people? This complication is recognized by advisors that recognize the phenomenon where entrepreneurs need to focus on the problems of customers, not on solutions [^footnote_focus_problems]. Granted, the advice is precious, but if so can and should also remind our own advisors that the even means for listening to people can be well-influenced by existing solutions.

Another motivation to value the impact of the environment comes from the very fact that the entrepreneurial function doesn't hack directly people's lives; that it does so indirectly through things created, through solutions, in our spaces. In other words, and given that entrepreneurs are people too, any prior and successful entrepreneurial movement set us in directions in terms of how we build, what we build, and why we build. 

[^footnote_focus_problems]: As an example we shall consider the emergence of the book from Uri Levine, the co-founder of the popular the navigation and transit application entitled Waze, entitled *Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs* (2023); as a well-thought response to help entrepreneurs deal with the phenomenon where the rush towards solution-centric approaches potentially places genuine innovation at risk.

Not different from our prior chapter, where we had considered the movement that entrepreneurs do as they identify themselves with groups, similarly, we shall now consider the movement that happens by the  environment of entrepreneurship - defined by its methods, platforms, tools and more - an environment is now rich enough to influence our trajectory, especially when they are in a hurry.

The effects of this entanglement may be observable as we zoom out or in, as it influences the whole entrepreneurial movement and also the subtle movements of ourselves as doers. As for the first, a moment of listening to a leading character from one of the most active innovation hubs - Sam Altman of YCombinator from Silicon Valley [^footnote_samaltman] - is an opportunity to consider about how the voices, or the lack of voices, of modern Silicon Valley puts at risk the intrinsic movment of innovation: 

[^footnote_samaltman]: Sam Altman's insights into the cultural and innovative dynamics of Silicon Valley are informed by his extensive experience in the tech industry, particularly through his role as the former president of Y Combinator, one of the most successful startup accelerators globally.

* Outline - Complication - The environment of entrepreneurship is the opportunity and can be the trap.  [feat. Sam Altman] 
--> 

What's inescapable from the viewpoint of Sam Altman - where we should recognize too his role as the CEO of OpenAI - is the reflection about how the entrepreneurial environment is influenced by the hands of investors which act given by their values, thus what they choose, to boost and scale, impacts the availability of tools, especially in a world where tools are delivered and distributed as technological platforms.

Which brings us to wonder about the practical effects of the environment as we exercise the daily function of getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]; which we generally recognize and accept as good news as otherwise getting things done isn't possible, our wondering shall transcend the basic needs  of doing and is concerned with the situation of us to be directed by these means, such as directed by the means of specific domains. As an illustration we may look at the early days of Airbnb, when they were "AirBedAndBreakfast.com," and consider how characterizations of their domain impacted them to dream or to give up, as the interview given to Reid Hoffman suggests: 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can create the conditions for an entrepreneurial function that is obsolete; which may be observable in part if we consider that many people think they are entrepreneurs while they might be building something too simple from the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction or to be considered as business as usual.

> *"In fact, ... we started exploring creating a roommate matching website. ... Until one day, we typed 'roommates.com' [into the browser] and realized somebody had already built that site. ... And this was like three weeks or four later, and I said, 'Why the hell didn't anyone type that site in the first day? Because I just wasted four weeks.' [Laughter]."* (Chesky, Brian, 2015, 6:29)

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment Space - Consider to bring ideas from Joseph Schumpeter as Marcio is talking about the situation of abundance of solutions in a space - which it might have to do with the unrealistic exploration by Schumpeter that the entrepreneurial function is not needed if all needs are satisfied - but know too that where Marcio is going is that needs are too created, so spaces can be a trap plus the hint of leisure from Schumpeter might be a case to consider too.

--> 

The passage may not ring a bell, if you haven't created websites. But the fact that a potential writer in the early stage - when browsing the shelves of a digital bookstore - hears quite loudly "the bells of the competition," suggests how much the concrete tools they use given by their domain prevents them from listening through, as if they are trapped by the routines within the walls of a cathedral that gives them purpose. Furthermore, if we join that room as an average citizen and optimistic witness, a normal routine is seen where we may even be glad of their skills - a hint about their interest in market research - if not making us a witness of how much they care for what they do. However, on the other hand, if an outsider-inspector sees everyone in the room under the suspicions that a serious crime has happened - the kidnapping of their attention - he may well be dismissed as a dumb inspector just asking silly questions and even to be considered a source of distraction. 

But to be fair, logically, they are the ones in the arena, the ones that seek advices, that double check things as they go - these are things they do as part of their craft. These are factors telling us that they are not so reactive by instincts and do get involved with the understanding that execution matters more in the long run. 

As an aside, and to celebrate that the execution matters more in the long run, Brian's team, as history shows, had grasped quite profoundly that idea which can be recounted as they kept focusing on the other prior idea, "AirBedAndBreakfast.com," which later became "Airbnb.com," which gave them the resources and strength to survive and beat a fierciful attack of a major competitor [^footnote_airbnb_competition], which brought them to make more than four million hosts [^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts] and their guests happier. In other words, it would be unfair to say that the existence of "roomates.com" had a stake in defining the future of Airbnb.

[^footnote_airbnb_competition]: According to Brian's interview in *Brian Chesky on Launching Airbnb and the Challenges of Scale* (2015), the Samwer brothers emerged targeting Airbnb by exercising their proven ability to clone successful business models and rapidly scaling them, often outpacing some of the original innovators. Although they posed a significant challenge, Airbnb's unique value proposition and strong community engagement enabled them to thrive against such competition.

[^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts]: Since its inception in 2007, Airbnb has experienced phenomenal growth, evolving from a small startup where two hosts welcomed three guests to their home in San Francisco to a global platform with over 5 million hosts, according to "About Us," retrieved from https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/.

But that doesn't isolate them from the fact that their attention were taken away to a certain extent; and a concern as for why they gave an extra value for some of the things they see and get on their way. The given that a finding represents something - as in sometimes big positively or negatively - plus the slightest possibility that a founder-CEO voices a judgement within the group [^footnote_kahneman_noise_group] may well activate the group not to go ahead - and comply with the founder judgement because they are subordinates - but to be thankful that the founder-CEO brough to them a measuring system for judging fast. 

Moreover, if the team applauds the founder's voice, likely not doing a fanfare (which could signal their mistake) but by the powerful strenght of reactions, like likes or thumbs up through digital messaging systems, it may set us to consider how the richness of our the environment acts to support our judgements, or how it sets a mechanized environment of getting things done to a certain extent, in contrast with the necessity of thinking through. A support to that line of inquiry may be given by the distinction between judgement and thinking given by *Noise* by Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein (2021):

> *"Judgement should not be confused with 'thinking.' It is a much narrower concept: judgement is a form of measurement in which the instrument is a human mind. Like other measurements, a judgement assigns a score to an object. "* (p. XX)

[^footnote_kahneman_noise_group]: In their discussion in Chapter 8 of *Noise*, Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein examine the influence of group dynamics on judgment and decision-making. They highlight how groups can add complexity to these processes, noting that even seemingly irrelevant factors—like the order in which team members speak—can steer decisions in arbitrary directions.

And given the situation that an early team may operate essentially as benevolent dictators [^footnote_michaeldearing_benevolent_dictators] of their own movement, and that their horizon brings the voice of *Their* market that may well speak to them [^footnote_michaeldearing_marketspeaks], and that they are essentially trying to comprehend but actually measuring what they see and what they get with the means from their domain, we can then ask ourselves - are they are halfway directed by any set of elements that characterizes their environment? Are they halfway directed by the tools or methods or platforms? And more, halfway driven by the lights of an horizon given by the goggles they use, the very goggles that gives them hopes? Would they be to a certain extent following a sort of invisible playbook spoken by the whole environment?

* Outline - Answer - By celebrating the formation of things around, like platforms, technologies, interfaces, and the language, we can reflect on the relativeness that entrepreneurial becomes powerful and powerfully obsolete alltogether. [Feat. Schumpeter]

If we augment the possibility that a movement invades the entrepreneurial movement, such as to recognize the possibility of noise in what is not generally heard as noise, we shall raise the necessity for being conscious about the influence that the things created have on us; especially now that we live in a world that has changed - from an entrepreneurial function building things from a world of natural things, as in the made of the water, fire, earth, wind, and love, to building things from world, or a second nature, where our building blocks were given by the prior movement while love continues to act on it if not taking us to act in a hurry. 

But if the these building blocks are not enough to set to us a trap - given that we have choice - when we shall too consider the possibility that the things created - technology - which had the potential of serving to us as methods for comprehension (about the world and what is possible) could be used as methods of control [^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]. Or, in other words, could it be that the the more technological concretes in our spaces could prevent us to see a horizon by the very fact that the goggles to see the world are given by technologies we had produced? 

[^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]: The consideration to think of technologies influencing our movements, like to control the process to a certain extent is motivated by *The Technological Revolution: Notes on the Relationship of Technology, Science, and Culture* from Peter Drucker and his notes such as "But 'knowledge' changed its meaning from being 'understanding', i.e., focused on man's mind, to being 'control', i.e., focused on application in and through technology." It should be noted Peter's awareness that "It would be claiming too much to say that technology established itself as the paramount power over science." But to his consideration that "it is technology that gives the union of the two its character; it is a coupling of science to technology, rather than a coupling of science and technology" (Drucker, P. (2011). p. 152. Routledge. Original work published 1970).

In other words, again, if things could be telling us what to do, how to do, and why to do; especially when we are empowered to urgently advance by taking advantage of its richness, we shall take ourselves to celebrate how our spaces are being formed by our movement and the challenges of entrepreneus that are in a position of using things from the space while at the same time willing to change their space.
