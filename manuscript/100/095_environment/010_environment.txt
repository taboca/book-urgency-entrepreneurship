If entrepreneurship is so interested in serving people's needs, why is it that in its urgency to do, it builds complex things to a point that it misses the actual needs of people? This phenomenon is recognized when advisors remind entrepreneurs to focus on the problems of customers [^footnote_focus_problems] and not on the solutions. Granted that the advice is precious; so much that if taken further it may too remind our advisors that the means for listening to people can be well-influenced by existing solutions. In other words, it might be a concern that our methods for comprehension may well be used as methods of control [^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control], especially as we urgently advance using the given building blocks set by the rich entrepreneurial environment. 

[^footnote_focus_problems]: As an example, consider the emergence of Uri Levine's *Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs* (2023) as a well-thought response to help entrepreneurs deal with the phenomenon where the rush towards solution-centric approaches potentially places genuine innovation at risk.

[^footnote_peterdrucker_comprehension_control]: The consideration to think of technologies influencing our movements, like to control the process to a certain extent is motivated by *The Technological Revolution: Notes on the Relationship of Technology, Science, and Culture* from Peter Drucker and his notes such as "But 'knowledge' changed its meaning from being 'understanding', i.e., focused on man's mind, to being 'control', i.e., focused on application in and through technology." It should be noted Peter's awareness that "It would be claiming too much to say that technology established itself as the paramount power over science." But to his consideration that "it is technology that gives the union of the two its character; it is a coupling of science to technology, rather than a coupling of science and technology" (Drucker, P. (2011). p. 152. Routledge. Original work published 1970).

Where we are going in this chapter may relate with the perspective in our prior chapter where we had considered that entrepreneurs identify themselves with groups and the opportunity/risk of them to be set in a movement. In a similar way, we will look at the environment - such as by its methods or platforms or tools or even the voices - that is rich enough to sets them in a trajectory of movement. The motivation to overvaluing the impact of the environment comes from the very fact that the entrepreneurial function doesn't hack people's lives directly but it does so indirectly through spaces; which goes along, as entrepreneurs are people too, that the prior successful entrepreneurial movement influences how we build, what we build, and why we build.

The effects of this entanglement may be observable as we zoom out or in, as it influences the whole entrepreneurial movement and also the subtle movements of ourselves as doers. As for the first, a moment of listening to a leading character from one of the richest innovation hubs in the world - Sam Altman of Silicon Valley, Sam Altman of YCombinator, and more recently the Sam Altman of OpenAI [^footnote_samaltman] - especially his concern about the voices, or the lack of voices, of modern Silicon Valley that to a certain extent puts at risk his high hopes for the potential for innovation: 

[^footnote_samaltman]: Sam Altman's insights into the cultural and innovative dynamics of Silicon Valley are informed by his extensive experience in the tech industry, particularly through his role as the former president of Y Combinator, one of the most successful startup accelerators globally.

If we celebrate the concerns of Sam Altman, it may give us a moment to reflect on how the entrepreneurial environment shapes the entrepreneurial function, not by any fierciful hands but by the denial of an investment that may be necessary; by the investor's invisible hands that chooses which of them are to be boosted and scale them up. 

Furthermore, the effects of these influences from this backstage brings us to zoom in and consider that the getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone] of the everyday is a reflection of values not only of values outspoken but because a direction is given by the currents, by the available platforms, by available tools, methods, and more; as if the building blocks were telling us what to do. 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned Austrian-American economist and political scientist known and author of "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," identifies a key characterization of the entrepreneurial function as "getting things done" (p. 132), as more important than the ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive; an observation that allow us to consider that the entrepreneurial function, given a world of too many possibilities such as of the cheaper ability to build things, can lead to the entrepreneurial function to be obsolete.

As an illustration, let us go back to the very early days of Airbnb and when the idea were too fragile and almost didn't happen, luckily because the founders had stumbled in what for them seemed to be a great stone on their way: 

> *"In fact, ... we started exploring creating a roommate matching website. ... Until one day, we typed 'roommates.com' [into the browser] and realized somebody had already built that site. ... And this was like three weeks or four later, and I said, 'Why the hell didn't anyone type that site in the first day? Because I just wasted four weeks.' [Laughter]."* (Chesky, Brian, 2015, 6:29)

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment Space - Consider to bring ideas from Joseph Schumpeter as Marcio is talking about the situation of abundance of solutions in a space - which it might have to do with the unrealistic exploration by Schumpeter that the entrepreneurial function is not needed if all needs are satisfied - but know too that where Marcio is going is that needs are too created, so spaces can be a trap plus the hint of leisure from Schumpeter might be a case to consider too. Nevertheless the saturated situation of Schumpeter can be realized. @meta-refid 1212-2233-3433-3933

And if the passage doesn't ring any bell, especially if you aren't a site builder, consider an analogous situation of what a writer feels after she started her material and suddenly finds out that someone else published a book with the same title for the same audience and apparently with the same theme. And if that has a degree of truth, successful entrepreneurs know too that execution matters more in the long run, which is the case as given that Brian's team kept focusing on AirBedAndBreakfast.com, which later became known as Airbnb.com, which later gave them strenght to beat the fierciful attacks of a major competitor [^footnote_airbnb_competition], which brought them to finally make more than 4 million hosts [^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts] and their guests happy. In other words, their hosts and guests would be also happy to know that they gave up working on "roommates.com" as the site was being worked on back in the days.   

[^footnote_airbnb_competition]: According to Brian's interview in *Brian Chesky on Launching Airbnb and the Challenges of Scale* (2015), the Samwer brothers emerged targeting Airbnb by exercising their proven ability to clone successful business models and rapidly scaling them, often outpacing some of the original innovators. Although they posed a significant challenge, Airbnb's unique value proposition and strong community engagement enabled them to thrive against such competition.

^footnote_airbnb_4millionhosts]: Since its inception in 2007, Airbnb has experienced phenomenal growth, evolving from a small startup where two hosts welcomed three guests to their home in San Francisco to a global platform with over 5 million hosts, according to "About Us," retrieved from https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/.

And althought these early movements can be respected as a sort of partial competitive analysis research work, I ask us to observe that of our propensity to value material findings of a specific domain, as these are interpreted as signs of the execution by steps that others in similar positions in the same domain. In other words, the building blocks do tell us what to do as well, and that can be quite strong to impact what we do, being to change our course or to join a course.

To be clear about our exploration, where we're going isn't too different from some considerations of the previous chapter, when we had considered how entrepreneurs might identify themselves with others like entrepreneurs, investors or their audiences. Likewise, these doers too trust too strongly the richness that is available from prior entrepreneurial movements that built which forms a dynamic space, which pulls action by the existence of platforms, by methods, by tools. Or, in other words, a space that acts like a framework or a playbook, that to a certain extent reveals that we essentially use domain-specific goggles, and especially in the modern and richer networked situation, it becomes even more evident the intensity of usage of platforms and tools and methods, and by that, it pulls the entrepreneur to respond as if the system prompts them to provide the answer.

To follow up, let us first look at the rise of some technological platforms which revals how the entreprenurial function is entangled with different spaces, and how it pulls them to the act of getting things done, which happens to provoke other spaces by its own capacity to prompt entrepreneurs for movement - a reflection that explores that the building blocks carry encoded messages of platforms, of a culture, or an economic system. Next, and developing a further exploration of other nuances from our environment, let us consider how interfaces, like the shape of tools and services, have an impact on us. And furthermore that our environment is also constructed by the minimal tools for collaboration, our vocabulary, the words that people use to do the things they want to do.
