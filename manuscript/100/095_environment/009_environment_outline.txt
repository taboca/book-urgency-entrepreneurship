## Outline 0.1 

* Pitch - The environment where entrepreneurship happens influences entrepreneurship. The space they operate, the interfaces they use, and the words; it's all connected with the environment. The point being is that we shouldn't be trapped in this environment. The environment is the opportunity for entrepreneurship, it is a space to be reconsidered and this is the space of opportunity.

* Outline - Complication - The so many additions and living in the box, we may not even notice things like what the humans are in need; We can be trapped by the platforms, frameworks, interfaces and the language. All of that can be the source but also the source of keeping us busy.
