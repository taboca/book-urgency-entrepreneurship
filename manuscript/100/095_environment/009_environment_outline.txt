# Environment 

Entrepreneurship happens in the environment and it is because of the environment and the environment embodies the people acting and relating in that space. That makes the environment for entrepreneurs or the space of opportunity, especially when it creates the demand and when some people use their imagination, their creative potential, feeling empowered to do something about it and with that it may be so that they put a dent in the environment and they launch solutions and tools that can be good for the environment or it may so change the situation of the environment. By that they may create new economic models and the environment evolves and sometimes it may feverishly evolve in ways that can be confusing if we are going in a good or bad direction but nonetheless what seems to be the direction that we are going shows that the potential for new technologies and changes in the environment are getting higher.

How it's complicated for entrepreneurs is that the environment influences them and their entrepreneurial actions and how they experience the world in every single way. They may be motivated to change something about the environment, or they may comply and enhance something, or they may be mad enough to rethink a given space in the environment. And as they do, the experience and how the perspectives and how they experience the environment is all connected not only with the environment, but also with the tools and the systems and the entities and the interfaces that they interact with. Furthermore, as they communicate and collaborate, it's also part of the environment, the vocabulary and the words that people use, and the cultural... and culture. So let us consider to pause for a while and reflect about some of these aspects of the environment in the hope of being a trip.
