* Pitch - The environment where entrepreneurship happens influences entrepreneurship. The space they operate, the interfaces they use, and the words; it's all connected with the environment. The point being is that we shouldn't be trapped in this environment. The environment is the opportunity for entrepreneurship, it is a space to be reconsidered and this is the space of opportunity. 

* @outline - All happens in a space; User needs depends on the space and their environment creates the needs too.
