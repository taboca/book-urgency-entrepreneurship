## It's a space 

Before we step further in the space of entrepreneurship, we shall celebrate first the situation of our environment that gives us the opportunities to work faster - to build things faster - given by the technological advancements that produced opportunities for reaching networks and using platforms that inescapably suggest infinite possibilities. It follows from that, a potential good reflection where we shall ask if these new grounds, which give us the power to act, are in any way directing us. 

Digging in our environnent may help us to see the invisible hands through the concretes in our spaces - technology - and how we smoothly run on these fast-paced platforms all together mobilized by the interactions from our networks that to a minimal level mobilize us with digital claps and likes. 

As we will set our hands dirt, let's recount the two ways in which the function modifies our own spaces and how it innovates our lives. The first, a less provocative way, the one generally known as incremental innovation, we will get back soon. As for the provocative way, which is more exciting and generally refered as the way "to put a dent in the universe," we can witness what it does as we go back in time, with Maury Klein from *The Power Makers*, and check how our ancestors reacted by the chugs and hisses of the early locomotives:

Now, being us here, able to rewind and recall the many revolutions in transportation from the early visions of the autonomous steam carriages [^footnote_oliverevans_oruktor], that set us in the driver's seat to feel and consider the incremental movements of innovation, such as to consider that we are not impressed at all when we see a human in the steering wheel of a car with the windows closed and listening to a song in the radio, bouncing her head, comfortably seated in the air conditioning, and being nursed by a thick milkshake that lasts for the whole traffic jam.

[^footnote_oliverevans_oruktor]: Oliver Evans' Oruktor Amphibolos is often considered the first amphibious vehicle and an early example of steam-powered machinery, representing a significant milestone in the history of engineering and invention. The Oruktor was detailed in Evans' patent, notable for being one of the first in the United States to cover a machine rather than a method of manufacture, granted in 1804.

Now if we look from the holistic perspective, such as the transformations in transportation as an example, we are not only facing the changes in the economic models and how we value the new values for exchanging values. We are grasping it too, the idea that the function doesn't directly hack in our lives but of its power to indirectly hack our lives by the concretes it produces, its givings, such as indirect givings by technology.

By these transformations given to us, we get to see values from the perspectives, by technologies, by platforms, by solutions, by the things which we operate our lives. In other words, we get comfortable with what we see and what we get as meaningful representations, as tools that allow us to exercise values. Or, we see values through the technologies that are given to us, we see values in the market that were given to us. In other words, we get used to what we see and what we get, given by the goggles of our present.

I particularly think that entrepreneurs aren't immune to that. Even if they're known as the ones that can change our spaces, breaking perspectives. In essence, they aren't different from the average worker, the average citizen, we are all builders. What essentially differentiates entrepreneurs, the more disruptive ones from the ones doing it in incremental ways or the ones doing it in ways which may be more like business as usual, might be about what they want to change that is outstanding because of given values. Or, which value existing concretes they want to break which are likely supported by some values, by offering other concretes that sees values from a different angle. Moreover, they want to be somebody doing that, able to get things done anyway, even if they are to be writers, to put a perspective out there that can be helpful to others, it does not matter.  Using a metaphor of a bridge, they become the bridge, bringing concretes from a space of the building blocks, or the means for doing it, and deploying new concretes in a target space, our living world.

### Bridging spaces 








In the end, we generally know - perhaps the optimists anyway - that the ideas behind the solutions brought to our spaces and lives comes from people that are living experiences first-hand, living the pains and needs, and valuing life and living aspirations, people that are optimistic to dreams for a better life, a better future, for themselves their friends and the civilization. A supporting point to that can be celebrated if we consider a phenomenon known as *User Innovation* [^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation] that explains that users innovate and that many inventions like basketball and Krav Maga or Braille are just iconic examples of a pattern which explains that user innovation is everywhere and that innovation comes first from real people and not from producers. 

[^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation]: MIT professor Eric von Hippel, through the credible book *Democratizing Innovation*, help us to extend further an understanding that the person who lives the experiences, the needs, are often the source of innovative solutions. The work recognizes characteristics of the phenomenon where users aren't passive recipients of products and services but active agents in their creation and refinement.

On the other hand, it is the entrepreneurial role that takes the credit for getting things done - at least up to this point since execution matters much more than ideas given that we don't have yet any miraculous ways to execute things. Therefore, it goes along that they are the ones being thankful, and frustrated, since they are caught between essentially two spaces. On one side, a source space, where they take things from, like the resources and the how-to elements. On the other side, the target space, where they deliver what they build, put to test, and put their hopes that people will buy-in. That view, although simplistic, take us to see them as a bridge and to follow the struggles as they interact with both sides. 










To illustrate the challenges of that unique position, let us go back in time when some of these builders had put a dent in the universe of the hail-riding experience and caused an impact to the traditional taxi industry. The advent of the iPhone meant for them a calling, given by the ring that people were buying that new three-in-one device, an internet communicator system, a phone, and a music player [^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone] as described by Steve Jobs in 2007. By 2008, additional incremental developments were noticed: an extended battery lifetime, support for the newly released 3G network (which meant higher speed and better connectivity to the internet,) plus what they already knew, that the iPhone had an integrated GPS support, which meant people's position could be tracked.

[^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone]: When introducing the iPhone (2012, June 29) during his keynote presentation at Macworld 2007, Steve Jobs famously described the device as a "three-in-one" product, integrating a phone, an iPod, and an Internet communications device. For reference, iPod had been considered a quite disruptive innovation for the need of listening to music.

Now, having them looked at that well, the exciting space where the building blocks were bubbling effervescently building blocks, they had turned their head to the target space, of people living their lives, especially taking rides. Their motivation Went along as they noticed people thirsty by the sweat and the heat of the traditional taxi space: If one wanted a ride, they could "get a cab" by making a phone call to a central. Or, if they were in a busy downtown area such as in New York, waving a hand to a yellow car or to walk to a specific taxi area. After entering the cab, on the other hand, a different experience is worth remembering. I remember the day when I left my phone in the a cab in California, San Francisco. The last thing I remember was that it was yellow and not lovely and neither a Mercedes-Benz. Plus that I couldn't call the cab driver to ask him to please bring me my phone. The lesson was "that you can never leave," your things in there. Another in-the-cab experience happened in Brazil - when I were a host to fellow friends from the California-based Mozilla Foundation - as we were in the streets of Porto Alegre at 70 mph and I were afraid to ask the driver to slow down while holding my hands tight and fearing the next day big news that the "Chairwoman of Mozilla dies in car crash in Brazil." 

Elements like that were good motivations that prompted some entrepreneurs to ask further questions before becoming that bridge: Are people really buying that expensive phone? Would it be possible to develop a solution where people could order a ride from any place by tapping the screen on the phone? Would they be able to monitor the car approaching and see how long it would take to pick them up? Is it possible to follow the movement of a car looking in a map in real-time? And to see the fares before accepting the ride, to pick the size of the car, to check or rate the driver behavior and other safety-related characteristics of the car? The more they asked the more that bridge seemed real which took them to follow up with a critical question: If a solution is to be developed, how easy/difficult would it be for people to install and tell others? Thankfully, Apple had created a space enabling that which were essentially a marketplace [^footnote_apple_marketplace] integrated in the phone. In other words, an iPhone user could discover applications, read more about who were the company behind, then able to install, and use it. 

[^footnote_apple_marketplace]: In 2008, Apple Inc. launched its "App Store" which consisted of being a digital marketplace bundled with the iPhones and enabling people to download applications, apps, fundamentally changing the way software is discovered, installed which market implications in terms of distribution and monetization.

The fact that some entrepreneurs had seen a green light - giving them a go-go to accelerate towards disrupting the old ways of the hail-riding experience - meant more about setting them into an entrepreneurial movement that is known - that the moment they start to bring something to the world reveals the reality that, in reality, things are different. Now, the fact that Uber grew as an iconic case - and had it pushed transformation to the hail-riding experience - can make difficult for many of us to see the struggle of these leaders trying to enter the space, how vulnerable their situation were, how challenging; which we will be supported by Brad Stone, from UpStarts (Stone, B., 2017), which brought the case of two companies that were right there and that, in a way or another and no mattering the actual business outcomes for each, were drivers in bringing transformation to the world of hail-riding as we knew.

By 2008 one of them were ahead in the game. That were TaxiMagic and they had an iPhone app was getting popular, available in 25 cities in U.S., and allowing riders to order standard cabs from their iPhones. Taxi Magic (later Curb) strategy trusted that the new was possible, knew that a lot would change in the future, but somehow the way to disrupt had to play, to a certain extent, fair with the existing situation characterized by what was referred as the taxi industry. Notice that for any "app" to get into that experience, given by the domain we had considered, it was quite challenging, such as for anyone to "plug" many modern technological methods to make the magic happen. Thus although Taxi Magic were playing fair with the taxi industry, it had to be magic to be able do that, such a big step. 

On the other hand, other cofounders came in late in the game - in contrast with Taxi Magic - but nevertheless early and eager to improve the hail-hailing experience from another angle, perhaps some of us could consider them the aggressive style. If we look at the original business presentation from UberCab (later Uber) - Uber's original pitch deck (2017, August 23) - there are clear considerations that the poor experience of ride taking having associations with the taxi monopolies. What we may see, from far and from now and if trying to put these companies in buckets too quick, could suggest that they were essentially strictly executing following a strict view as in that Taxi Magic were a player executing in the incremental way while UberCab the disrupting one.

What is revealled instead, by the recollections and interviews from Brad Stone, tells more that what they were doing had to do with figuring how technology could bring a better world, a better experience, to the best possible number of parties. In other words, UberCab and TaxiMagic were certain of the challenging situation by the monopolies by the taxi industry; and their strategies had certainly a lot to do with, first, finding the best way for the world to grasp a change. And this is where Bill Gurley, the partner from the renowed Silicon Valley venture capital firm Benchmark, comes to the scene. According to Brad Stone, Bill had engaged in "a prolonged courtship" with Taxi Magic - conversations that eventually arrived at an verbal offer of $8 million investment at a $32 million valuation (Stone, B., 2017, p. 71). For the deal to happen, tough, Bill were concerned that the best way to go had to do not with facing the traditional "yellow cabs," not up-front in the beginning anyway. The offer was declined by Taxi Magic, so Bill continued his ride which brought him to meet the founders of UberCab which were fine with the approach to start strategically competing with the "limo cars," or the black cars, thus not initially directly competing with the the yellow cabs. As we know from the history of Uber, the team that end-up receiving the investment of Bill Gurley and Benchmark Capital - they indeed started with that "limo space," or the black cars, but eventually launched their other products entering the space of the general taxi experience. 

They both in a way wanted to get there, but of course and in alignment with the words from Brad Stone, they were essentially moving further with philosophical differences. DePaschoale, the then-chairman of Taxi Magic, in the interview with Brad Stone had recognized that "Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably." His observations tell how tough things were, as they were in the arena, facing these cross-roads and knowing that they can't embrace all roads. But given that an experienced person like De Pasquale, and the maturity that that business had achieved, to use the word bet tells more about that reality, one that is far from gambling and arevelation about how vulnerable the situation in terms of decisions leading to outcomes, especially when things are working and growing.

* @todo/edit/decide - p2 ( ) - In Space / Bridging Spaces - According to Jordan Peterson it makes sense to compare ways of putting the prose. We have option A and B. Option A "In an interview given to Brad Stone, DePaschoale the then-chairman Taxi Magic, had recognized that "Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably." DePaschoale had given to us the feeling of how the perspective is felt when you are there, in the road, in front of cross-roads, where you can't embrace all and have to take a path. But given that an experienced person like De Pasquale, that were actually involved in the business that had achieved a certain level of maturity, to even use the word bet, it reveals not only the multiple potential bets in place, but that these were in fact different strategies or perspectives, as in theses, more than anything related with gambling. In other words, his phrasing that reveals a certain degree of humility, is not enough to hide the well-informed characteristizations of their strategies." And option B is "In an interview with the chairman of Taxi Magic, De Pasquale, his recognition that Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably, had much less to do with innocence or lack of professionalism and more in terms of revealing the size of the challenge they were onto. Given the experience of a professional like De Pasquale, quite involved in that business that had reached to a certain extent a level of maturity, to even use the word bet is more to do with the humbling spirit that went along the more these leaders get into the growth potential in a space where uncertainty is maintained at the proportion of the potential they unleash." / @meta-refid 1223-3321-2323-3344

That situation that appears to be a crossroad is essentially a revelation that, to a certain extent, they have to decide which way to take, how to proceed. In other words, what they are about to deliver - as they enter the space of the real world - using the concretes given by given things, needs to move further by being coherent, tangible,  marketable, and understood by people, and accepted by the world. The metaphor of the brigde might well fit to explain how they built, exactly because the bridge does not have a crossroad in it. While a bridge shows a strenght, if not a glamour by its golden ellegance in terms of connecting two potential spaces, it also reveals a its vulnerability. 

In this marriage, a proposition is for two forces, the How-to-do with the What-to-do, for the hopes that a new child is given, transformation and impact to the environment. Through that celebration, where the romantic notion is there and where love and energy are present, there is too the presence of other forces that are interested, like the forces of competition or the forces in favor; but basically everyone that is interested in what changes. From there, every single moment of materialization that follows essentially ask the question, again and again, "if anyone objects to these forces, please speak."

Next, we shall then celebrate how a notion of bundling [^foonote_bundling_old] gained significance in the modern business world as a result from the richer creations of entrepreneurship that gained distribution powers - i.e. the operating system or software systems bringing other systems together - essentially becoming platforms for delivery of values (plus other things) by exercising more direct influence in what the user is eating, or the user's plate. Thus, the observation that the whole world started to be concerned with the things "being bundled," within all things delivered to them, is in fact an effect from the fact that the business world had being busy exercising the potential of bundling things into things delivered. And likewise as an implication of that, we shall too consider the challenges since action of entrepreneurial world had too gained more dynamism by the existance of modular things - enabling entrepreneurs to bundle things quicker - which in turn sets them into challenges, exactly because things bundled from the world of entrepreneurial action is not untied from the entangled and existing world of prior things given. 

[^foonote_bundling_old]: A historical perspective about the usage of "bundling" from the past and the modern usage is given by in Bundling (2000) which elaborates about the original usage from an old courtship practice where young couples spent nights together in a single bed, either tied or "bundled" up to prevent physical intimacies; to the usage in modern business terminology where "bundling" referred to the strategy of selling multiple products or services together as a single package, offering convenience but also raising concerns about potential anti-competitive effects.
