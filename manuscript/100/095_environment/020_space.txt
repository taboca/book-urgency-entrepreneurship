## It's a space 

This section celebrates the richer terrain that is now given to use by richer networks and platforms, that set us in front of an expanded world of possibilities. And along with that, it asks from us a moment of reflection as for how these new grounds have the power to set us to act, to be directed. My hope is that by pausing to check on our environnent we can augument the invisible hands given by our spaces and to a certain extent be able to be able to silence the voices that so feverish tell us just do it. Let us remember that these voices in the digital and fast-paced world happens to be subtile movements of endorsement of our colleagues given by silent clicks or tapping a screen. 

Some of us are still able to set their hands on the ground and feel the earth - and the joy of a world they don't fully know how on earth it was brought and is what it is. Some of them maybe farmers too that knows what to do with the ground like things that farmers do. While, on the other hand, maybe in a parallel universe in the future, a kid gets to know that an egg comes from a chicken the minute that she sets her ommlet cartridge into the food printer and out of the sudden Clucky is projected, everyday with a different story just like the following example which I had asked an AI system to generate: 

> *"Here at Happy Hen Haven, we live our lives with joy and freedom. Our home is filled with comfortable spaces to roam, play, and flap our wings. And guess what? We eat the most delicious, natural grains you can imagine, with no antibiotics to spoil our meals. Yes, that's right! Our meals are as clean and healthy as the fresh water we sip under the sun. Now, you might wonder what happens to us after we lay our beautiful, nutritious eggs that makes your delicious ommelet. Well, let me tell you, our farm respects every chicken's journey, ensuring we live happily and peacefully. Our friends at the farm make sure we're always healthy and safe. They believe in treating us with kindness and love, which is why our eggs are so special. Enjoy your breakfast. "* ChatGPT by OpenAI 

But as we celebrate the new grounds brought by the entrepreneurial function, and how it sets an influence on us, we may start by the recognizion the two basic ways that function enters our lives, or that it innovate our lives. The first, the more common and less provocative way is known as incremental innovation; which we will get back soon. As for the other, the more provocative way which is what entrepreneurs refer to as "to put a dent in the universe," can be witnessed if we go back in time with Maury Klein from *The Power Makers*, and check how our ancestors reacted as they were greeted by the chugs and hisses of the early locomotives:

Some people even raised religious and moral objections.

It is the device of Satan to lead immortal souls down to Hell.'"* (Klein, 2009, p. 57)

But the actual given that we're here, able to rewing and recount many revolutions in transportation from the early visions of the autonomous steam carriages [^footnote_oliverevans_oruktor] to automobile, it set us in driver's seat taking control of the incremental movement of innovation, even to a point of not being impressed when we see a driver in a car behind the windows closed and listening to a song in the radio, comfortably seated in the air conditioning and being nursed by a thick milkshake that lasts for the whole traffic jam.

But if we look at these longer ride from a holistic perspective, starting with the locomotives that entered the tracks of our lives, we aren't just facing how technology changes the economic model and how we exchange value depending on it; but also technology brought ourselves to a new destination where we value technology; such as to value transportation - such as to desire for a faster horse. 

And here again, there is an opportunity to recognize how the function doesn't directly hack into our lives, but it does so indirectly by hacking our own spaces. And for a second if think that entrepreneurs are immune to that, it may be only so because they get the prizes after the changes brought by the ones that succeeded. But that doesn't hide the fact that they might be just another normal worker, the average citizen that in essence takes elements from a space, taking their resources and building blocks from space A and essentially bringing these elements, although arranged in different ways, to a new space B, essentially becoming a bridge.

While this is our next station - to see entrepreneurs in the mddle of two dynamic spaces using tools and building tools - we shall ride through the not far history how how the smartphone evolved to a point that it gave entrepreneurs the motivations to deploy innovation in the space of hail-riding and with that disrupt the taxi industry.

### Bridging spaces 





In the end, we generally know - perhaps the optimists anyway - that the ideas behind the solutions brought to our spaces and lives comes from people that are living experiences first-hand, living the pains and needs, and valuing life and living aspirations, people that are optimistic to dreams for a better life, a better future, for themselves their friends and the civilization. A supporting point to that can be celebrated if we consider a phenomenon known as *User Innovation* [^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation] that explains that users innovate and that many inventions like basketball and Krav Maga or Braille are just iconic examples of a pattern which explains that user innovation is everywhere and that innovation comes first from real people and not from producers. 

[^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation]: MIT professor Eric von Hippel, through the credible book *Democratizing Innovation*, help us to extend further an understanding that the person who lives the experiences, the needs, are often the source of innovative solutions. The work recognizes characteristics of the phenomenon where users aren't passive recipients of products and services but active agents in their creation and refinement.

Yet the given is that the entrepreneurial role takes big part of the credit for getting things done - and for bringing the solutions at the right time and space. That should bring us to recognize that they are the ones that get excited and thankful or frustated and mad about two different spaces at the same time. In other words, they are in between two different worlds: one where they take resources from, a source space, and the other, the target space where they put their creations to be test. That view, although simplistic, can take us to their position in a bridge and then to be the ones living very specific challenges, such as the tension, between what happens on both ends. 

For a better illustration of this entanglement, and the elasticity demanded from these doers, we shall go back to not so far in time, around 2007, and consider what happened that provoked some of these doers to want to put a dent in the universe of the hail-riding experience - the experience of taking rides - and to cause a major impact in the taxi industry later. With the advent of the iPhone by 2007, one thing some entrepreneurs knew, that people were excitingly buying that three-in-one device as promoted by Steve Jobs - of an internet communicator system, a phone, and a music player [^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone]. 

In addition to that, now by 2008, they were also tracking other incremental improvements delivered to the iPhone platform, such as extended battery lifetime, support for the newly released 3G network which meant higher speed and better connectivity to the internet, and not to forget that the iPhone alread had a GPS mechanism as the means for enabling their solutions to track the locations of people carrying these phones.

[^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone]: When introducing the iPhone (2012, June 29) during his keynote presentation at Macworld 2007, Steve Jobs famously described the device as a "three-in-one" product, integrating a phone, an iPod, and an Internet communications device. For reference, iPod had been considered a quite disruptive innovation for the need of listening to music.

With that, and granted that these exciting building blocks were available from that (Apple's) source space, they logically turned their attention to the target space - the places where people where and their lives, which prompted them to rethinking of the ways to taking rides in the major cities around the world. Logically, with the intention of improving their experience, which by the way were logically at the time framed by an specific experience defined by all the prior incremental developments of the the taxi industry; such as that if one wanted to order a ride, they would need to call a central from their phone, or to wave their hands at some of the cars identified by a yellow car in some of the cities around the world, or to go to a specific taxi spot first, and after that once the ride started, to comply with many other rules. As an aside, I remember the day when I left my phone in a cab in San Franscisco and how comfortable I was to know that I would never see it again. But another experienced was tougher when I felt trapped in a complex situation being a host to my friends from Mozilla organization visiting Brazil and caught myself taking a ride in the streets of Porto Alegre at 110 km/h afraid to ask the driver to reduce the speed at the same time holding my hands tight and fearing a big news for the next day that "Mozilla contributor Marcio Galli kills the chairwoman of Mozilla," or a more attractive headline like "How Mozilla crashed and died in Brazil." 

And since these entrepreneurs could see that the bridge seemed real linking these two different spaces, that led them to ask further questions such as, are these people really buying this actually quite expensive iPhone thing? Would it be possible for them to give them an experience where they could call a ride for any place in the city by tapping the screen on their phone where they could see the driver in the screen, how far they were, how long they would take, and even follow them in the map in real time? If they could see the fares ahead of time before saying yes or no, to pick the size of the car, and logically, much more, such as to rate the driver behavior, if he and if she were driving safe or not.

Moreover, many other questions came along, the more the bridge seemed real. One of them would be to ask how difficult it would be for people to install that new experience in their iPhones. Thankfully, for these developers and for iPhone users, Apple had created a place for people to browser and install these experiences which is essentially an marketplace [^footnote_apple_marketplace] integrated in the phone. Basically, any user using an iPhone would be able to browse through many different applications from different companies, to read about the company offering them, to trust knowing that Apple had some information about the producers, and to then install. For developers, that meant a way to distribute, an easier way for their users to install, and in addition to that, as a consequence, what would enable the word of mouth. These and other conditions seemed to be a green light for them to move on, to proceed to disrupt the hail-riding industry or the cab industry or taxi industry as you wish. 

[^footnote_apple_marketplace]: 







But all of that, still, is about the visualization of the bridge and has anything to do with the getting things done. And the actual challenge that these pioneers will leave as they try to do it, as they enter the space, what brings them to say that reality is different, which we will follow with Brad Stone, of Upstarts (Stone, B., 2017). 

Moving forward to 2008, an iPhone app known as Taxi Magic was becoming popular in the U.S. as it had expanded across 25 cities, giving riders the ability to order standard taxis from their phones. That perspective shows that the strategy of Taxi Magic were essentially improving the existing situation, probably challenging some of the aspects, but essentially playing fair and in agreement to the taxi industry. On other hands, of other founders, they thought that in order for riders to have a better experience, the known situation of the hail-hailing experience needed to change. If we look at the original business presentation from Uber - Uber's original pitch deck (2017, August 23) - they point to the poor experience of ride taking as connected with the taxi monopolies.

Now that history shows that Uber survived, and given that many riders don't even know the world as it were before, can be challenging for us to see how these founders were struggling at the time. According to Brad Stone, these were philosophicaly differences. For Taxi Magic leadership, a particular moment had challenged them to reconsider their views, when Bill Gurley - the renowed partner of Benchmark Capital later to be known as the major investor in Uber - had engaged in what was referred as "a prolonged courtship" (Stone, B., 2017, p. 71) that culminated in an offer of $8 million in investment [^footnote_bradstone_investment_uber] which was declined. 

[^footnote_bradstone_investment_uber]: According to Brad Stone, the conversations between Taxi Magic and Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, had eventually arrived at an verbal offer from Bill Gurley, who proposed an $8 million investment at a $32 million valuation (Stone, B., 2017, p. 71).

Given the experience of a professional like De Pasquale, quite involved in that business that had reached to a certain extent a level of maturity, to even use the word bet is more to do with the humbling spirit that went along the more these leaders get into the growth potential in a space where uncertainty is maintained at the proportion of the potential they unleash." / @meta-refid 1223-3321-2323-3344

In other words, his phrasing that reveals a certain degree of humility, is not enough to hide the well-informed characteristizations of their strategies. 





And that brings us to the revelation of other aspects in the struggle between the more incremental approach, which is playing by the rules, or the more disruptive approach, to provoke the space, or even the possibility of a strategy that shifts from one to the other, as in to unleash the disruptive after what seems to be the incremental; which may be particularly recognized when Bill Gurley approached De Pasquale as part of the inclinations for investments, and had advised De Pasquale to step away, initially from the taxior the "yellow cabs," as known in the U.S., positioning the service closer to the category of the "limo cars" instead, deferring the full potential for a future chapter. As we know from the history of Uber - the team that end-up receiving the investment of Bill Gurley and Benchmark Capital - were actually in that limo space, or black cars; but eventually took over and impacted the space of the general taxi experience.

That situation that appears to be a crossroad is essentially a revelation that, to a certain extent, they have to decide which way to take. In other words, that what they need to deliver to the target space is something that needs to be built. Something that is tangible, coherent, marketable, and understood by people, and likewise by the competition or anyone else that objects. That new thing in the space. If that's not enough of a challenge, it brings us to the challenges and concerns of the modern business world and the dynamic environment of entrepreneurship, where they are challenged to consider that they do bundle things and unbundle. Not in the sense that they are able to quickly refactor the entire organization, but in essence that that consideration of refactoring anything thought is more relevant as the world becomes more dynamic. In other words, that if anything bundled has ties with other spaces, unbundling reveals the reconsideration of these ties and the dynamic nature of these spaces.

### Bundle and unbundle 

Sometimes, if not generally, we get acquainted with new terms by the on-the-fly practice, when we are suddenly in a new working space and someone throws a tool and before you know you catch it and a you are told to keep cranking. The term 'bundled' came to me like that because it was said a lot within the buildings at Netscape - the iconic company that created or popularized, or bundled, the internet browser. Once in the field I essentially became part of a machine of people that we were *bundling* an internet browser. As an aside, I shall note that my passion for English had origins from the world of programming languages. So words like *While*, *If*, *Then*, *For* and others had influenced me to sometimes say things like: *While* I am here, working in United States, I am happy to build things *Until* some major event calls me back to Brazil. *If* friends invite me to dinner, *Then* I shall comply.  

But it was after I returned to Brazil - and had a bit of time - that I found something more about bundle, that bundle had to do with unbundle, by listening to the thoughts from some of the leaders of Netscape, Jim Barksdale and Marc Andreessen. 

Now I know that the situation of entrepreneurs who pushed them, especially in the beginning and also in the long run, to generally not refactor their offerings or to unbundle whatever they had thought and had bundled. Likewise as anything built is essentially built by the fact that their bridge were bundled in the first place and that may involve the managerial means. That leaves the idea of unbundling an offering to connect to the necessity of the unbundling of the bridge and reveal the ties of multiple spaces, which could be quite challenging because you are re-evaluating your sources, which is not generally a consideration, not until the act of getting things done consumes resources. Yet the recognition of the unbundling or the bundling-unbundling dynamics is a real movement that creates challenging situations in shorter cycles exactly because of the dynamic space such as where the competition exists and bundles things with ties with different spaces, which set us to at least verify an exploration that luckily was given to us through a great exercise, led by entrepreneurs and executives that had disrupted and invented the Internet browser, popularized the Internet browser and went through the necessity to rethink the offerings and not only setting the product in a different way, but setting the bridge in different ways, as told by Jim Barksdale from the days when he was the CEO of Netscape [^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale] going through the rise of the Mozilla project.

[^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]: The idea of bundle and unbundle is generally promoted by Marc Andreessen, one of the creators of the first popular internet browser that co-founder of Netscape. Marc is a well-known investor and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, A16z, an iconic venture capital firm from Silicon Valley. 

To consider this narrative, let us situate ourselves in the days that the incremental innovations in the space of the Internet brought the Web. Yes, so the Web was brought to the people that could understand and navigate the Internet space. But that wasn't the web for normal users anyway. The Web for normal users came about because the Internet browser were invented. Thus, in the space of people - reading news - something new came up to them, it seemed to be a thing disrupting newspapers anyway, the Internet browser. Netscape was built, and they indee had put a dent in the universe. The browser was something bundled, a product. Once the user had downloaded it, it was coherent. If your computer is connected to the Internet, you can then type the address of a company, and voilá, the page shows. So all were nice, and Netscape were growing and their proprietary technology, their bundled things like the Netscape Navigator, were an excitement that led Netscape to be the highest IPO in history. 

That up the moment when Microsoft decided to look at what a browser really meant. To simplify a long battle - known as browser wars - Microsoft had bundled a free Internet browser in its Windows operating system, thus making it not necessary for many people to even download Netscape. In other words, Microsoft affected the space of Netscape, and with that the evident notion that Netscape product could only be used "on top" of Windows, thus that Netscape was a customer of Windows to a certain extent. This is where the idea of bundle and unbundle sets in more properly, not only because Microsoft had bundled Internet Explorer but because the bundled Netscape, as it is, led Netscape as a company to be bleeding and bleeding fast. This also took Netscape to consider to rethink its strategy.

--> 

In an interview for Justin Fox, for Harvard Business Review (Fox, 2014), Jim Barksdale recalled line came about during Netscape's public offering roadshow. Jim and his team were at the Savoy Hotel in London, pressed for time and facing a room full of British investment bankers. When questioned about Microsoft's potential to bundle a browser into their product - “How do you know that Microsoft isn’t just going to bundle a browser into their product?” - he made a statement for how an innovative competitor product were essentially consist the destrution of the values of its competition and by that it would ground itself as new values: "Gentlemen, there’s only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling," and followed by "Well, best I can tell, most people spend half their time adding and other people spend half their time subtracting, so that’s what works out, " so satisfy the needs of an audience that were puzzled but curious. 

According to Jim, although the comment wasn't carefully crafted, it was intuitive and captured the truth that innovations essentially deals with adding and subtracting elements of a given value proposition. 

To illustrate the challenges of the forces behind Bundling and Unbundling, we may recount the history of the internet browser and the rise of the web, which Marc Andreessen and Jim Barksdale, along with others, had the opportunity to witness and be part of the whole experience and the tension between these forces. As history shows, Netscape arrived and launched a worldwide popular browser back in the days and became the highest IPO in history at that point by the bundling of the web browser, the means to navigate the web, which was a proprietary technology and tied with the internet building blocks and the notions and the concepts and the standards of the web that were evolving, incrementally evolving, if you will. At that point, with the new experience unleashed, many people became excited because that was basically like accessing the addresses of companies worldwide, navigating, enabling all sorts of new services like search and indexes and Yahoo, AltaVista, and many companies were able to have websites online. Everything was fine and great, the greatest IPO ever, up to the point that we realized that the internet browser had to run on top of another platform. The Windows operating system was the most popular among normal users. And with that, the challenging moment became when Netscape were challenged by Microsoft as Microsoft had bundled a free browser, Internet Explorer, to the Windows popular operating system. It should be noted, as early noted by people from Netscape, that people had to manually install the Netscape browser, by hand, which meant that overnight Netscape were bleeding. That is what had characterized part of the browser wars, and even the lawsuit against Microsoft for unfair practices. 

But the point - going straight or back to bundling and unbundling is exactly what were happening back in the days as Gene Barks recognized that they had to do something and the response had to do with the unbundling. If they kept the way it is, they would lose the war, of course, they were losing quite fast, they were bleeding, but the response was a very aggressive response, they had to do with facing their death as a company. So if we had to kill ourselves, what would we do it, right? And the response went along with incremental developments because open source were happening at that point and many of these companies were using open source technologies and the browser became this iconic case of a major project being open sourced by Netscape, that's the rise of the Mozilla project, according to CodeRush.

The notions of bundling and bundling, as we have seen through the Netscape browser history, also reveals not only the characteristics of adding and subtracting elements of a given setting, but also the interdependencies, like when a given creation is grounded in a given platform. And along with that, the possibility that other forces - like the competition or an industry - might be exploring aspects of the undelying platform, which gives us the invitation to consider that the rise of a platform is nested inside other platforms or entangled with other spaces. Therefor, let us look at the history of Silicon Valley, or in other words, how Silicon Valley was bundled, as an opportunity for us to exercise the potential and directedness of platforms, either influencing us or giving us the possibility to rethink that.

By now, we may summarize that the phenomenon of bundling and unbundling may happen at the surface, which could be like incremental innovations, which is a softer approach, or it can be harder where it accesses the core or the underlying elements that enables a potential disruptive innovation. In the case of Netscape, to a certain extent, they were forced in a position to make a decision and to revisit underlying concepts enabling the product to be bundled in different ways. Therefore, when they had embraced open source - for a product that were proprietary - they arrived at that to a certain extent motivated by the competition. On the other hand, that was possible because the community of engineers and in special pioneers in the forefront of open-source had envisioned the of elements from the different space of open-source - and new methods for building things - that could reinvent collaboration in new ways which would be the challenges they had to do as the code open would demand the means to manage contributions from a lot of external people. In other words, once they embraced that popular bundled experience to be based in open-source, they took themselves to embrace other challenges such as to enable the full potential of collaboration. This, from Netscape to Mozilla to Firefox is to recognize that the underyling refactoring of managerial movement were happening and quite successful. 

What we have considered by the prior illustrations and anecdotes, shall set us to embracing the infinite possibilities where anything that changes a space has ties with multiple different spaces and its underlying assumptions, or the means to get things done from these, which makes evidently clear that entrepreneurship deals with that choreographic movement that needs to be done in harmony and to produce what is coherent which is essentially a management aspect.




Yet, this complex arrangement of what's bundled, given that it is tied with so many relationships with different spaces and needs to get done, brings to us the complicated reality that it's not easy to see all these different ties. And furthermore, the more we advance, it's more normal that people enter a given space and start building things, not knowing necessarily what's behind all that. As an example, if a kid loves a game and inside that game develops friendships with colleagues, and as she grows and sees values in that paricular universe it may to a certain extent become part of her normal life thus influencing her growth towards being an adult - or towards maturity. And that's certainly what's happening to many of us, because either social networks or social games and the ideas of the experiences given by the metaverse are essentially worlds that were built first; and it may well be the case that the players, or the users, or customers or call them whatever you want, really know what's going on behind the world as they see it. The way that I realized that was by witnessing the situation of my niece and her relationship with what were apparently a game platform - Roblox - as she guided me to understand a little bit about that world. What I took from her guidance was that I had entered a digital gaming platform where multiple users could play together, interact. As she had invited me to a specific city, I had noticed interactions between players like a community. And things were fine, and she even got excited because she started to create movies of herself acting in that city - in other words she were recording the screen with her character - her avatar - and even got to a point of making scripts, asking her friends to collaborate. But then, one day, she was quite sad because she received the news that the city would go away, because she heard that the developer were considering to kill his server. I don't know what happened there, if that was a rumor or not, but seemed to be something the end of the world anyway; like a prediction. Nevertheless, it is a good illustration of how one can be pretty involved, not only because of the intrinsic values by the social dynamics within the game, but because of extra values that these dynamics may give to them, which was the case of the extra meaning for my niece in the real world - the thing about making movies - although a more simple example of value that transcends can be the observation of friendship or colleagueship among players. 


Of course, this example of children growing as a user of a specific universe may be scary to some parents, or, could be seen as educational to a certain extent by others, like the possibility that people could understand moral values such as the meaning of loss. But even more concerning can be that the very same effect happens in the world of adults. As an example, developers in the information technology industry may value underlying technologies - such as open source - which could set them to be attracted by other opportunities that depend on open-source. As an another example, if one is involved in other themes like the underlying foundations of cryptocurrencies, they may well endorse systems or platforms created on top of networks that they trust, that they love and are involved with. And that again, it may not be a problem, it could be that they see a future in there, granted; but yet still it reveals that we are entangled and driven by a forward movement which is tied to other movements in different spaces. Let us then go proceed to explore a bit about the magnitude of these entanglements by looking at a brief moment in the history of Silicon Valley and some of the  bundling and unbundling movements that had chaptered in Silicon Valley.






#### Growing in a growing space 

Because of the too many ties for anyone to understand - if not boring for a business book - I thought of giving us a viewpoint for how I had witnessed the formation of digital platforms, as a kid from the age of ten, around 1985, and moving forward along with the growth of the information technology industry to a point of moving to Silicon Valley. Not different from many other folks that were taken by computers, for me it something new started as I had witnessed some of the first video games, then the early personal computers, then the emergence of the internet browser, then witnessing the early mobile phones - up to now that I have a quite powerful smartphone that receives too many notifications to the point that I had to install "an app" referred as a digital well-being app that allowed me to turn off many of the online apps too so that I can actually get to work, and do focused work, like what I am doing now. 

The origin of seeing things as platforms, or spaces, started to grow from around 1985. These where the days when video games existed already so it was exciting to be growing around these systems. But generally with video games it was sad that we had no way to create those games, or to modify them ourselves. One could only dream and wonder about how these games were made, of course excited about the possibilities of modifying it - What if I could change the clothes of the hero? Of what if I could change the color of the background, or the number of lives, and more. But it didn't take long before my father brought the personal computer. This was a different box because it also had games in it but it had something else which was a more acessible door inviting us to do that kind of custom work. That was the message. You can use the same machine to actually write new things that runs in the machine. And a kid would naturally ask - can all be done from that? And the answer was yes, one could engage and create software systems, and even other video games. 

So the first thing to learn was what the technical folks would call *The Operating System* and too other esential tool referred as *The Programming Language*. With a programming language you can write your own game. So I took that as the truth which made me assume that the computer I had was a thing that enabled the development of games. Since my goal was to build my own game I tried. But it didn't take long for me to start to understand that the programming language that I were using was too simple or limited. So my game seemed to be impossible with the platform I were using. The solution I heard was that I had to write games in a more complex programming language what the technical folks refer as *The Machine Language*. Needless to say that I had no pointers like access to the Internet. The books we had were magazines and I likely didn't express to my parents my intents to dive into that level of detail. So, I had decided to pivot since I were anxious for results and tried to do something more simple. 

Also time were moving and I would be by now using a better computer. Since I liked to draw I tried to make a software for drawing what the technical folks would refer as a graphics editor. Although that seemed simpler comparing with video games, and I went quite further, I caught myself again limited by the tools I were using or limited by the complex thinking involved to make that work with the limited resources too. Since I couldn't really make that graphics software how I wanted I endup feeling like being somebody usefaul writing software solutions for the world of adults, what technical folks refer as commercial systems. 

Those were simple, I felt as somebody useful and could even help some adults too. It was exciting and this is how I came to understand that systems for people, or what technical folks would refer as users, were written using programming languages, the things that developers could write games, or graphic editors, or word processors and commercial applications. So right there I would be an user experiencing a number of platforms. To consider the evident ones, first the computer itself. And "on top of that," as the technical professional would say, there is an operating system. And on top of that operating system, the tools for programming. Another evident observation is how I were able to do things, like to write my own software system, but too had to respect the limits of these platforms, to use the tools that they had offered. 







If we follow the story of a kid growing around computers, and a tiny slice of the world of computers, and the growth of the information technology industry, up to the web and the world of browsers, we're likely not missing the phenomenon that out of that being unleashed because of the economic opportunity, in other words, newspaper companies had become content providers in the digital world, just as a tiny example. But along with that, the inevitability of a movement where a kid could be becoming a professional in a given new space that was promising and growing. In other words, the world of browsers, its tools and related underlying systems was evolving exactly because of the economic model and characteristics of the space potential. As for my case, I ended witnessing the formation - and getting paid along - of the Web Developer role [^footnote_marcio_web_developer], which brought myself to be invited to work at one of the iconic companies of the time - Netscape - which were amazing to navigating that space. But the important point for us is evidently formed by now - that the space is quite real, and one can be quite busy exactly because of that intense movement which may also become a sort of inertial movement. While a lot is changing and you may feel like somebody, it should also be recognized that a lot seems immutable, for one in the craft looking the building blocks they are comfortable with. So for me it too had seen walls in that source space, given by the building blocks that the browser makers and web makers had produced. Yes, the knowing that I was working around the people making the browser gave me a reasonable hint about how the underlying reality we flexible; but it couldn't give me a full view, a transcending view, about what were the underlying things happening. I did not have the time to understand the relativeness of all, and even to understand if I were trapped or not, how to escape, for instance, such as to access the day which I would embrace becoming a writer. And even for the bright minds that may become leaders of these major platforms - they too can be carried but what happens. I would think that the leaders of the social networks that had been wildly and widely embraced by people really didn't mean to enable people to be siloed within their own groups of afinity and where their supporters would echo their beliefs. With all the good intentions, from the optimistic perspective, the rise of social networks started with that premise that one could meet anyone in the world with the six degrees of freedom - anyone is not far from the president. I recall those days and that ideal. But too, I confess, by following the movement, I didn't notice when the social network became a world that were to create to me six degress of walls. 

[^footnote_marcio_web_developer]: The web developer, formed after the Internet browser enabled organizations to make sites and software systems available through web browsers. The web developer would then become a worker for the medium of the Web. https://hackernoon.com/the-history-of-web-developers-tied-to-browser-development





Thus it comes with that too, that even in the digital space, we shall be set under conditions that can be quite difficult to see the miracle of how these tools and systems and arrangements are formed and how one thing depend on another on so many levels of abstractions, especially when we are busy and producing. Perhaps, we get a bit of that feeling that something else exists when out of the sudden we get to be disconnected; in my case when it was a day when the electricity went off out of the sudden. More younger ones would recall the same feeling if the Internet went off - it is then when some infrastructure that we take for granted is taken out that we in fact almost get interested in celebrating how far too many things are interconnected. 




Let's extend this idea a bit further with Maslow from *Memorandum on Syndrome Dynamics and Holistic, Organismic Thinking*, an strange title perhaps but as strange as us taking for granted all that makes any of these spaces possible: 

> *"The fact is that the enterprise, let's say Non-Linear Systems, is embedded in its immediate community; in all sorts of specifiable ways this immediate community is embedded in the larger community, let's say the Southern California area, which in turn has very definite and functional relationships with the state of California, which in turn is embedded in the United States, which in turn is embedded in the Western world, which in turn is embedded in the whole darn human species and the whole darn world. There are functional relationships in the sense that demonstrable causes and effects can be listed, and they can be listed by the thousands. The fact that these are normally overlooked and taken for granted has nothing to do with the case. For instance, the fact that Non-Linear Systems has just one night watchman instead of a private army of three thousand people equipped with machine guns and cannon is taken for granted, but this can be taken for granted only when the relationships work so well. Or the fact that the enterprise is dependent upon the town for the supplies of water, electricity, and gas, for the maintenance of roads, for fire and police departments, not to mention doses of other services like restaurants and shopping centers and markets and the like, which make it possible for people to live in the area, which makes it possible in turn for them to work in the plant. If anybody who worked at non-linear systems took a risk of being assassinated on the main street, then the enterprise would, of course, disappear. This should be spelled out; it should be consciously understood that Non-Linear Systems rests on a whole network of assumed relationships, services, etc. It is, in a word, "contained within" as in a syndrome, or even more accurately it is "contained-and-structured within."* (Maslow, p. 135)

Having us consider the effects of a kid growing inside spaces created by revolutions in Silicon Valley, open source and other underlying developments of the web from all the places of the world We may then recognize some other side of this equation, which is the movements that happen in terms of disruptive innovation and then incremental innovation in terms of the underlying platforms technological platforms given Silicon Valley, informing Silicon Valley







#### The expanding universe 


To further explore these entanglements, we may go dig into the computer's history, first looking at the computer microprocessor and the little elements that can't be seen with the naked eye but nevertheless required a new sight from management in order to evolve. The tiny element inside processor is known as the transistor and where a big invention back in 1947 [^foonote_history_transistor].  This element is also referred as a semiconductor device but it is one that acts as a switch that can either allow or not allow energy to flow depending on a signal. An exampe of a big switch would be a door in a room that allows one to go out, if the door is open, so then once out she shouts out information. Now the magic in the computer world happens because transistors can be arranged with others and can form the microprocessor. If I insist with the door analogy, the microprocessor would be a big house with lots of doors where some of these doors openned could open of close others. 

Well, and before my analogy confuses both of us, let us move to the a ballpark figure comparing the evolution of these microprocessors. The then-popular personal computer known as the IBM PC from 1981, which was a significant point in the computing history, carried an Intel microprocessor that had about 29,000 transistors [^footnote_history_transistor_count]. Fast-forward 39 years, the Apple Iphone 12 powered by Apple's A14 Bionic microprocessor carries around 11.8 billion transistors. In other words, in terms of transistors, an Iphone 12 microprocessor is about 406,000 times in terms of transistors comparing to an IBM-PC from 1981.  We should remind ourselves that the size of the transistors became much smaller, enabling faster response and less usage of battery, for example, so as for the last analogy it would be tittle little castle. 

[^foonote_history_transistor]: The transistor, a fundamental building block in the world of electronics, was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Laboratories. This groundbreaking invention marked the beginning of a new era in electronic technology, enabling the development of smaller, more efficient, and more reliable devices. 

[^footnote_history_transistor_count]: As noted in the Wikipedia article "Transistor count" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count), estimates are provided for the transistor count of the Intel 8086 chip and the 8088 chip used in the IBM PC. The article also includes information on the transistor count for the Apple iPhone 12's chip, A14 Bionic microprocessor, among others.

Since obviously our idea is not to get technical but to celebrate the relativeness between these spaces, let's shift our focus to the history of Silicon Valley, back to 1956 when Shockley Semiconductor were founded by the co-inventor of the transistor in the beautiful Santa Clara Valley - a region of California known at the time for an agriculture producing orchards, apricots, prunes, cherries, plums, and more. I have used an AI tool to doublecheck information about William Shockley by asking "Was Shockley that went to live in the bay area with his mother?," to which the tool replied: 

> *"Yes, William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor and Nobel Prize laureate, moved to the Bay Area, specifically Mountain View, California, in 1956 to be closer to his ailing mother. This move was significant because it led to the establishment of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, the first semiconductor company in the place that would be later known as Silicon Valley. Shockley's decision to relocate there and start his semiconductor company played a crucial role in the development of Silicon Valley as a major hub for high-tech innovation and development."* ChatGPT, 2024. 

As an aside, the transistors made by Shockley Semiconductor were made of Germaniun, while later Silicon became a more suitable  material for transistors; which explains why we call it Silicon Valley and not Germanium Valley. Another aside that I don't want to check the accuracy comes from when I first visited the Netscape campus back in 2000 and driving around the parking lot I asked my manager "what is that interesting object that looks like a little lighthouse?" To which he said that it was a super fan probably pulling chemicals from the ground and dumping far away in the air. I don't know if he was joking or not but I was scared and wondered about how things were before our days - the browser days. Now I remember too that from time to time a very shiny - and likely expensive equipment - would appear at different locations in our building. They told me that those were there to measure the quality of the air. 

Now if we consider some of the transformations from 1956 - the Shockley days - to 1981 when Intel were unbundling their own 8086 platform architecture and bundling Intel's next generation of microprocessors, we will see it too how these technological developments went along with the needs for new management perspectives. 



#### Creative destruction of management 


From the founding of Intel to backwards, we can track that Intel were founded by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore. And if we rewiend more, we'll find that these same individuals happened to be part of a team of founders known at the time as *The Traitorous Eight* [^footnote_trairorous_eight] - a group of colleagues from Shockley Semiconductor that left and had founded Fairchild Semiconductor. 

[^footnote_trairorous_eight]: The "Traitorous Eight" refers to the eight engineers and scientists who left Shockley Semiconductor due to dissatisfaction with management. They were Gordon Moore, C. Sheldon Roberts, Eugene Kleiner, Robert Noyce, Victor Grinich, Julius Blank, Jean Hoerni and Jay Last; and founded Fairchild Semiconductor; which opens our minds to consider how the idea of leaving a company, and with it its management practices and culture, were connected to the needs of a market in development. 

The history around the *Traitorous Eight* is an invitation for a reflection for how the bundling of a new technological opportunity may depend on unbundling other fundamental elements in the space of management and even culture: While William-Shockley-the-inventor was brilliant the William-Shockley-the-manager was considered to be terrible by colleagues which prevented the opportunity ahead and led these eight colleagues to leave Shockley to create Fairchild Semiconductor. And if you are reading this wondering "what a big deal to leave bad management" keep in mind that in 1957 the idea of an employee leaving a company were considered as wrong - very wrong - which led Shockley to describe their leaving as a betrayal (Wikipedia, 2024).

Now, allow me to see all of these companies as like departments of a one big company. With that, we can then proceed to think that Shockley had produced Fairchild. As as seen, that Fairchild brought Intel. But not only Intel, as according to *Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley* (2016, December 20), Intel was one of other 126 spin-off companies also known as Fairchildren.

--> 

Now let's consider the possibility that the *Traitorous Eight* - as an event up to the point that Shockley having accused them of being traitors - could have accelerated a process waiting to happen: that it produced an impact in the views especially in Silicon Valley, minimally and initially to the people working at Fairchild Semiconductor, producing more open views such as for leaving a company, such as in circumstances of bad management.

It is expected too that Fairchild had a better management and as well that its employees would not not fear much to consider creating new companies where many of them may be amond the 126 spin-off Fairchildren [^footnote_fairchild] companies. This event and managerial movements would likely produce a shift in the culture of the people working in Silicon Valley not only in terms of needs for better management but producing a mindset for openness which were essential elements a development of that industry and technological revolution. 

[^footnote_fairchild]: According to Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley Fairchild Genealogy (2016, December 20), a published print known as Fairchild Genealogy chart from 1986 included 126 semiconductor companies that were traced directly to Fairchild.

And if we keep forwarding the Silicon Valley movie all the way to Intel days yet focusing on the managerial perspective, we get to celebrate the writings of Andy Grove, Intel's first hire that later became CEO and the author of the influencial management book entitled High Output Management. While High Output Management has produced direct impact to a lot of other innovators in Silicon Valley and around the world, is it too the historical proof of the managerial transformation and how quick these new managers had to do something about it. To note, Andy Grove wrote High Output Management and Only the Paranoid Survive while working at Intel. 

<!--
@meta @todo
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Environment, Space - Check reference if Andy Grove were really first hire. @meta-refid 1212-2223-3392-9394
--> 



As a matter of fact, the very new management practices that Andy Grove were involved with for many years during the challenging days of Intel led Intel to enter a new space of opportunity, leaving Intel as a memory manufacturing company, becoming Intel, which became widely known as the microprocessor manufacturing company and the realizations of the new space of opportunity since the microprocessors were becoming the central element of enabling value in the face of the emerging and growing needs and access of personal computers by people. Which takes us to understand the realization that Andy Grove had that the configuration of the personal computers inside small businesses and homes of people and all sorts of different businesses were actually becoming a central platform where all sorts of values would be able to be added on top or inside that space by all sorts of companies. Therefore, the fruition by the creative potential of many other entrepreneurs that wanted to contribute inside that new space of opportunity were happening and quite fast and spreading, specifically around Silicon Valley and other parts of the world as well. That essentially enabled the computer to sell peripherals like printers and many other opportunities given that configuration of the flexibility and the ability to customize a computer from software to operating systems to applications and we are not even yet considering the internet and the networked interoperable web which would come later of course as discussed.



I may also acknowledge here the notes from Andy Groove from On*Only the Paranoid Survive* about the rise of the Internet, and his views about what we're coming up at that point is very applicable to conclude this section: 

> *""* Andy Grove

With these considerations, the illustrations, give us an idea to celebrate the nature, or the phenomenon, that after space is materialized. Driven by the ties of different spaces where the sources and resources come from, it develops by its economical setting, unleashing a creative potential of collaboration that reaches a point of saturation. It follows that people ground themselves until the moment that they cannot support anymore, as if the walls are about to be broken anyway but likely by the refactoring of the underlying ties that were sustaining that world as it seemed; claiming for different choreography of these ties, enabling people to get out from that box, get out from that saturated condition, and freshly enter new worlds then to become normal builders in the eld. This could be the case, although there are many other elements there, but to name a few, that throughout the Industrial Revolution, on the rise of autonomous machines and the mechanical developments, went along with the end of slavery and the needs for more specialized automation throughout the end of the 17th century and the early 18th century.

Now if these ideas are tipping us that we shall be waiting for underlying things to happen, that isn't the case; as many as we have considered the doers in the arena, real people, are carriers of aspirations for a better future. This, we should acknowledge that the ideas for transcending comes too from within the box, exactly because we're essentially - although sometimes missing the point - interested in improving the lives of the well-beings and civilization. That idea should invite us to the means that are quite practical in the everyday life of entrepreneurs - and serve for them to improve the lives of people and come up with solutions, incremental or not, even solutions that can from within the box awake new experiences that transcends the traps they live, which usually transcend by exercising acessing the higher hopes for the human being and civilization and that does so by respecting the well-being, essentially. Let us move on into that, into transcending spaces.

## Transcending the box 





Assuming us acquainted in the environment, if not by the motion of the prior movement of entrepreneurship then by the considerations so far, we shall ask ourselves if and how can we innovate from the box - from the living space that incessantly teases us with reasons to build which may well offer unintended consequences like distractions. For that, we may now shift to moments before the action of getting things done and recognize the movement that happens to ignite them, like the one that that energizes them even to make them jump to build the bridge without noticing what they are doing. If one had the time to notice, it could come from feeling a discomfort about their situation as it is. For other, an optimistic, or a romantic aspiration for a better future. They may too live an epiphany or get involved for the sake of growing as people and a lot more. But it is undeniable that the movement sets them to figure if they should build that bridge - the why - and figure how to conduct the elements from the source - the how - in ways that produce a solution that is coherent to the destination of people - the what.

--> 



Now, if they hire themselves - if they choose to accept this mission - they will enter a holistic journey consisting of many job steps - to organize, plan, check the go-no-go, execute, and monitor how they do it - which sets them to live an experiential learning while living the hopes that their bridge can sustain itself by the movement it provokes to the environment. This necessity for sustainability is independent of their outcomes, thus it won't matter if they produce softer changes at the surface or harder ones that disrupts the core. As an example of the softer, back to the car thought initially as a means for transportation, the situation that a car can be stuck in traffic or if the location is hot or if the ride is long or the weather is cold can certainly prompt them improve the experience of drivers, to launch solutions like the air conditioner, a music player, heated seats, and more. Or they too be more oriented to the rearrangements of the means to the end, such as reinventing the methods and how to use of resources to build cars and any solutions in it such as to reduce the costs of production. As for going deeper an innovative solution to the target space may consist of removing the necessity of humans driving, with autonomous driving; and in terms of the source space could be about a new kind of engine. Now, as a consequence of the disruptive situation, the outcomes produced may actually bridge again these spaces; as an example a new engine that is advanced and (in the long run) simpler to produce may also change the experience of the drivers, like avoiding them to have to fuel their cars. 

Now one thing the world of innovation knows - that whatever it is it won't survive if the customers are not interested in using it and able to use it. While that does not give all the answrers to how to do it, it a good interesting problem to celebrate; and also a reason for us to celebrate some insights from the researchers and practitioners concerned with the challenges of innovation. A major challenge recognized by these minds has to do with the problem of listening to the people. The listening is vital, as people living experiences carries the answers, but as entrepreneurs had matured the challenge may involve not strictly listening to them as they are essentially to a certain extent like entrepreneurs living in the box and then to entangled with the existing solutions for doing things, to involved to transcend from their ways of doing, which explains that famous concern - which may or may not have said by Henri Ford - but that was formed to addres the complication that if these producers had asked to people they would have told that they wanted a faster horse [^footnote_henryford_fasterhorse]. 

[^footnote_henryford_fasterhorse]:

That faster horse is not a bad thing to want, so it may be that "these people," if they existed, were right. On another hand, assuming that producers could not produce faster horses, the challenges for addressing what to do would depend on knowing what people were trying to do with a faster horse, or to figure what people were doing it, to listen to their routines, their needs, their expectations as they were involved in their daily jobs. This is where an insightful perspective from Professor Clayton Christensen - the renowned professor from Harvard Business School and author of the book, *The Innovator's Dilemma* - came to help entrepreneurs and led practitioners to further develop structured models to help entrepreneurs to innovate forward by looking at the environment of their customers. This work is known as Jobs to Be Done which is essentially about not asking customers what they want, as solutions, and shifting the focus to understand the needs of the customers by looking what they are trying to get done. The famous illustration, given by a narrative created by professor Clayton and his colleagues, can be recounted before our further discussions: 

> *The researcher inquired further: “Tell me about a time when you were in the same situation but you didn’t buy a milk shake. What did you buy instead?” Sometimes, he learned, they bought a bagel. But bagels were too dry. Bagels with cream cheese or jam resulted in sticky fingers and gooey steering wheels. Sometimes these commuters bought a banana, but it didn’t last long enough to solve the boring-commute problem. Doughnuts didn’t carry people past the 10 am hunger attack. The milk shake, it turned out, did the job better than any of these competitors. It took people 20 minutes to suck the viscous milk shake through the thin straw, addressing the boring-commute problem. They could consume it cleanly with one hand. By 10:00, they felt less hungry than when they tried the alternatives. It didn’t matter much that it wasn’t a healthy food, because becoming healthy wasn’t essential to the job they were hiring the milk shake to do.*" (Christensen, Cook, & Hall, 2005)

One key takeaway from the milkshake business case may be the implication that the milkshake can help a different people in the same situaton - people living the need for drinking/eating while driving, thus not a specific demographic. Now if we focus in the Jobs to Be Done further, we also observe that they do their things, that they get their things done, thus that they carry answers as they carry needs; and that they are quite involved in their attempts to improve their situation, thus willing to pick solutions, or to hire solutions as the system says. As a consequence, yet another takeway, is that the listening to the collection of insights about the needs of groups with same needs may well represent the exercise of transcendence that enables entrepreneurs to come up with solutions. 

On the other hand, it is yet challenging because if we dig too far things may reach out to concerns that also transcends from beyond the things people do, as in their aspirations. As in, if we dig too much, we may go all the way to things like to live longer, to be happier, to give people means to learn better, and more. Thus, the complication for the ones interested in getting things done has too to do with finding a stable place where they are engaged as somebody into the why to do it, how to do it, and what to do it. This challenging movement can be emphasized by the words of Michael Dearing given an an interview with Reid Hoffman:

The message from Michael and the further considerations are reminders about the importance of us to be in a sweet spot - a place that is meaningful for ourselves and that serves well to the both spaces, the sourcing space and the target space of users. Yet, another reason for us to be calmer and to be reflective as we are searching, or refining, or exploring the what to do. 

Moving forward in this direction, let us consider an annecdote about how any space can connect with with far too many needs and then settle ourselves to recognize the challengs for stability as we position between the sourcing world and the target space of users.

### 1000 trips in a box 



I used to joke among friends - when we happened to be drinking and thinking that we had an insightful idea - that the best ideas would come from the shittiest places; usually followed by some of us noticing that the saddest part would be that we wouldn't remember anything the next day. This is yet another supporting point as for why the rise drinking coffee[^footnote_blitzscaling_ted_coffee] helped us to become better builder of things. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_ted_coffee]: During the Blitzscaling lecture 3 by Michael Dearing, *Blitzscaling 03: Michael Dearing on Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction* (Greylock, 2015), a student chimed in, reminding us that the rise of coffee shops throughout Europe as spaces for exchanging ideas was parallel to the growth curve of the industrial revolution. An elaboration on this observation is found in Steven Johnson's TED talk, "Where good ideas come from" (TED, 2010), where he expands about enlightened developments through Europe that went along with a society of coffee drinkers as opposed to a society of drunken people.

But if any truth exists there is a hint that it takes quite a trip to see through, to break the walls of our spaces. Thus, I invite you through a moment when I did about 1,000 trips as an "Uber driver," and a reflection about the conditions must exist for ideas to rise from the places and situations that people live. In other words, that first-hand experience is not enough, for example if one is too busy living the experiences first-hand and not able to transcend aiming for a different situattion, which can be the case when we are in a hurry which wasn't my case we will see. 

In other words, I wasn't a normal driver. In fact, no drivers should be considered as "normal drivers." That attempt - to see people in buckets such as to call them "motorista de aplicativos" as they call in Brazil - may well be one of the reasons that makes things difficult for us to see through. I would say that I wasn't following the playbook because I wasn't full time. I were doing on Fridays and I wanted to rethink my life, to understand how things worked, to make some money, to live the experience, and to be somebody. But make no mistake I saw myself as a real Uber driver whih took me to keep up and reach out to the 1,000 rides throughout 2017. Thus, as driver, I were happy to help people, being more calm in the the traffic, and connecting with people such as that day that I did an extra effort to help a lady to setup her wheelchair, or the other day which I took a pregnant woman - who was close to her due date - to the hospital. As a driver I was proud and wanted to see if I could be a 5-star driver. 

But as for the a-ha moments I had noted that it comes from everywhere - from the drivers and their experiences - while it onl rises to the surface if some extra conditions are met that set us to be open to possibility. A particular experience leading to an idea was connected with the experience of the first trip - a trip I won't forget because I felt in a calling - to fight my fears - to face the fears of driving into difficult streets, to face my fears of not being a good driver, my fears of allowing strangers in the car, and a more. One thing I recall vividly was how I felt in the end of the first day, surprised that I was alive and happy that I was happy and how excited I were to tell my parents. While I felt the fears of that first trip and the feelings of having done it nothing really came out in terms of ideas, like solutions. But it was later that the dots connected when I caught myself listening to an idea from a friend which I had encouraged to become a driver. It could be that he knew that I was an entrepreneur that took him to call me and ask if I could come up with a "simulation app" to help a new driver with their first trip. He wanted an experience where he could turn on his smartphone and where the screen would look like a real trip, where he had to pick up an imaginary passenger from a location and take her to another. I didn't do anything but the conversation became a reflection that became an article [^footnote_uber_first_trip] which went along, as I found later, with recognitions about the challenges of the first trip as told by Ed Baker, a former "Head of Product" from Uber:  

[^footnote_uber_first_trip]: Drawing from my initial Uber driving experiences, I had the opportunity to write an article and to reflect about the challenges of that first trip situation that could happen to many other drivers. Read more in Why that first Uber (driver) trip never happened. Ascent Publication. https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc

> *“For me, it was eye-opening when I did my first trip as a driver. I walked out to my car, I have done everything, I was activated. I walked out to my car [and] I walked back to my house because I got so nervous about doing that first trip.”*

So right here we might pause for a moment to consider that the problem of transcending, while it connects with what people feel when they are living the experiences first-hand, it only happens if the conditions for possibility of change are seen. Thus, this is yet a situation to support that situations of growth, or rush, or too busy, may well set us to not access these naturally unless action is taken. 

Another opportunity I came accross went beyond the boundaries of the setting given by Uber and I took further action. This one was "Uber-idle university" [^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university] and and consisted of a solution for learning while driving. Since at the time I needed to study entrepreneurship lectures, then I had the idea of replacing the normal car music with lectures. Because my phone wasn't good enough at the time to run the Uber app and audio, the solution I found was to save the lectures from Youtube as audio and download to a portable flashdrive and then to plug in the car radio. All were great for a while but not entirely working because of a few roadblocks. To make the experience better, I figured that I had to spend time to curate a list of good talks before taking the road, thus reducing the risks of too many bad lectures in a row which could make me lose the entire day. Another challenge had to do with the passengers - if they would accept - which I solved by telling them in advance that those were my "Entrepreneurship lessons in English," and that I was good to turn off. Not to my surprise, the support was great and so I was able to watch more than one hundred talks on entrepreneurship and to recognize that the moment of being an app driver was much less distracting than the being in front of the computer.    

[^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university]: The article entitled "Uber-idle University," explores how I end up exploring the time inside the car with educational content and shows  an example of the playlists I were using. Read more in https://medium.com/the-ascent/uber-idle-university-5af317b550d9


With that, we can celebrate that solutions are linked to the experiences and feelings and the needs of users which can be observed from various levels of abstraction. From those one-thousand trips, I had the chance to see basic improvements to Uber the application, like problems with their system, but also explored the experience of the conditions, such as of the new drivers living that first trip problem. And as we had seen, the other experiences that transcended the scope given initially. A reflection about this situation may also be an opportunity to recognize that beyond the conditions to access the needs of people, the initial movement to come up with a potential solution depends on something from other more significant insight which reduces the variability of what can be done - or in other words a great idea leading to a solution is one that needs to be coherently understood by the audience. 





### Searching stability in the target space 


Now the observation that we are incessantly doing it - unbundling our spaces and bundling or escaping the conditions from our ways of living and - but always joining people on the other end, is a clue that besides the favorable conditions for the movement the movement also happens by the *Given* that we are connected with others, in good or bad ways, directly or indirectly, in a world where all spaces are connected with others or given by others and by the knowing that all these spaces are changing too, perhaps transcending. As an example, I would think that was able to hack a solution for a better use my "idle moment" inside a car because I have considered that in the car I would be less subject to the distracting conditions given the habits that I had developed by using my smartphones always looking the notifications from networks and systems I had subscribed. 

<!--
@note @insight - Feat. Eugene The World The Slaves Made - There might be a valid thinking that all spaces, even the situation of oppression, may offer space for change from within by the movements of friction and interaction with the better spaces of others, and by the cracks that an oppressor system has to offer, or it may be that the oppressor system is just a box of a bundled situation of a society impacting and opressing others. @ref-id 7676-7564-8474-8384
--> 

Now and given that we will face the crowds, not matter if more or less we put a dent in the universe or bring a better cup of coffee to them, we shall embrace the complication of accessing and assessing the target space by navigating the target space in the first place. One particular problem, as we approach the *Market* if you will, starts right there from our own observation that they are a market. Thus, especially as fast movers, we are set to judge the target space by using the googgles - or the measurement systems - we made to comprehend things in the first place. In other words, although we measure things now using rich scientific systems, we are essentially subject to the scientific movement that came to explain our reality as it is, certainly a reality given by technology [^footnote_peterdrucker_science_measurements_from_technology]. 

[^footnote_peterdrucker_science_measurements_from_technology]: Peter Drucker, in *The Technological Revolution: Notes on the Relationship of Technology, Science, and Culture* and his considerations that technology comes before science - "it is technology that gives the union of the two its character; it is a coupling of science to technology, rather than a coupling of science and technology" (Drucker, P. (2011). p. 152. Routledge. Original work published 1970) - may well support us into the explaining the reality of our lives by the available scientific building blocks, which likely came after technology has changed our lives. Thus, the idea of market is a way to look at people by bucketizing them because of the effects of the technological offerings that shaped ourselves in the world, in a bucket. 

Furthermore and to add complexity to our navigation, our decisions are supported by translating data (as measured) as values, fairly to save ourselves from the trouble of using boring or complex interactions in normal and fast conversations. As an example, during a visit I made to my car's mechanic a couple years ago, I asked him about the potential rise of eletric cars in Brazil. His reasons for why it wouldn't work consisted of market-oriented reasons which sounded professional and realistic to me. 

Thus, it is fair to celebrate that if we are comfortable in expressing people needs as market needs defined by market definitions as we know it, we are not doing much different from that school from Ohio in 1828 when they put God against the locomotives - as God would more generally appear as common values of that bundled reality to secure that bundled reality as it were. In other words, the fact that we add value to navigate our decisions by using values bundled by our environment is real and can be a prime mover for fast movement in some circumstances can take us to good things in other can be a trap.  

This complication, and reason for us to be calmer when approaching our target spaces, can be celebrated together with leading practitioners of the lean movement as they recognized that a prior definition of a market - by measurements of traditional markets - can cost teams a lot, especially when they are using lean methods. In *How to Find a Market? Use Jobs-To-Be-Done as the Front End of Customer Discovery* (2021, November 4), Steve Blank and the Jobs-to-be-Done team (Tony Ulwick and Ted Thayer) had elaborated on the problem where essentially "*Lean Doesn’t Have a Market Definition Step*," a situation leading to a potential trap. To elaborate, let us start with the fact that lean methods ask us to learn from customers: 

> *"The Lean Startup methodology asks innovators to interview potential customers within their “market” to discover the customer’s unmet needs and establish a product/market fit. Given the number of interviews to get meaningful data, this can take months."* (Blank, S., 2021, November 4)

The approach sounds simple - or lean indeed - given the that these methods welcome teams to navigate and learn with real customers and implied good news that existing customers exist from within existing markets. In other words, teams are half-way there to pick customers after the given categorizations of existing markets - like demographic or a vertical or technologies - plus the fact that the market carries the pointers for where they are since people are bucketized by its terms. However, as lean invites them to "deepen their understanding of the customer," they may quickly hit a wall which in the lenses of lean is not at all a wall since lean asks them to pivoting the market or the customer needs or the value proposition. This iteration may take them into a "circular loop can cause them to churn, pivot, and fail." (Blank, S., 2021, November 4)

In other words, entrepreneurs doing lean with methods such as *Business Model Canvas*, *Customer Development*, and *Agile Engineering,* are indeed in good position to quickly check if their hypotheses are correct/incorrect inside a market. But also equally positioned to be drifting or hopping between the orbits of existing markets given that these methods don't help them to "figure out *where to start the search* for a new business." 

But another major problem also happens from the very situation are provoked to consider their entrepreneurial journey after pivoting themselves outside of their area of interests. While many of them will feel good to know that their crazy hypothesis weren't welcomed by customers - saving them from the trouble of building for no reason - a particular circumstance rises too when they find good news, when they find validation of customer's interest but then realizing that they are now invited to innovate in a domain which they have no interest. In other words, the good news is that "we can make money here" but the bad news is that all of our cofounders "don't want to work on that." 


But let us, for now, stick with the Jobs To Be Done which is.. 

> *"Rather than defining markets as existing, adjacent or new markets – or by verticals, technology, demographics, et al. all markets can be described by what job the user wants to get done"* 








<!--
@quote 
> *"These tools tell you how to rapidly find product/market fit inside a market, and how to pivot when your hypotheses are incorrect. However, they don’t help you figure out where to start the search for your new business."* (2021, November 4)

--> 





Another key takeaway of the jobs to be done, strategic and thoughtful and structured thinking of this special team, namely Ted Thayer and Tony Ulwick and their team at Strategyn, is their interest to see the fundamental aspects that brings innovation in the middle of the spaces of people, transcending to a certain extent. For instance, giving us great ideas for how to find stability in terms of the people needs. One key aspect that they bring is the idea of job steps. That's essentially, they had identified a kind of consistent characterizations of the phases that all jobs carries; that all the jobs always follow that same path, the following path:

<!--
@meta @todo 
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Space - Review job steps given by Chatgtp @meta-refid 1222-3332-2323-4445
-- >

* Defining the Job: Recognizing a need or problem.
* Searching for Solutions: Researching and exploring possible solutions.
* Selecting a Solution: Choosing the best-fit solution based on various criteria.
* Executing the Job: Using the selected product or service to accomplish the task.
* Assessing Outcomes: Evaluating the effectiveness of the solution in solving the problem.
* Post-Evaluation Adjustments: Making decisions on continuation, replacement, or adjustment based on the evaluation.

The immediate objective opportunity from that, for innovators, is that their solutions can serve the needs of one or more steps. Although from a romantic perspective an ideal solution would suggest that all the steps of a job are solved - like magic or a miracle - in the ideal world of entrepreneurship that shows a preference for getting things done, innovators seek for a sweet spot, to help the job by positioning an offering solution that may improve one or more steps. If that is enough, it won't matter. It may be that the solution improves the step for a market that is already served with other solutions like providing a non-stick spray in a world of cookers using standard pans, which precisely tackles the step of preparation in the job of cooking; or it may disrupt through steps such as if we consider the introduction of a non-stick pan to that world. 

A example that JTBD team uses for one that covers many steps is the iPod: 

A conclusion for innovators goes back to a strategy for them to be able to be somebody in the process and to come up with something that they can do it and that can sustain. The framework will give them the means to move from that initial better consideration of a market - in terms of the job - and then to see where they can do something given the various needs through the steps.

[^footnote_jtbd_tony]: JTBD (Jobs to be Done) theory, as developed by Tony Ulwick and Strategyn, presents a groundbreaking framework for innovation. Central to the framework is the notion that customers "hire" products or services to accomplish specific jobs or tasks in their lives. By understanding these jobs in detail, companies can innovate by creating offerings that precisely meet the needs of their customers. Ulwick's approach involves the understanding of the job steps and opportunities associated with a job, providing businesses with a structured process to identify and and come up with ideas to solve unmet needs or met needs in creative ways.

### Searching stability sourcing 





To approach the end of this chapter, crossing to the other side of the bridge, where we take things from, we should recognize that the bridge metaphor is wicked because of its circularity, that it takes things from the very same space that it delivers in the end. Thus, even if the spaceship brings a new form of energy from an asteroid, yet we are trapped by the fact that that it was *Made in Earth*. On the other hand, and this is the reason that we are here, is becomes strong when it set us to think through and to engage in the abstraction work where the existing resources are brought back in creative ways that changes our world. 

And before we approach, we shall, too, take the premises, not different from what we did when visiting that 'target space," with caution, when we look at customers, or users, or the environment, and the solutions, and their needs, and their jobs, and likewise, celebrate the calmness for the things in this "source space," which we may see them as resources, or measures, or methods, or tools, or investors, or building blocks, which may be, in essence, the means to an end.

But too to know that when we see things as a means to an end requires an extra caution, exactly because if building blocks for an entrepreneurial action may in a hurry inadvertently mean to appropriate these things for the sake of transforming, like taking the apples of a given tree and miss the necessity of the sustainable condition which depends from that circularity and suggests that better fruits are given when what we take comes from a mutually beneficial tree [^footnote_michaeldearing_mutually_tree], which in other words is to say that whatever we build there can and should be built values through values.

[^footnote_michaeldearing_mutually_tree]: The Mutually Beneficial Trading Tree (Harrison, G., & Grosz, F., 2021), likely co-authored by Michael Dearing from Harisson Metal, suggests that the entrepreneurial movement consists of building things by establishing a partnership with the roles that are providers of the resources.

<!--

* reference - Harrison, G., & Grosz, F. (2021). The Mutually Beneficial Trading Tree. Harrison Metal Press.
--> 




So let us proceed by following this principle, walking towards the gates and be greeted by the roles that are generally seen as investors. As an example, venture capital investors that although are characterized long after the industrial revolution, its fundamental values existed before and reveals its function of the supporting role of the entrepreneurial function. This function that didn't exist before, and got to be comfortable in welcoming the entrepreneurial strangers, giving them superpowers, is likely an evolution of the collaborative potential where humans in the control of the power, like technological power of resources to unleash work, had enlightened themselves to understand that the future consisted in surrendering control and embracing creativity. The function, therefore, is right in the middle as it enables the creative new by the release of the old, what were the fruits of its success, such as money and other resources, had to be released enabling the new to enter the space, likely in a way that they are not vanished and can be part of that future.

An early example of that relationship, from long before venture capital existed, can be observed by the particular dynamics where the Brown family from the U.S. had enlightened themselves and their wealth by partnering with the creative-destructive genius of entrepreneurs and setting themselves as self-cleaning oven [^footnote_michaeldearing_selfcleaning] as opposed to be erased from the timeline of history as Michael Dearing had elaborated in the interview given to Reid Hoffman:  

[^footnote_michaeldearing_selfcleaning]: In (2017, April 25) Michael Dearing had elegantly brought the elements of capitalism that produces new management, new entrepreneurs, and the new world, as the moment when "the creative-destructive genius of entrepreneurs" finds the "the visible hand of general management," and uses the "industrial wealth to improve civilization."

Another component that investors carry on, which exactly comes from their position between the old and the new world, is that They regulate the release of the resources - not only from their own, but of the resources that are passed by the connections that they hold. Thus, they are the function that depends on other functions and show ties with currents given by the economic, social, and cultural layers. And furthermore, this perspective or activity is perceived as the risk analysis which characterizates them which where they essentially recognize the potential, in terms of its disruptive power, its acceptance, and to consider these forces in favor, or against; therefore, essentially are concerned for the pouring of resources in ways that the new can be sustainable in the long run. As an example, if we go back to the case of Bill Gurlley of Benchmark Capital, we shall highlight his concerns and suggested strategy for an investment starting with the black cars, like limo service, instead of facing straight the traditional "yellow cab" industry. Therefore, like this case reveals, investors carry on the role of being strategic thinkers about how anything can be built in a world where it depends on the world to survive.

Now, and as confirmed by the words of Michael Dearing from Harrison Metal, that entrepreneurs are the creative-destructive minds themselves, they carry the duty to pitch these investors. Therefore, are the ones that shall start the investigation for understanding how the new can be given by the existing, by the old, and considering the entanglements with existing functions and variables, which deserves a simplification as for how to find these values of now to build the values for the future. Therefore, it wouldn't matter if it's incremental or disruptive. But it matters that whatever they're about to build sustains itself by the message that it carries, not only for the entrepreneurs and not only for the costumers, but for all the others involved such as the ones helping the system to be sustaining. These players and the society at large, because concrete things come and go, but the message is usually what we take and what defines its sustainability. Furthermore, as we will see, the message that is bundled within anything concrete, is implied in anything from a simple cup of coffee, a book, or an internet browser, or a social network. And implied with that is also an observation that, in the end, the actual people using things become are essentially the actual investors - of themselves - essentially revealing the circularity of that bridge.

#### It's just a cup of coffee 




Now, a complication as for approaching this world of "the message," goes back to that circularity and some of the elements that tease us to think generally that messages are for the customers, that messages comes after values, like a post-production effort or the wrapping paper of a gift or the decorative elements or the advertising messages that sell. But, and again if we are under the influence of a calmer state, if we concentrate in a holistic viewpoint for the message, we shall elicit the virtuous elements that lifts the mission, that mobilizes the team, that expand the connections, that builds the values; enabling the productization, distribution, and enlightening our marketing efforts. 

Starting with a simple case, if we take a cup of coffee under the fast-paced situation we shall surely get nothing from it such as if you just want to be awaken or your employer gives it to you to get back to work quick. But that experience have less to do with where we came from and where we are going, such as if you consider the experience of a coffee that was grown and roasted in near village and the message that it carried when sipping it when people talk about it.

That message, to a certain extent, was carried over to a certain extent defining Airbnb which required Airbnb to find ways for people to see other people, thus removing the barriers of fears of the modern world, or to "design for trust" as they would call. I had the opportunity to rent a family place and experienced being a host and making our place special. Airbnb platform for hostes, carried a message that guided me to do that.

In other words, that although concrete building blocks are necessary - like the necessity for grains to be planted an a mechanics in place to brewing of it - the users themselves set the message that transcends. As an example, we may celebrate how the Nespresso found a place as coffee drikers wanted to live the experience of having an expresso in their houses. Or how a sandal business of the nowadays may carry the message that is sought by people that want to build an environmentally friendly world. 









From the realm of the good things from marketing, the work of Donald Miller particularly cracks the code as for how people use things as a means to an end; and specifically how they grasp the message and buy-in to things by first watching stories in the first place. In *Building a StoryBrand: Clarifying Your Messages So Customers Will Listen*, Donald miller explains that the mechanism that make us value a great classic story is the very mechanism that we use to value anything that we choose to use, from stories or advices or methods or tools and you name it. In other words, that our decision to "hire" a solution to get a job done is a response as we get message that solves the equation where we see ourselves a protagonists in a position of a better story - comparing to where we are - given that the solution offered solves what in on our way. But even more special from the method is stories and the messages of brands need to address the problems in multiple level of abstractions where the actual problems on our ways is a link to our internal problems which are on the way of our destination we aspire, the better place we want to be. The simplified structure breakdown of Storybrand refers to these levels as External Problems, Internal Problems and Philosophical problems: 

> *"When these three levels of problems are solved in one shot, the audience experiences a sense of pleasure and relief, causing them to love the story."* (Miller, D., 2017, p. 69)

In other words, the mechanism that make us to enjoy a great classic story is the very mechanism that we use to enjoy and pick anything - from stories or advices or methods tools and you name it. Or, that our interest to "hire" solutions to get a job done is a response from when we get the message that solves the equation: if I were the protagonist to pick that solution, does that help me to solve the direct immediate problem ahead? And does that take me in the direction of solving other goals we aspire?

Another example that should be considered here is that even a book may have that kind of power, sustainable. For instance, if we consider the Harry Potter case, it's apparently for some readers, not just yet another book, but for other crowds, it might have carried on to certain other readers. Another bad is that it's not even generally perceived by crowds outside, but it was recognized by, for instance, Casper Ter Kuile in The Power of Rituals, that recognizes that Harry Potter, to a certain extent, competes with the function that in the past were provided by religion, like churches, should set an example.

Now, by having us consider this case, we may then move to the other more complex cases when actual platforms there visibly reveals the interactions with the community and the challenging considerations for these platforms to sustain themselves. In other words, this exploration expands the idea that the user is involved. In the end of the day, which is recognized by the work of Eric von Hippe in *User Innovation* [^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation_2], that the user becomes the co-creator of many platforms. In any case where the platform of the producers doesn't allow that construction, users may just take the next step themselves eventually or other producers motivated by solving the needs for these users may do so, but nevertheless, platforms may exist enabling this co-creation process as Eric has recognized.

In alignment with the thoughts from Storybrand, another enlightening development from the world of marketing is brought by the authors of Play Bigger (2016), as they elaborate the notion of *Category Design* which consists of a reframing of problems where a new narrative not only recognizes a significant problem - or a set of problems - but is brought in ways that the audience recognizes it as unique - as a category - in new ways of thinking about the problem as in to where the solution and narrative is a pathway to how the world could look like. This way of thinking help us too to understand great solutions like Uber and Apple's music player the iPod. If we go back to what *Jobs To Be Done* had given to us about the Ipod case, we may recall that it had acessed the job of listening to music but spanning through multiple job steps - not only one or other job steps within the job - such as to solve the ways to prepare, to organize, to play / execute, to monitor, and more. Thus, it is a case when a technological advancement forms a solid message to users; because we remember more clear when we "hire" a solution that solves a job by a new pathway that is much simple.

> *"A POV has to shift people’s minds so they reject an old way of thinking and come to believe in something new. It has to reach people on an emotional level. No one remembers what you say—but they remember how you made them feel. That feeling can be excitement about something that’s coming, or fear of missing out. Some of the best POVs make people think: “Oh fuck, I don’t have one of those! I have to get one of those!” To reach people’s emotions, a POV has to sound the way people talk. It has to be simple, direct, visceral. Language matters."* (Ramadan et al., 2016, p. XX)

Another key aspect, for any entrepreneurial effort that consider these ideas, is to consider how the development of a vision - for a brand and a product and the lives of the users being guided by them - may also set the team in a direction being less arbitrary and driven by these aspirations. In other words, solving the equation helps not only the world and the users and also the team to move on. Likewise, not an easy job to achive the level of clarity. 












One case to be considered goes back to case of Netscape and the rise of Mozilla project and the Firefox browser. If we recount from history, Mozilla project, the open-source code for a browser, was the response from Netscape as Microsoft had bundled its own browser in their Windows operating system - thus serving the Internet navigation needs of its users. The movement, given that Netscape were bleeding fast, was led by creative leaders that trusted that the growing open-source movement would give a new beginning for Netscape. A main challenge was the necessity of rewriting Netscape's proprietary code - which were millions of lines of code according to Code Rush documentary (Project Code Rush, 2013) - which involved doing it in ways compatible with the open-source characterizations and in ways to leverage the interaction of contributors from all over the world; essentially enabling the co-creation with the wider community. What were in front of them where well said by Jim Barksdale, the then-CEO of Netscape that supported that unbundling and re-bundling of Netscape as Mozilla:  

> *"Well, it's certainly my hope that the enormous amount of new people that no one company could afford to have working on any product, now contributing to the Netscape Navigator Communicator [Mozilla project], will make a significant difference in the improvement of the product. How that works against any competitor remains to be seen."* (Barksdale in Project Code Rush, 2013)

Now, and as history shows, from Mozilla open-source project not widely known in 1998 - except by these pioneers - to Firefox the browser reached 30% of the browser market in a decade [^footnote_firefox_peak], the journey consisted in solving a lot of challenges in order for a rich collaborative framework to thrive. One example of the many important buildin blocks were a system known as Bugzilla [^footnote_mozilla_bugzilla] which enabled contributors to report problems (bugs as they call), to discuss how to solve them, and to contribute with code solving them. Therefore, Bugzilla along with many other building blocks, like the Mozilla open-source license, represented the essential managerial work that responded to the needs of a wider community that were eager to collaborate. The impact, besides the outcomes visible at the surface, was a strong community, the Mozilla community, that grew in structured, that became a well of knowledge and value creation, which enabled the actual interactions from volunteers from all over the world that brought the outcome of "a significant difference in the improvement of the product," as Jim Barksdale expected, and a lot more. 

[^footnote_firefox_peak]: Firefox reached a peak market share of 32.21% in November 2009. For more details, see the Wikipedia article on Firefox and check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#cite_note-StatCounter-23 the referenced source. 

[^footnote_mozilla_bugzilla]: For information about Bugzilla, a web-based general-purpose bug tracker and testing tool originally developed and used by the Mozilla project, see the Wikipedia article - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugzilla.

In other words, the setting of Mozilla as an internet browser, given the open source initial movement and the wider input of a community that believed in openness, led Mozilla to grow as a strong product and to even motivate many other companies to work again in browsers. 








Another illustration for the challenges of building a platform and how serious and strategic should be the managerial work is recounted by the founders of LinkedIn. Although today it is easy to see LinkedIn as a social network for our professional identity, it wasn't entirely clear when they launched in 2003. Sure, they had a direction such as to be a social network for the professional identity, but to know the stable condition that would sustain growth for the network through value was another mather. Thus, they faced a particular challenge which is quite evident in the case of social and highly interactive platforms which is that what appears to be the shortest path to get there may not be the best strategy. Allen Blue, one of the LinkedIn cofounders, gave a great picture of that situation where Linkedin and other competitors were in a "race to scale," but one that required lots of strategic thinking. In retrospect, he suggested that some of their competitors had failed because they moved quickly to launch advanced features or to monetize while Linkedin leadership had engaged in a serious work to identify what were the main thing to focus in order for them to achieve true value of the network "before they actually had effective value to sell" (Greylock, 2015).


<!--
@quote ref 
> *"When we launched LinkedIn, within two or three months, there were three other competitive products, all of which were heading for the same space, which entered the market during that time. ... they were all tiny little companies that were trying to build product market fit. ... It's a race to scale and the reason that it actually worked out for us and it didn't work out for them is because we took this very seriously. ... [while] They moved very quickly to advanced features and they moved very quickly to 'how do I monetize this?' Without actually locking in the market share necessary to make the thing successful. So they were trying to build features on top of and try to sell the product before they actually had effective value to sell. And that meant we got to continue to concentrate on growth ... to move on"* (Allen Blue in Greylock, 2015, 9:53).

The point given is, therefore, that the exercise is challenging, especially in the beginning when the the various potentials are being considered by the community is not there yet making it real. For Allen, it was challengin that Linkedin didn't have yet a feedback loop in place exactly telling them; which required them to trust and to reflect and to think through seriously likely outside some of the basic pressures such as to make money now. Consider Allen's note their speculations about that space of a potential value - which he refers as product-market fit - given by the relationships with one of their potential customers - recruiters - but all of that provoking them to consider that something would need to be done - in their case growth across U.S. -  for that to potentially become real: 

> *"You know what, we had potential product market fit. Yeah, because we had identified, for instance, recruiters are a great example. Recruiters absolutely loved the concept of the product, but the problem is when they went and searched, the search base was too small. But the product market fit was actually there, but only with those specific people who could envision what it would be like when we had a ton of people on the network"* (Allen Blue in Greylock, 2015, 14:40).

Likewise, needless to say, they went further, they found the means, they had built the bridge across the U.S., they brought themselves to a sustainable condition where value were flowing through that bridge, adding value to more than one side, and also to the side of the investors, allowing them to continue to grow, and that linked them to transcend towards new challenges of growth in alignment with the Blitzscaling (2018) movement.
