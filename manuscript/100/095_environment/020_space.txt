Entrepreneurial function happens when its actions improves a situation where people interact or live or do the things they need to do. What it creates - by its solutions like tools or offerings - essentially does two things: It may improve the situation, when it adds something like when a new air conditioning is proposed to improve the air quality in a coffee shop. Or, on the other hand, it may propose a reinvention to a given arrangement or what entrepreneurs refer as to "put a dent in the universe," where as an example we can recall the ideas presented by the founders of Uber where they informed their investors of a complication with the current cab situation referring as taxi-monopolies even to a point of pointing out "the medallion system" (2017, August 23) as one of the factors reducing the quality of the service.

In other words, these founders had envisioned some freedom or a better experience certainly in their views which consisted in a rearrangement of an experience, essentially changing a space or a market depending how you want to see. And since we aren't judging the creations but recognizing a way to look at these environment. If we think of it as a space, we may think of the limits like  boundaries or constraints; and certainly from that the opportunities. This space, like a box, recognizes some inputs, such as to note the ground that a farmer uses to plant seeds, and also the outputs, such as that fruits can be sold to a local community. Or if another team had an idea to help people sleep, they can be grounded by a platform - like the Android platform - where they expect to deliver the experience as a smartphone "app" available to potential users through the Google marketplace, Google Play. 

When we consider so different examples, we may think first that it takes a very specific reason for some people to want to mess up with their environment. Sometimes we will just don't get it how certain people create certain things. I felt at simes a feeling of judging some of the solutions, like to think how ridiculous is it for someone to be paying for a moment of silence. But now there are a lot of digital services that guide us into an experience that may have to do in a way or another with a moment of silence. Now it can be normal when you see a person that has subscribed to "an app" that helps her to have a moment of meditation. Perhaps a monk won't get it, not entirelly, although it is likely the monk is better equipped to understand the situation. But if you take a time machine and bring someone from 1885 living near a water mine, that person would not get why to pay for a cup, or a bottle or too a box of water. I still remember the yuck face my friend did around 2005 when I told him that supermarkets in the US had egg yolks in a box. 

It is unescapable for many of us to first think that all that is being offered are by-products of the situation of abundance brought by the capitalist machine that is non-stop evolving and serving the needs of people in a world that is spinning faster. As an example, when I first heard about those hydration gels that a runner drinks during a marathon, I thought it were some sort of compact water, to avoid the water to be bouncing inside the belly. Then I did a bit of research when editing this and realized that it has less to do with water and it's a source of energy that is easy to consume, that it offers fast absortion, nutrients, and as well may bring some of the values from like the electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, that are lost through sweat. So my case helps us to conclude that it may be indeed that the capitalist machine is thirsty for creating all sorts of solutions and, as well, that many people just don't get it because they are not actually wearing the shoes of the ones living specific needs.

One thing to take from all that is that it turns out that we sort of seem to be living our lives and needs and running our lives on top of platform. Thus, if one lives a crazy work life she might find herself in needs for balancing out things; and it may be that she is too busy looking to the mobile screen too so for her it could make sense to install a digital application on her mobile device, one that helps her to meet other walkers since she prefers to not walk alone. And the application has other bells and whistles too like it saves the path for all her walks, it reports the total of footsteps per walk, it monitors her heart rate, and it may too give her badges, and it may too allow her to share and celebrate in the digital space with her network her achievements - yay. 

So I hope that some of these illustrations are good for the many us that are the people that just don't get it. With that said, and yet or still, it may be so that we feel sometimes that many of these solutions are unecessary, or too much. Thus, it is unescapable too that sometimes we think of ourselves and others as victims of some experiences and to be concerned with, as if that we sometimes are in a enprisioned. These days I was concerned since I got a picture of my nieces visiting the country land: They were in a playground sat in opposite sides of the merry-go-round spinner, a mechanical equipment where kids sat around and can spin theselves by applying their force in a central plate that does not move. So they would spin fast except that both of them were watching a video on their tablet. To be fair with them, I got a photo, so maybe they were resting after having played too much, although that resting watching a tablet is yet something that concerns me.

* Outline - Complication - Entrepreneurship can be trapped in the space.  
--> 







So, a complication to be considered from this situation is that entrepreneurial action can emerge from every single space, especially under the conditions when there are people doing things and interacting and giving spaces, and there are their needs that they are trying to solve for their lives, and when these entrepreneurs care about changing and giving them a better life. In other words, if entrepreneurial action may happen in every single space that people live, when these fellow entrepreneurs care and thus feel that they can do something, then they then become somebody empowered and able to propose changes to those spaces. But then from that it also comes the dilemma that entrepreneurs might not even see that indeed they are able to improve certain spaces and improve the lives of the ones in there, but they too can be trapped within certain boundaries of the spaces, or to be thinking inside the box in a way. Therefore, the level of access in terms of challenging the boundaries of the spaces can be relative, and this relativeness, depending on the industries and the culture and circumstances, can also become trapped for entrepreneurs. As an example, an entrepreneur might be trying to improve the engine of a car, and from another perspective some others may try to rethink the entire necessity for using cars. To point how this concern is expressed, consider the concerns from Sam Altman in his article where he is worried about the voices or the lack of voices in Silicon Valley that could put in risk the innovation potential.

> *"More recently, I’ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for intelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension leave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so toxic. “If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical” was a memorable quote I heard this year."* Sam Altman, https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

He also had considered: 

> *"Political correctness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage."* Sam Altman,  https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

With the intention of allowing us to move ahead with this theme and the concerns about us entrepreneurs being trapped within boundaries, sometimes not being able to see the transformations that are imminent or the possibilities, I will call this attempt to materialize the idea of a space. So think that this is the space where opportunity may happen. The idea of this space involves limits or boundaries, and if you're indeed thinking inside the box, and if this space is where people live and do things, it is then the space where you can propose changes, although in general changes are proposed within the space exactly because it is a space of interaction, where people are generally respecting each other or in a way playing by the rules. And exactly by considering the perspective of the limits and the actual metaphorical reference that any space of unlimited space or that certain rules are applying, we may then find ourselves invited to the very considerations when the space can be reconsidered, where the limits or the boundaries of a given reality can be reconsidered, which is also part of what entrepreneurial action does. And in matter of fact, real entrepreneurial action or more innovative the solution is, the more impactful the solution is, it is likely one that rethinks these boundaries and limits of a given space, and by rethinking it creates a new reality, which usually has ties with the development of a whole economy, and by creating a new economic model, these spaces impact social and cultural aspects, therefore creating a new space of opportunity. That essentially may touch the subject of creative destruction, if we think in more macro terms. But this idea may be applicable at any level in general, and if we are to follow on that, I would like to also bring about some considerations from the idea of bundle and non-bundle, which is essentially what entrepreneurial action does when one is in front of the consideration of the entrepreneurial opportunities in spaces.

The concern from Sam Altman is indeed one of a kind - even many entrepreneurs would think - since he using an extremme example of innovative work that reaches out the limits of our space as we know it. But his concern is clearly stated - how many factors in a given environment may create certain limits to what is possible, even in Silicon Valley. 

To be concerned with that may mean to be facing a dilemma that entrepreneurs may face although many of them may not even notice. That they do seek to do something, to be somebody, to change their spaces. But then they too may be trapped within certain limits, and may not even be interested in rethinking how relative is the space they live; as they can be comfortable and assume that a given reality is stable. If we were to use a simple physical metaphor, some of them may improve their space by painting the walls, some others propose new kinds of lights, and others may rethink the ways for living but yet within the space, accepting the limits and the boundaries of that space - economic, social, cultural. With that, we too may miss the possibilities of reconsidering the space as it is assumed to be. In other words, to be breaking the wall.

To shift away from the far example of rethinking life, and to consider the boundaries, consider how many entrepreneurs are busy writing applications for the Android platform, like games. For these, they might be operating under the limits of the space as they know - the limits of mobile phones available in the market, the limits - defined by the technological allowances and policies - imposed by Google Play marketplace, to name some limits. Yes, a lot can be done there but too yes to the idea that they have to, to a certain extent, accept the rules of the platform.

* @outline - Answer - has to do with the notion of bundle and unbundle - for the spaces
--> 


If we focus on innovation, and the notion that entrepreneurs are essentially trying to create value for people in a way or another, then it comes the question of the space which they want to change something? When I call space, I am suggesting that there are boundaries or limits, so the metaphor recognizes the aspect of innovation tha tmay involve breaking existing rules but too on the other hand that any innovative setting will be grounded somewhere, will essentially abide to rules of another space. 

As an example, we can go back to the days when the first GPS-ready smartphones gave ideas to entrepreneurs to to improve or rethink the ride-hailing experience. Some of them played nice with the rules of the standard cabs industry like the yellow cabs in New York. The ones that went in this direction had proposed a better experience for existing cab drivers such as ride enabling a ride hailing from a mobile phone, checking the cost, and more. On the other hand, others having considered the possibilities of people using connected smartphones, didn't feel limited by the main constraints of the existing cab industry. In other words, they had just unbundled the existing cab space as it was seen. If we look at the original business presentation from Uber - Uber's original pitch deck (2017, August 23) - from 2008, we'll see how the founders proposed a new experience totally different from the known experience and also how they recognized that the old experience had ties with the existing taxi monopolies. In other words, they reinvented the ride-hailing experience. To note, a core aspect of the experience involved calling a ride from the smartphone without the need for traditonal phone calls, which was an exciting unseen experience for most people since the Iphone was launched in 2007, which also explains why it was thought to be first available in San Francisco and limited for executives where they could get rides in better cars, like Mercedes. Yet, the presentation had clearly considered the scenario of expansion that would affect the traditional cab space. The rest is history and we now know that Uber had indeed changed this space.

So when we think of this situations of entrepreneurship and innovation happening in a given space - improving it or reconsidering it - we are inviting ourselves to reflect too about how these spaces are formed - such as technology-based platforms - and how the new configuration may change the prior economic situation of a given space like what Uber did by pushing the category further. From the business perspective, this idea was considered in a famous line from Jim Barksdale from the days when he was the CEO of Netscape [^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]. 

In an interview for Justin Fox, for Harvard Business Review (Fox, 2014), Jim Barksdale recalled line came about during Netscape's public offering roadshow. Jim and his team were at the Savoy Hotel in London, pressed for time and facing a room full of British investment bankers. When questioned about Microsoft's potential to bundle a browser into their product - “How do you know that Microsoft isn’t just going to bundle a browser into their product?” - he made a statement for how an innovative competitor product were essentially consist the destrution of the values of its competition and by that it would ground itself as new values: "Gentlemen, there’s only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling," and followed by "Well, best I can tell, most people spend half their time adding and other people spend half their time subtracting, so that’s what works out, " so satisfy the needs of an audience that were puzzled but curious. 

According to Jim, although the comment wasn't carefully crafted, it was intuitive and captured the truth that innovations essentially deals with adding and subtracting elements of a given value proposition. Again you can improve a car or you can rethink the car's necessity too. Back to the Uber proposition, the expansion scenario did happen and they had enabled in many cities in the world the ability for basically any driver to become an Uber driver and to even work when they wanted. So what Uber end up enabling didn't only reinvent the space of traitional cab drivers as it were but also it didn't ask for permissions to turn on a common driver to become a professional; it did it without owning any car, without hiring the actual drivers as the Uber model was designed to be more like a marketplace where the driver would be using the online services. This level of unbundling would be then access many other spaces such as the space of the laws of government. 

[^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]: The idea of bundle and unbundle is generally promoted by Marc Andreessen, one of the creators of the first popular internet browser that co-founder of Netscape. Marc is a well-known investor and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, A16z, an iconic venture capital firm from Silicon Valley.

As we explore the spaces that entrepreneurship acts, either to support or enhance or either to rethink the space, let us go through an illustration and considerations using the history of Silicon Valley to explore how these spaces are formed and how a space can too be nested inside another space - an exercise that will help us see that platforms as spaces, and how platforms may depend on other platforms too. Following, let us consider that within certain platforms the users are doing things, solving their needs, so we will reflect on the relationship with the user that actss in a space and how innovation rises from within, as users seek improvements to what they do if not freedom from the situation they seem themselves. And finally, we will close this section with a reflection and conclusion about other forces that will support/prevent us from exploring the opportunities and a conclusion about who owns the space or the truth.

### Bundling the space 

As we have seen from the ideas of Jim Barksdale, the notions of bundling and unbundling have to do with additions on top of space or deconstructing a given space. And when deconstruction happens successfully, it happens as well that new spaces are bundled. So before we get to that and the entrepreneurs' motivations and considerations for modifying these things, I would like to invite us in this section to an exploration based on the digital space and digital platforms that take us to reflect about how spaces are created, specifically how platforms are created, which also will give us the idea that in the networking and digital economy, many of the things that we see that seem to be real are as well considered to be relative.

The reason that this matter to us is that if all spaces works like the ground for any groundwork - like the ground where a farmer plants a seed and grow an apple tree - then the understanding of its relativeness allow us to respect or celebrate that someone, or something, has control of the space and with that we invited to consider that what entrepreneurs do can indeed play by the rules of a given space or to deny the rules of it. In the farmer illustration this would be about saying that someone controls the weather or the ground conditions or the quality of the water. But of course, it will be easier for us to consider the relativenes of spaces if we consider the spaces that people have created in the first place instead to wonder about what controls the weather. So let us consider the rise of digital platforms and how the computer revolution had brought to us many opportunities. 






I invite you to follow with me and the story of how I came to enjoy working with digital platforms - such as to make computer animations or software - from the early days. But more than just enjoying, and becoming somebody in the world of the digital creations, the opportunity I had was to see how platforms were formed and how platforms exists because they seat on top of others. In other worlds, when I see a digital system, like a mobile phone, I generally see a bit more, I see that whatever "app" is running is running "on top" of a platform, like the Android, and I also see that Android sits on top of what a software engineer would call an systems architecture that depends on many systems and projects of others, and then all of that "seats on top" of a hardware platform too and we could go all the way to the transistors. S

o because all of that can be complicated - if not boring for a business book - I thought of giving us a viewpoint for how I had witnessed the formation of digital platforms, from the age of 10 around 1985 and up to now, so witnessing the first video games, the early personal computers, then the emergence of the Internet browser, then witnessing the early mobile phones and up to now when I have a quite powerful smartphone that receives too many notifications to the point that I had to install "an app" referred as a digital well-being app that allows me to turn off many of the online apps too when I have to do focused work like what I am doing now. 

The origin of seeing things as platforms, or spaces, started to grow from around 1985. These where the days when video games existed already so it was exciting to be growing around these systems. But generally with video games it was sad that we had no way to create those games, or to modify them ourselves. One could only dream and wonder about how these games were made, of course excited about the possibilities of modifying it - What if I could change the clothes of the hero? Of what if I could change the color of the background, or the number of lives, and more. But it didn't take long before my father brought the personal computer. This was a different box because it also had games in it but it had something else which was a more acessible door inviting us to do that kind of custom work. That was the message. You can use the same machine to actually write new things that runs in the machine. And a kid would naturally ask - can all be done from that? And the answer was yes, one could engage and create software systems, and even other video games. 

So the first thing to learn was what the technical folks would call *The Operating System* and too other esential tool referred as *The Programming Language*. With a programming language you can write your own game. So I took that as the truth which made me assume that the computer I had was a thing that enabled the development of games. Since my goal was to build my own game I tried. But it didn't take long for me to start to understand that the programming language that I were using was too simple or limited. So my game seemed to be impossible with the platform I were using. The solution I heard was that I had to write games in a more complex programming language what the technical folks refer as *The Machine Language*. Needless to say that I had no pointers like access to the Internet. The books we had were magazines and I likely didn't express to my parents my intents to dive into that level of detail. So, I had decided to pivot since I were anxious for results and tried to do something more simple. Also time were moving and I would be by now using a better computer. Since I liked to draw I tried to make a software for drawing what the technical folks would refer as a graphics editor. Although that seemed simpler comparing with video games, and I went quite further, I caught myself again limited by the tools I were using or limited by the complex thinking involved to make that work with the limited resources too. Since I couldn't really make that graphics software how I wanted I endup feeling like being somebody usefaul writing software solutions for the world of adults, what technical folks refer as commercial systems. Those were simple, I felt as somebody useful and could even help some adults too. It was exciting and this is how I came to understand that systems for people, or what technical folks would refer as users, were written using programming languages, the things that developers could write games, or graphic editors, or word processors and commercial applications. 

So right there I would be an user experiencing a number of platforms. To consider the evident ones, first the computer itself. And "on top of that," as the technical professional would say, there is an operating system. And on top of that operating system, the tools for programming. Another evident observation is how I were able to do things, like to write my own software system, but too had to respect the limits of these platforms, to use the tools that they had offered. 

Now, having us followed the story of a kid growing around computers, and a bit from the world of computers, and the information technology industry growing up to the point of the Internet and browsers, we will we shouldn't miss the phenomenon that all of these became possible because of the economic opportunity that went along. If we fast-foward to near the end of 2000, we will find that this kid happened to be becoming a professional in a space that was new but promissing. In other words, the world of the browser, and its tools and related underlying systems, was becoming as the web was evolving the economy. 

Consider a role position that didn't exist - the role of the Web developer [^footnote_marcio_web_developer] - that went along with the evolution of the browsers, the internet. But along with the fact that being able to work as a web developer was more and more real; it was as real as well how that space seemed immutable in a way. In mean, while we can easily see in retrospect how the browsers and the internet changed fast, at the time it felt in a way that walls existed and were real; with its own rules and specific details governing what we as web developers were able to do. In other words, the building blocks we had were given and changing all the time but yet one busy as a web developer wouldn't have any time to even consider the relativeness of all. 

[^footnote_marcio_web_developer]: The web developer, formed after the Internet browser enabled organizations to make sites and software systems available through web browsers. The web developer would then become a worker for the medium of the Web. https://hackernoon.com/the-history-of-web-developers-tied-to-browser-development

Thus it comes with that too, that even in the digital space, we shall be set under conditions that can be quite difficult to see the miracle of how these tools and systems and arrangements are formed and how one thing depend on another on so many levels of abstractions, especially when we are busy and producing. Perhaps, we get a bit of that feeling that something else exists when out of the sudden we get to be disconnected; in my case when it was a day when the electricity went off out of the sudden. More younger ones would recall the same feeling if the Internet went off - it is then when some infrastructure that we take for granted is taken out that we in fact almost get interested in celebrating how far too many things are interconnected. Let's extend this idea a bit further with Maslow from *Memorandum on Syndrome Dynamics and Holistic, Organismic Thinking*, an strange title perhaps but as strange as us taking for granted all that makes any of these spaces possible: 

> *"The fact is that the enterprise, let's say Non-Linear Systems, is embedded in its immediate community; in all sorts of specifiable ways this immediate community is embedded in the larger community, let's say the Southern California area, which in turn has very definite and functional relationships with the state of California, which in turn is embedded in the United States, which in turn is embedded in the Western world, which in turn is embedded in the whole darn human species and the whole darn world. There are functional relationships in the sense that demonstrable causes and effects can be listed, and they can be listed by the thousands. The fact that these are normally overlooked and taken for granted has nothing to do with the case. For instance, the fact that Non-Linear Systems has just one night watchman instead of a private army of three thousand people equipped with machine guns and cannon is taken for granted, but this can be taken for granted only when the relationships work so well. Or the fact that the enterprise is dependent upon the town for the supplies of water, electricity, and gas, for the maintenance of roads, for fire and police departments, not to mention doses of other services like restaurants and shopping centers and markets and the like, which make it possible for people to live in the area, which makes it possible in turn for them to work in the plant. If anybody who worked at non-linear systems took a risk of being assassinated on the main street, then the enterprise would, of course, disappear. This should be spelled out; it should be consciously understood that Non-Linear Systems rests on a whole network of assumed relationships, services, etc. It is, in a word, "contained within" as in a syndrome, or even more accurately it is "contained-and-structured within."* (Maslow, p. 135)

To take a dive into this interconnected world, let us consider the underlying core element that made computers, the microprocessors, which we can see with our naked eye. But if we dig within the microprocessor, if one could see, we should reach out to the transistors which are semiconductor devices, which are essentially tiny switches that can either allow or not allow energy to flow depending on a signal. An exampe of a big switch would be a door of a house which would allow a human to go out, if the door is open, so then once out she could give out information. Now the magic in the computer world happens because the transistor is a tiny switch that can be arranged with others. This arrangement is the microprocessor, like a big house with many little doors enabling information to pass depending on energy signals given. To give a ballpark figure comparing the evolution of these microprocessors, the then-popular personal computer known as the IBM PC from 1981, which was a significant point in the computing history, carried an Intel microprocessor that had about 29,000 transistors [^footnote_history_transistor_count]. Fast-forward 39 years, the Apple Iphone 12 powered by Apple's A14 Bionic microprocessor carries around 11.8 billion transistors. In other words, in terms of transistors, an Iphone 12 microprocessor had 406,000 times the amount of transistors of an IBM-PC from 1981; which help us to understand why we can use an Iphone to do so many things even to subscribe to an app to help us to sleep. We should remind ourselves as well that the size of the transistors became much smaller which is one of other many factors of the technological revolution with transistors.  

[^footnote_history_transistor_count]: As noted in the Wikipedia article "Transistor count" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count), estimates are provided for the transistor count of the Intel 8086 chip and the 8088 chip used in the IBM PC.

Since obviously our idea is not to get technical but to celebrate the relativeness between these spaces, let's shift our focus to the history of Silicon Valley, back to 1956 when Shockley Semiconductor were founded by the co-inventor of the transistor in the beautiful Santa Clara Valley - a region of California known at the time for an agriculture producing orchards, apricots, prunes, cherries, plums, and more. I have used an AI tool to doublecheck information about William Shockley by asking "Was Shockley that went to live in the bay area with his mother?," to which the tool replied: 

> *"Yes, William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor and Nobel Prize laureate, moved to the Bay Area, specifically Mountain View, California, in 1956 to be closer to his ailing mother. This move was significant because it led to the establishment of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, the first semiconductor company in the place that would be later known as Silicon Valley. Shockley's decision to relocate there and start his semiconductor company played a crucial role in the development of Silicon Valley as a major hub for high-tech innovation and development."* ChatGPT, 2024. 

As an aside, the transistors made by Shockley Semiconductor were made of Germaniun, while later Silicon became a more suitable  material for transistors; which explains why we call it Silicon Valley and not Germanium Valley. Another aside that I don't want to check the accuracy comes from when I first visited the Netscape campus back in 2000 and driving around the parking lot I asked my manager "what is that interesting object that looks like a little lighthouse?" To which he said that it was a super fan probably pulling chemicals from the ground and dumping far away in the air. I don't know if he was joking or not but I was scared and wondered about how things were before our days - the browser days. Now I remember too that from time to time a very shiny - and likely expensive equipment - would appear at different locations in our building. They told me that those were there to measure the quality of the air. 

Now if we consider some of the transformations from 1956 - the Shockley days - to 1981 when Intel were unbundling their own 8086 platform architecture and bundling Intel's next generation of microprocessors, we will see it too how these technological developments went along with the needs for new management perspectives. From the founding of Intel to backwards, we can track that Intel were founded by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore. And if we rewiend more, we'll find that these same individuals happened to be part of a team of founders known at the time as *The Traitorous Eight* [^footnote_trairorous_eight] - a group of colleagues from Shockley Semiconductor that left and had founded Fairchild Semiconductor. 

[^footnote_trairorous_eight]: The "Traitorous Eight" refers to the eight engineers and scientists who left Shockley Semiconductor due to dissatisfaction with management. They were Gordon Moore, C. Sheldon Roberts, Eugene Kleiner, Robert Noyce, Victor Grinich, Julius Blank, Jean Hoerni and Jay Last; and founded Fairchild Semiconductor; which opens our minds to consider how the idea of leaving a company, and with it its management practices and culture, were connected to the needs of a market in development. 

The history around the *Traitorous Eight* is an invitation for a reflection for how the bundling of a new technological opportunity may depend on unbundling other fundamental elements in the space of management and even culture: While William-Shockley-the-inventor was brilliant the William-Shockley-the-manager was considered to be terrible by colleagues which prevented the opportunity ahead and led these eight colleagues to leave Shockley to create Fairchild Semiconductor. And if you are reading this wondering "what a big deal to leave bad management" keep in mind that in 1957 the idea of an employee leaving a company were considered as wrong - very wrong - which led Shockley to describe their leaving as a betrayal (Wikipedia, 2024).

Now, allow me to see all of these companies as like departments of a one big company. With that, we can then proceed to think that Shockley had produced Fairchild. As as seen, that Fairchild brought Intel. But not only Intel, as according to *Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley* (2016, December 20), Intel was one of other 126 spin-off companies also known as Fairchildren.

--> 

Now let's consider the possibility that the *Traitorous Eight* - as an event up to the point that Shockley having accused them of being traitors - could have accelerated a process waiting to happen: that it produced an impact in the views especially in Silicon Valley, minimally and initially to the people working at Fairchild Semiconductor, producing more open views such as for leaving a company, such as in circumstances of bad management. It is expected too that Fairchild had a better management and as well that its employees would not not fear much to consider creating new companies where many of them may be amond the 126 spin-off Fairchildren [^footnote_fairchild] companies. This event and managerial movements would likely produce a shift in the culture of the people working in Silicon Valley not only in terms of needs for better management but producing a mindset for openness which were essential elements a development of that industry and technological revolution. 

[^footnote_fairchild]: According to Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley Fairchild Genealogy (2016, December 20), a published print known as Fairchild Genealogy chart from 1986 included 126 semiconductor companies that were traced directly to Fairchild.

And if we keep forwarding the Silicon Valley movie all the way to Intel days yet focusing on the managerial perspective, we get to celebrate the writings of Andy Grove, Intel's first hire that later became CEO and the author of the influencial management book entitled High Output Management. While High Output Management has produced direct impact to a lot of other innovators in Silicon Valley and around the world, is it too the historical proof of the managerial transformation and how quick these new managers had to do something about it. To note, Andy Grove wrote High Output Management and Only the Paranoid Survive while working at Intel. 

<!--

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Environment, Space - Check reference if Andy Grove were really first hire. @meta-refid 1212-2223-3392-9394
--> 



As a matter of fact, the very new management practices that Andy Grove were involved with for many years during the challenging days of Intel led Intel to enter a new space of opportunity, leaving Intel as a memory manufacturing company, becoming Intel, which became widely known as the microprocessor manufacturing company and the realizations of the new space of opportunity since the microprocessors were becoming the central element of enabling value in the face of the emerging and growing needs and access of personal computers by people. Which takes us to understand the realization that Andy Grove had that the configuration of the personal computers inside small businesses and homes of people and all sorts of different businesses were actually becoming a central platform where all sorts of values would be able to be added on top or inside that space by all sorts of companies. Therefore, the fruition by the creative potential of many other entrepreneurs that wanted to contribute inside that new space of opportunity were happening and quite fast and spreading, specifically around Silicon Valley and other parts of the world as well. That essentially enabled the computer to sell peripherals like printers and many other opportunities given that configuration of the flexibility and the ability to customize a computer from software to operating systems to applications and we are not even yet considering the internet and the networked interoperable web which would come later of course as discussed.


And again, and likewise, celebrating the nature of the phenomenon where the space is materialized in the whole new economical setting, where creative potential is exercised and opportunities arises, it follows that people ground themselves for a while. Of course, until this environment can't hold anymore, like this space is saturated and people are unhappy and want to improve again. But nevertheless, as fruition happens, and collaboration, and personal relationships and life have acquired a new level of interaction, it all happens by establishing harmonious interactions in that given space. But with that as well, the very idea of the space being great, as a reality, will be challenged when that space is not enough, and there are new expectations from whoever can see a future, a better future, a different future. And it may be so that other forces may also conspire to reinvent this space or to collaborate exactly because saturation of that economic model has reached it. Exactly because the interactions among people are seeking for new harmonious ways of operating. That's when we get the demand for reinvention, and it may be so that we find the phenomenon of creative destruction, such as what happened to the Industrial Revolution, as the rise of the mechanical and autonomous systems went along with the end of slavery and the needs for more specialized automation throughout the end of 17th century and the early 18th century. And again, and of course, that produced a new world, but also with that a new space and the reasons for us to challenge the new space and to continue to motivate the next generation to understand that, we shall then be concerned with the very situation when we are confidently trapped doing our entrepreneurial action within the space, not considering at all the points about the subtraction or deconstruction of the various spaces that we have in front of us. In other words, we're essentially celebrating how it is to be trapped in that given space and that sometimes we so feverishly react. 




But then, again, when the new platform comes our way, then we are well used to all of that, victim of all of that too, conforming with the rules again. But once a network becomes an ecosystem, then it boosts people to run interactions that are supportive of an economy, doesn't it? Consider any network, such as Craigslist, or even Facebook. 

Conclude with the bundle and unbundling challenge?

### Unbundling the space

It's certainly so that any innovative idea consists of supporting people that are living in a given space. Or in other words, that the space has offered an opportunity for the improvement of life for a number of people in that space. It follows from that that the entrepreneurial action, willing to innovate, comes from a certain level of discomfort, or from the optimist perspective that is driven by the future better comfortable conditions. And in more extreme cases, the innovative ideas that may as well suggest the subtraction of characteristics of a given space, with that the unbundling idea may have to do with the intentions of freeing people that might be imprisoned.

So, if the essential search and quest of the entrepreneur is to seek creating and delivering innovation in a given space, then the question is really of, inevitably, they are going to have to be concerned with the understanding of the space where they are considering the opportunities. So, since the entrepreneur might not understand if the space is interpreted correctly, they might, anyway, get involved with the attempt to improve any situation that they see within the space. So we may, for example, assume that a given space is actually a car, and if we think about right now, if a car is stuck in traffic somewhere in the world, it certainly brings me to celebrate the existence of some of the innovative offering solutions that modern cars have, such as if location is hot, the car has an air conditioning, and also the car has a music player, and comfortable seats as well.

These are things that makes the experience of being stuck to be much better. Celebrating a nice car - and its whistles and bells - stuck in the traffic should also set us to celebrate the cup holder, which would well accomodate a milkshake. And if the driver is a business manager he will may be interested to recall the reflections from Clayton Christensen, the renowned Harvard Business School professor also known for the book *The Innovator's Dilemma*, that had developed the beginnings of the idea that we essentially hire products to do a job for us, that we are essentially seeking for solutions to help our ways to get a job done. Consider the narrative given by professor Clayton and his colleagues, where a researcher interviews commuters and understands better the intents of some commuters for when they bring milkshake to their cars: 

> *The researcher inquired further: “Tell me about a time when you were in the same situation but you didn’t buy a milk shake. What did you buy instead?” Sometimes, he learned, they bought a bagel. But bagels were too dry. Bagels with cream cheese or jam resulted in sticky fingers and gooey steering wheels. Sometimes these commuters bought a banana, but it didn’t last long enough to solve the boring-commute problem. Doughnuts didn’t carry people past the 10 am hunger attack. The milk shake, it turned out, did the job better than any of these competitors. It took people 20 minutes to suck the viscous milk shake through the thin straw, addressing the boring-commute problem. They could consume it cleanly with one hand. By 10:00, they felt less hungry than when they tried the alternatives. It didn’t matter much that it wasn’t a healthy food, because becoming healthy wasn’t essential to the job they were hiring the milk shake to do.*" (Christensen, Cook, & Hall, 2005)

So indeed there are things we do hire to get a job done, and it makes a lot of sense; and I recommend quite well for all entrepreneurs to dig into the Job To Be Done theory, especially the work of Jobs to Be Done Tony Ulwick [^footnote_jtbd_tony] and his colleagues; but too it comes with that that there are levels, or zoom levels for the situation of our lives. You can indeed improve the car for the situations of a jam or boring or long rides, the car folks are doing a good job there. 

But too it comes the undeniable thinking that sometimes crosses our minds - do I need the car? What happens, when we do that, is not that we are essentially giving up the Jobs To be Done theory but in fact we might be fully embracing and recognizing that there are levels that you can focus to consider/reconsider what happens in a space.

[^footnote_jtbd_tony]: JTBD (Jobs to be Done) theory, as developed by Tony Ulwick and Strategyn, presents a groundbreaking framework for innovation. Central to the framework is the notion that customers "hire" products or services to accomplish specific jobs or tasks in their lives. By understanding these jobs in detail, companies can innovate by creating offerings that precisely meet the needs of their customers. Ulwick's approach involves the understanding of the job steps and opportunities associated with a job, providing businesses with a structured process to identify and and come up with ideas to solve unmet needs or met needs in creative ways.

* @outline - a2 - Marcio's reflection about being an Uber Driver  
--> 



We if look at the situation with Uber' story, I was a driver for 1000 trips. Perhaps as I was a part-time driver, not being 100% inside at it, I could bend its reality, a little and in my own way, very softly. I started doing on Fridays, and first my goal was to understand the rules "of the game" how the network works, thus I could exercise the idea of being somebody there, as a driver. I had to fight my fears, to put my mother's car in the streets, and my own fears such as driving into difficult streets, not being a good driver, and a lot more. When I came back that first day, I vividly remember, I sat on the couch but on it's arm with my feet on the couch, happy, telling my parents. Later happy for being a 5-star driver, or 4.9 one. Thus a lot of elements where in there, creating a platform for myself, to be someone, to make money too, where I could use some skills, could go towards been better as a driver, as a person, and get grades, and model my profile. End up with 1000 trips, good memories, and great stories too. 

One of the them was when I took a pregnant woman - she said it was close, last that was false alarm, when she was with her sister. This time, again, she was alone. I asked her - should I pass the red lights? She said no, please don't. Later I told her that we were next to the hospital X, Beneficiência Portuguesa, and she got scared and screamed "No, wrong hospital" to which I figured I confused the name and told here we were are going to the correct destination, and then she arrived safely. 

So I was there, also helping people, therefore not likely in a condition of urgency that would set me to perform in certain metrics, such as performance for money, which gave me experiences, to first see things that could be improved on top of the platform. That reflection was likely related to checking the limits of the bundled reality, like semi-unbundling, the sort of activities that users do, such as lead users [^footnote_lead_users] for when they are in it not trying to unbundle all but intended to support what is bundled, to evolve it. That sort of exposue can take some users to be considered as special, since they co-create the future of platforms, or can even give people jobs too. 

[^footnote_lead_users]: 

The situation I reflected was of the problems of the first trip, which involved the recognition of the fears that I went through, so I have envisioned that Uber could do a lot better to help one driver to reduce its fears. After the feelings of fears, the struggles, I caught myself later receiving an idea from a friend that became a driver. Since he knew that I was an entrepreneur, he called me asking me to make a simulation app for a first Uber trip — one that could create a fictitious trip in the streets. As I reflected about the aspects that apps could teach us in simulated environment [^footnote_uber_first_trip], it was interesting to the recognition of the problem by Ed Baker, a former Head of Product and VP of Growth at Uber: 

[^footnote_uber_first_trip]: https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc 

> *“For me, it was eye-opening when I did my first trip as a driver. I walked out to my car, I have done everything, I was activated. I walked out to my car [and] I walked back to my house because I got so nervous about doing that first trip.”*

Another sort of opportunity I crossed, although it seemed a bit outside the boundaries of Uber, was what I have named "Uber-idle university" [^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university] which explored an opportunity for learning as I have replaced the arbitrary with talks, Youtube lectures saved as mp3. To make the experience good, I also had to workout certain roadblocks, such as to curate a list of 3-5 talks before the day trips, and to come up with a saying for the passengers, giving them the option to talk with me or let me study what I called "Entrepreneurship lessons in English". Most passengers supported and even encouraged me. 

[^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university]: Marcio S Galli's article "Uber-idle University," published in Ascent Publication on December 2, 2017, delves into the concept of turning idle time into educational opportunities, particularly while performing tasks that don't require full cognitive engagement, such as driving for Uber. Galli, an entrepreneur who drives part-time for Uber, argues that much of the time spent in the car can be repurposed for learning by listening to talks, podcasts, or lectures on a pen drive. He distinguishes between "distractions" and "pauses," suggesting that Uber-related interruptions merely pause his educational experience rather than derail it. The article also highlights how the nature of listening fosters deeper engagement with the content, facilitating opportunities for reflection and understanding. Galli concludes by noting that this practice has led him to be more involved in helping startups, including his own. This article reflects a broader interest in finding innovative ways to incorporate learning into daily routines, a concept that has been especially relevant in the gig economy where traditional work hours are often disrupted. https://medium.com/the-ascent/uber-idle-university-5af317b550d9

### The bundled forces 





Now, as we go back to the space for innovation, it seems that the celebration of the platform, when a network in a state of virtuous growth, which seems to go along with aspects indivated in the approach for scaling of Blitzscaling. From the standpoint of growth, and the view from inverstors interested in scaling platform networks, the analysis is for what elements neeed to be in the place, what forces are fovaourable or against, considering the expectations and vision of the network reaching its full potential. In the story of Uber, a prior network was know as the "yellow cabs" situation. Sequoia partners doing analysis, wanted to invest but to recognize the risks and take a strategy of focusing first in black cars. Sequoia has identified players that were in the field of unbundling the cabs networks, and one of them had the opportunity, although Sequoia wanted them to go back to black, stay away from yellow cabs at that moment. The CEO didn't accept. Later Sequoia end up finding an entrepreneur from San Francisco that were focusing in the black cards and asked if he would be okay with the moving on top of yellow cabs in the right time. And that became Uber. 

Another story, that shows how risks are taken in consideration when the matter are networks, is shown in the story of Linkedin [^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen] where the founders have documented aspects of the struggle to understand when and how to monetize the network. They indicate that some other social networks here real competitors but some of them wanted to make revenue ahead of time, while LinkedIn had a strategy to cover at least USA as a metric for its success with its main customer, corporations looking to hire people. 

[^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen]: 

These situations show intended efforts that seeks a readiness level for the network to be bundled. This is like showing that the curation of the platform, analysis for its future potential, is a must. VC partners of great VC organizations, such as Sequoia, Greylock and A16Z, are examples that show an intended analysis of how networks operate and the risks of scaling. In a way, the body of knowledge from these groups are able to bend reality, from a view from outside. 

But now, back to individuals anr the struggles of entrepreneurs, all of that tell us that stability in the platform produces ooportunities. Or a great platform with network potential involves offering opportunities in a stable matter, the ground for an economic model or interaction that produces value. Which comes after that the aspects which I refered as the prison. 

A complication is that we can be somebody in many of these platform systems, but the experience of being somebody, especially when we are driven by certain metrics, such as performance in attributes such as score, or grades, or money, can also prevent us from seeing opportunities, expect the condition of the exercise of the attempt to maximize effienncy in the network boils back to the situation of feedback that enriches the network. But the point I want to focus now is when being busy can also come with estability of the individual in the network. 

An additional complication is when we are trapped ny many layers. Like consider a phase of a computer game, a game that is more like an experience available in a world that supports games, a network platform for games, and that the game was written on top of an operating system that runs on top of a computer system. 

If the producer of the game experience decides to shut down its servers, impact is first perceived by the network of users experiencing that experience. For them, out of the sudden, the network seems to be down, but they might figure later that the developer-owner gave up. For some, sadness might take place as part of who they are were being exercised in the game environment, through an user profile. 

But when just playing the game, before the incident, it would indeed be quite difficult for one to bend the reality expect if by any chance you had another agenda that could give you the means to see reality from different viewpoint. We should note that while estabily in the platform exists, which pushes me to keep referring it as a prison, the opportunity for freedom is exercised by the users themselves, as each one might live an agenda and their needs can also take them to become creative, from sending suggestions to more deeper reflective experiences. Author Eric von Hippel, in Democratizing Innovation [^foonote_eric_von_hippel_democratizing_innovation], offers a great perspective about how users might become co-creators with producers. 

[^foonote_eric_von_hippel_democratizing_innovation]: 

Now, there are then the improvements within the realm, the hackers, and the ones that might reconsider the whole experience. Thus, we can assert about layers within the platform, and as humans as humans, they could be exposed to deeper reflections about the realities of all these layers that they be me acting in, or even the actual reflections for the ultimate layers which we decided to anchor ourselves in - such as the case of Albert Einstein.

In the realm of innovative products or services, for example, the notion of category design, as indicated by Play Bigger author Christopher Lochhead [^footnote_play_bigger], exposes elements involved for then new categories of products and services are evident.

#### Who owns the truth 





Now, in the heated/cold space of one that lives the experience, it comes the considerations of experiencing that put us to reflect, go seek for truths, challenge the boundaries. When I had reflected about that my first trip as an Uber driver, I took me into writing an article because I considered that the platform could do something about something I saw, a need. Since I had an agenda for reusing the car radio to support my goal of watching talks, I had the opportunity to visualize that Uber-idle University idea. 

Some of these extended experiences can be suggested by platforms too. Consider a Yoga program that guides its participants into the levels of reflections, adding value to the experience. Another example, which I learned from my partner, was a situation of a dance program referred as bio dance, where she has acknowledged that she has reached a level of reflective state about her experience, brought up meaning, as in philosophical reflections which were relevant to others as their dance experience involved a guided experienced with well designed exercises to put the participants in the right spot to reflect. Another example might happen in the situation of reading Harry Potter, as indicated by Kasper ter Kuile the author of The Power of Rituals. Kasper has indicated that the experience from reading Harry Potter has components that brings up a connection with the self, with truths, and life situations, such as to a point of people organize themselves to reflect and discuss about what they experience as they read. The point here to make is that certain experiences might more or less push us towards the reflective interactions about our direct needs vs. internal needs and reflectinve interactions might enable us to explore the limits of the experience too. 

Robert McKee talks about truth and the necessity, for a storyteller, to bring out truth through stories. This same idea might be applicable to entrepreneurship because there is that idea that good ideas and solutions are liberating, that unbundle reality as we know it, and bundles a new reality.

To illustrate the situation, consider the case of a school, referred by Maury Klein in Power Makers, that wrote a post indicating that if God wanted locomotives he would have made humans with locomotive faces. Which shows that whoever wanted to be against locomotives had their own believes about an underlying truth. Conversely, the promoters of locomotives had their own reasons, and values, to promote that as the future. 

Another, anedoctal situation, more of the life in the kitchen, would be the situation that Marcio has identified of the advertisements of one popular convection oven. They would promote as able to fry things with no oil, which seemed great. But also another truth in it is that it would be the best when "frying" oily things



Now, these considerations for entrepreneurs for minimally consider the reflections on living their identities as somebody, on a platform, for leaving too, for reflecting outside. These exercises of writing, enable us to break the flow, sort of to get out from the autopilot was of flowing, acting. Julia Cameron uses methods of writing, with her prompts through articles, as a means for guiding potential writers outside the zone of writers block.
