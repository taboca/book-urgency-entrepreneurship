## It's a space 

This section celebrates the richer terrain that is now given to use by richer networks and platforms, that set us in front of an expanded world of possibilities. And along with that, it asks from us a moment of reflection as for how these new grounds have the power to set us to act, to be directed. My hope is that by pausing to check on our environnent we can augument the invisible hands given by our spaces and to a certain extent be able to be able to silence the voices that so feverish tell us just do it. Let us remember that these voices in the digital and fast-paced world happens to be subtile movements of endorsement of our colleagues given by silent clicks or tapping a screen. 

Some of us are still able to set their hands on the ground and feel the earth - and the joy of a world they don't fully know how on earth it was brought and is what it is. Some of them maybe farmers too that knows what to do with the ground like things that farmers do. While, on the other hand, maybe in a parallel universe in the future, a kid gets to know that an egg comes from a chicken the minute that she sets her ommlet cartridge into the food printer and out of the sudden Clucky is projected, everyday with a different story just like the following example which I had asked an AI system to generate: 

> *"Here at Happy Hen Haven, we live our lives with joy and freedom. Our home is filled with comfortable spaces to roam, play, and flap our wings. And guess what? We eat the most delicious, natural grains you can imagine, with no antibiotics to spoil our meals. Yes, that's right! Our meals are as clean and healthy as the fresh water we sip under the sun. Now, you might wonder what happens to us after we lay our beautiful, nutritious eggs that makes your delicious ommelet. Well, let me tell you, our farm respects every chicken's journey, ensuring we live happily and peacefully. Our friends at the farm make sure we're always healthy and safe. They believe in treating us with kindness and love, which is why our eggs are so special. Enjoy your breakfast. "* ChatGPT by OpenAI 

But as we celebrate the new grounds brought by the entrepreneurial function, and how it sets an influence on us, we may start by the recognizion the two basic ways that function enters our lives, or that it innovate our lives. The first, the more common and less provocative way is known as incremental innovation; which we will get back soon. As for the other, the more provocative way which is what entrepreneurs refer to as "to put a dent in the universe," can be witnessed if we go back in time with Maury Klein from *The Power Makers*, and check how our ancestors reacted as they were greeted by the chugs and hisses of the early locomotives:

But the actual given that we're here, able to rewing and recount many revolutions in transportation from the early visions of the autonomous steam carriages [^footnote_oliverevans_oruktor] to automobile, it set us in driver's seat taking control of the incremental movement of innovation, even to a point of not being impressed when we see a driver in a car behind the windows closed and listening to a song in the radio, comfortably seated in the air conditioning and being nursed by a thick milkshake that lasts for the whole traffic jam.

But if we look at these longer ride from a holistic perspective, starting with the locomotives that entered the tracks of our lives, we aren't just facing how technology changes the economic model and how we exchange value depending on it; but also technology brought ourselves to a new destination where we value technology; such as to value transportation - such as to desire for a faster horse. 

And here again, there is an opportunity to recognize how the function doesn't directly hack into our lives, but it does so indirectly by hacking our own spaces. And for a second if think that entrepreneurs are immune to that, it may be only so because they get the prizes after the changes brought by the ones that succeeded. But that doesn't hide the fact that they might be just another normal worker, the average citizen that in essence takes elements from a space, taking their resources and building blocks from space A and essentially bringing these elements, although arranged in different ways, to a new space B, essentially becoming a bridge.

While this is our next station - to see entrepreneurs in the mddle of two dynamic spaces using tools and building tools - we shall ride through the not far history how how the smartphone evolved to a point that it gave entrepreneurs the motivations to deploy innovation in the space of hail-riding and with that disrupt the taxi industry.

### Bridging spaces 





In the end, we generally know - perhaps the optimists anyway - that the ideas behind the solutions brought to our spaces and lives comes from people that are living experiences first-hand, living the pains and needs, and valuing life and living aspirations, people that are optimistic to dreams for a better life, a better future, for themselves their friends and the civilization. A supporting point to that can be celebrated if we consider a phenomenon known as *User Innovation* [^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation] that explains that users innovate and that many inventions like basketball and Krav Maga or Braille are just iconic examples of a pattern which explains that user innovation is everywhere and that innovation comes first from real people and not from producers. 

[^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation]: MIT professor Eric von Hippel, through the credible book *Democratizing Innovation*, help us to extend further an understanding that the person who lives the experiences, the needs, are often the source of innovative solutions. The work recognizes characteristics of the phenomenon where users aren't passive recipients of products and services but active agents in their creation and refinement.

Yet the given is that the entrepreneurial role takes big part of the credit for getting things done - and for bringing the solutions at the right time and space. That should bring us to recognize that they are the ones that get excited and thankful or frustated and mad about two different spaces at the same time. In other words, they are in between two different worlds: one where they take resources from, a source space, and the other, the target space where they put their creations to be test. That view, although simplistic, can take us to their position in a bridge and then to be the ones living very specific challenges, such as the tension, between what happens on both ends. 

For a better illustration of this entanglement, and the elasticity demanded from these doers, we shall go back to not so far in time, around 2007, and consider what happened that provoked some of these doers to want to put a dent in the universe of the hail-riding experience - the experience of taking rides - and to cause a major impact in the taxi industry later. With the advent of the iPhone by 2007, one thing some entrepreneurs knew, that people were excitingly buying that three-in-one device as promoted by Steve Jobs - of an internet communicator system, a phone, and a music player [^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone]. 

In addition to that, now by 2008, they were also tracking other incremental improvements delivered to the iPhone platform, such as extended battery lifetime, support for the newly released 3G network which meant higher speed and better connectivity to the internet, and not to forget that the iPhone alread had a GPS mechanism as the means for enabling their solutions to track the locations of people carrying these phones.

[^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone]: When introducing the iPhone (2012, June 29) during his keynote presentation at Macworld 2007, Steve Jobs famously described the device as a "three-in-one" product, integrating a phone, an iPod, and an Internet communications device. For reference, iPod had been considered a quite disruptive innovation for the need of listening to music.

With that, and granted that these exciting building blocks were available from that (Apple's) source space, they logically turned their attention to the target space - the places where people where and their lives, which prompted them to rethinking of the ways to taking rides in the major cities around the world. Logically, with the intention of improving their experience, which by the way were logically at the time framed by an specific experience defined by all the prior incremental developments of the the taxi industry; such as that if one wanted to order a ride, they would need to call a central from their phone, or to wave their hands at some of the cars identified by a yellow car in some of the cities around the world, or to go to a specific taxi spot first, and after that once the ride started, to comply with many other rules. As an aside, I remember the day when I left my phone in a cab in San Franscisco and how comfortable I was to know that I would never see it again. But another experienced was tougher when I felt trapped in a complex situation being a host to my friends from Mozilla organization visiting Brazil and caught myself taking a ride in the streets of Porto Alegre at 110 km/h afraid to ask the driver to reduce the speed at the same time holding my hands tight and fearing a big news for the next day that "Mozilla contributor Marcio Galli kills the chairwoman of Mozilla," or a more attractive headline like "How Mozilla crashed and died in Brazil." 

And since these entrepreneurs could see that the bridge seemed real linking these two different spaces, that led them to ask further questions such as, are these people really buying this actually quite expensive iPhone thing? Would it be possible for them to give them an experience where they could call a ride for any place in the city by tapping the screen on their phone where they could see the driver in the screen, how far they were, how long they would take, and even follow them in the map in real time? If they could see the fares ahead of time before saying yes or no, to pick the size of the car, and logically, much more, such as to rate the driver behavior, if he and if she were driving safe or not.

Moreover, many other questions came along, the more the bridge seemed real. One of them would be to ask how difficult it would be for people to install that new experience in their iPhones. Thankfully, for these developers and for iPhone users, Apple had created a place for people to browser and install these experiences which is essentially an marketplace [^footnote_apple_marketplace] integrated in the phone. Basically, any user using an iPhone would be able to browse through many different applications from different companies, to read about the company offering them, to trust knowing that Apple had some information about the producers, and to then install. For developers, that meant a way to distribute, an easier way for their users to install, and in addition to that, as a consequence, what would enable the word of mouth. These and other conditions seemed to be a green light for them to move on, to proceed to disrupt the hail-riding industry or the cab industry or taxi industry as you wish. 

[^footnote_apple_marketplace]: 







But all of that, still, is about the visualization of the bridge and has anything to do with the getting things done. And the actual challenge that these pioneers will leave as they try to do it, as they enter the space, what brings them to say that reality is different, which we will follow with Brad Stone, of Upstarts (Stone, B., 2017). 

Moving forward to 2008, an iPhone app known as Taxi Magic was becoming popular in the U.S. as it had expanded across 25 cities, giving riders the ability to order standard taxis from their phones. That perspective shows that the strategy of Taxi Magic were essentially improving the existing situation, probably challenging some of the aspects, but essentially playing fair and in agreement to the taxi industry. On other hands, of other founders, they thought that in order for riders to have a better experience, the known situation of the hail-hailing experience needed to change. If we look at the original business presentation from Uber - Uber's original pitch deck (2017, August 23) - they point to the poor experience of ride taking as connected with the taxi monopolies.

Now that history shows that Uber survived, and given that many riders don't even know the world as it were before, can be challenging for us to see how these founders were struggling at the time. According to Brad Stone, these were philosophicaly differences. For Taxi Magic leadership, a particular moment had challenged them to reconsider their views, when Bill Gurley - the renowed partner of Benchmark Capital later to be known as the major investor in Uber - had engaged in what was referred as "a prolonged courtship" (Stone, B., 2017, p. 71) that culminated in an offer of $8 million in investment [^footnote_bradstone_investment_uber] which was declined. 

In an interview given to Brad Stone, DePaschoale the then-chairman Taxi Magic, had recognized that "Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably." DePaschoale had given to us the feeling of how the perspective is felt when you are there, in the road, in front of cross-roads, where you can't embrace all and have to take a path. 

[^footnote_bradstone_investment_uber]: According to Brad Stone, the conversations between Taxi Magic and Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, had eventually arrived at an verbal offer from Bill Gurley, who proposed an $8 million investment at a $32 million valuation (Stone, B., 2017, p. 71).

But given that an experienced person like De Pasquale, that were quite involved in the business that had achieved a certain level of maturity, to even use the word bet, it reveals not only the multiple potential bets in place, but that these were in fact different strategies or perspectives, as in theses, more than anything related with gambling. In other words, his phrasing that reveals a certain degree of humility, is not enough to hide the well-informed characteristizations of their strategies. And that brings us to the revelation of other aspects in the struggle between the more incremental approach, which is playing by the rules, or the more disruptive approach, to provoke the space, or even the possibility of a strategy that shifts from one to the other, as in to unleash the disruptive after what seems to be the incremental; which may be particularly recognized when Bill Gurley approached De Pasquale as part of the inclinations for investments, and had advised De Pasquale to step away, initially from the taxi and yellow cabs, positioning the service as similar to limo cars instead, deferring the full potential for other chapter. As we know from the history of Uber - the team that end-up receiving the investment of Bill Gurley and Benchmark Capital - they actually started in the limo space, or black cars, but eventually took over and impacted the space of the general taxi experience.

That situation that appears to be a crossroad is essentially a revelation that, to a certain extent, they have to decide which way to take. In other words, that what they need to deliver to the target space is something that needs to be built. Something that is tangible, coherent, marketable, and understood by people, and likewise by the competition or anyone else that objects. That new thing in the space. If that's not enough of a challenge, it brings us to the challenges and concerns of the modern business world and the dynamic environment of entrepreneurship, where they are challenged to consider that they do bundle things and unbundle. Not in the sense that they are able to quickly refactor the entire organization, but in essence that that consideration of refactoring anything thought is more relevant as the world becomes more dynamic. In other words, that if anything bundled has ties with other spaces, unbundling reveals the reconsideration of these ties and the dynamic nature of these spaces.

### Bundle and unbundle 

Sometimes, if not generally, we get acquainted with new terms by the on-the-fly practice, when we are suddenly in a new working space and someone throws a tool and before you know you catch it and a you are told to keep cranking. The term 'bundled' came to me like that because it was said a lot within the buildings at Netscape - the iconic company that created or popularized, or bundled, the internet browser. Once in the field I essentially became part of a machine of people that we were *bundling* an internet browser. As an aside, I shall note that my passion for English had origins from the world of programming languages. So words like *While*, *If*, *Then*, *For* and others had influenced me to sometimes say things like: *While* I am here, working in United States, I am happy to build things *Until* some major event calls me back to Brazil. *If* friends invite me to dinner, *Then* I shall comply.  

But it was after I returned to Brazil - and had a bit of time - that I found something more about bundle, that bundle had to do with unbundle, by listening to the thoughts from some of the leaders of Netscape, Jim Barksdale and Marc Andreessen. 

Now I know that the situation of entrepreneurs who pushed them, especially in the beginning and also in the long run, to generally not refactor their offerings or to unbundle whatever they had thought and had bundled. Likewise as anything built is essentially built by the fact that their bridge were bundled in the first place and that may involve the managerial means. That leaves the idea of unbundling an offering to connect to the necessity of the unbundling of the bridge and reveal the ties of multiple spaces, which could be quite challenging because you are re-evaluating your sources, which is not generally a consideration, not until the act of getting things done consumes resources. Yet the recognition of the unbundling or the bundling-unbundling dynamics is a real movement that creates challenging situations in shorter cycles exactly because of the dynamic space such as where the competition exists and bundles things with ties with different spaces, which set us to at least verify an exploration that luckily was given to us through a great exercise, led by entrepreneurs and executives that had disrupted and invented the Internet browser, popularized the Internet browser and went through the necessity to rethink the offerings and not only setting the product in a different way, but setting the bridge in different ways, as told by Jim Barksdale from the days when he was the CEO of Netscape [^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale] going through the rise of the Mozilla project.

[^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]: The idea of bundle and unbundle is generally promoted by Marc Andreessen, one of the creators of the first popular internet browser that co-founder of Netscape. Marc is a well-known investor and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, A16z, an iconic venture capital firm from Silicon Valley. 

To consider this narrative, let us situate ourselves in the days that the incremental innovations in the space of the Internet brought the Web. Yes, so the Web was brought to the people that could understand and navigate the Internet space. But that wasn't the web for normal users anyway. The Web for normal users came about because the Internet browser were invented. Thus, in the space of people - reading news - something new came up to them, it seemed to be a thing disrupting newspapers anyway, the Internet browser. Netscape was built, and they indee had put a dent in the universe. The browser was something bundled, a product. Once the user had downloaded it, it was coherent. If your computer is connected to the Internet, you can then type the address of a company, and voilá, the page shows. So all were nice, and Netscape were growing and their proprietary technology, their bundled things like the Netscape Navigator, were an excitement that led Netscape to be the highest IPO in history. 

That up the moment when Microsoft decided to look at what a browser really meant. To simplify a long battle - known as browser wars - Microsoft had bundled a free Internet browser in its Windows operating system, thus making it not necessary for many people to even download Netscape. In other words, Microsoft affected the space of Netscape, and with that the evident notion that Netscape product could only be used "on top" of Windows, thus that Netscape was a customer of Windows to a certain extent. This is where the idea of bundle and unbundle sets in more properly, not only because Microsoft had bundled Internet Explorer but because the bundled Netscape, as it is, led Netscape as a company to be bleeding and bleeding fast. This also took Netscape to consider to rethink its strategy.

--> 

In an interview for Justin Fox, for Harvard Business Review (Fox, 2014), Jim Barksdale recalled line came about during Netscape's public offering roadshow. Jim and his team were at the Savoy Hotel in London, pressed for time and facing a room full of British investment bankers. When questioned about Microsoft's potential to bundle a browser into their product - “How do you know that Microsoft isn’t just going to bundle a browser into their product?” - he made a statement for how an innovative competitor product were essentially consist the destrution of the values of its competition and by that it would ground itself as new values: "Gentlemen, there’s only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling," and followed by "Well, best I can tell, most people spend half their time adding and other people spend half their time subtracting, so that’s what works out, " so satisfy the needs of an audience that were puzzled but curious. 

According to Jim, although the comment wasn't carefully crafted, it was intuitive and captured the truth that innovations essentially deals with adding and subtracting elements of a given value proposition. 

To illustrate the challenges of the forces behind Bundling and Unbundling, we may recount the history of the internet browser and the rise of the web, which Marc Andreessen and Jim Barksdale, along with others, had the opportunity to witness and be part of the whole experience and the tension between these forces. As history shows, Netscape arrived and launched a worldwide popular browser back in the days and became the highest IPO in history at that point by the bundling of the web browser, the means to navigate the web, which was a proprietary technology and tied with the internet building blocks and the notions and the concepts and the standards of the web that were evolving, incrementally evolving, if you will. At that point, with the new experience unleashed, many people became excited because that was basically like accessing the addresses of companies worldwide, navigating, enabling all sorts of new services like search and indexes and Yahoo, AltaVista, and many companies were able to have websites online. Everything was fine and great, the greatest IPO ever, up to the point that we realized that the internet browser had to run on top of another platform. The Windows operating system was the most popular among normal users. And with that, the challenging moment became when Netscape were challenged by Microsoft as Microsoft had bundled a free browser, Internet Explorer, to the Windows popular operating system. It should be noted, as early noted by people from Netscape, that people had to manually install the Netscape browser, by hand, which meant that overnight Netscape were bleeding. That is what had characterized part of the browser wars, and even the lawsuit against Microsoft for unfair practices. 

But the point - going straight or back to bundling and unbundling is exactly what were happening back in the days as Gene Barks recognized that they had to do something and the response had to do with the unbundling. If they kept the way it is, they would lose the war, of course, they were losing quite fast, they were bleeding, but the response was a very aggressive response, they had to do with facing their death as a company. So if we had to kill ourselves, what would we do it, right? And the response went along with incremental developments because open source were happening at that point and many of these companies were using open source technologies and the browser became this iconic case of a major project being open sourced by Netscape, that's the rise of the Mozilla project, according to CodeRush.

The notions of bundling and bundling, as we have seen through the Netscape browser history, also reveals not only the characteristics of adding and subtracting elements of a given setting, but also the interdependencies, like when a given creation is grounded in a given platform. And along with that, the possibility that other forces - like the competition or an industry - might be exploring aspects of the undelying platform, which gives us the invitation to consider that the rise of a platform is nested inside other platforms or entangled with other spaces. Therefor, let us look at the history of Silicon Valley, or in other words, how Silicon Valley was bundled, as an opportunity for us to exercise the potential and directedness of platforms, either influencing us or giving us the possibility to rethink that.

By now, we may summarize that the phenomenon of bundling and unbundling may happen at the surface, which could be like incremental innovations, which is a softer approach, or it can be harder where it accesses the core or the underlying elements that enables a potential disruptive innovation. In the case of Netscape, to a certain extent, they were forced in a position to make a decision and to revisit underlying concepts enabling the product to be bundled in different ways. Therefore, when they had embraced open source - for a product that were proprietary - they arrived at that to a certain extent motivated by the competition. On the other hand, that was possible because the community of engineers and in special pioneers in the forefront of open-source had envisioned the of elements from the different space of open-source - and new methods for building things - that could reinvent collaboration in new ways which would be the challenges they had to do as the code open would demand the means to manage contributions from a lot of external people. In other words, once they embraced that popular bundled experience to be based in open-source, they took themselves to embrace other challenges such as to enable the full potential of collaboration. This, from Netscape to Mozilla to Firefox is to recognize that the underyling refactoring of managerial movement were happening and quite successful. 

What we have considered by the prior illustrations and anecdotes, shall set us to embracing the infinite possibilities where anything that changes a space has ties with multiple different spaces and its underlying assumptions, or the means to get things done from these, which makes evidently clear that entrepreneurship deals with that choreographic movement that needs to be done in harmony and to produce what is coherent which is essentially a management aspect.




Yet, this complex arrangement of what's bundled, given that it is tied with so many relationships with different spaces and needs to get done, brings to us the complicated reality that it's not easy to see all these different ties. And furthermore, the more we advance, it's more normal that people enter a given space and start building things, not knowing necessarily what's behind all that. As an example, if a kid loves a game and inside that game develops friendships with colleagues, and as she grows and sees values in that paricular universe it may to a certain extent become part of her normal life thus influencing her growth towards being an adult - or towards maturity. And that's certainly what's happening to many of us, because either social networks or social games and the ideas of the experiences given by the metaverse are essentially worlds that were built first; and it may well be the case that the players, or the users, or customers or call them whatever you want, really know what's going on behind the world as they see it. The way that I realized that was by witnessing the situation of my niece and her relationship with what were apparently a game platform - Roblox - as she guided me to understand a little bit about that world. What I took from her guidance was that I had entered a digital gaming platform where multiple users could play together, interact. As she had invited me to a specific city, I had noticed interactions between players like a community. And things were fine, and she even got excited because she started to create movies of herself acting in that city - in other words she were recording the screen with her character - her avatar - and even got to a point of making scripts, asking her friends to collaborate. But then, one day, she was quite sad because she received the news that the city would go away, because she heard that the developer were considering to kill his server. I don't know what happened there, if that was a rumor or not, but seemed to be something the end of the world anyway; like a prediction. Nevertheless, it is a good illustration of how one can be pretty involved, not only because of the intrinsic values by the social dynamics within the game, but because of extra values that these dynamics may give to them, which was the case of the extra meaning for my niece in the real world - the thing about making movies - although a more simple example of value that transcends can be the observation of friendship or colleagueship among players. 


Of course, this example of children growing as a user of a specific universe may be scary to some parents, or, could be seen as educational to a certain extent by others, like the possibility that people could understand moral values such as the meaning of loss. But even more concerning can be that the very same effect happens in the world of adults. As an example, developers in the information technology industry may value underlying technologies - such as open source - which could set them to be attracted by other opportunities that depend on open-source. As an another example, if one is involved in other themes like the underlying foundations of cryptocurrencies, they may well endorse systems or platforms created on top of networks that they trust, that they love and are involved with. And that again, it may not be a problem, it could be that they see a future in there, granted; but yet still it reveals that we are entangled and driven by a forward movement which is tied to other movements in different spaces. Let us then go proceed to explore a bit about the magnitude of these entanglements by looking at a brief moment in the history of Silicon Valley and some of the  bundling and unbundling movements that had chaptered in Silicon Valley.






#### Growing in a growing space 

Because of the too many ties for anyone to understand - if not boring for a business book - I thought of giving us a viewpoint for how I had witnessed the formation of digital platforms, as a kid from the age of ten, around 1985, and moving forward along with the growth of the information technology industry to a point of moving to Silicon Valley. Not different from many other folks that were taken by computers, for me it something new started as I had witnessed some of the first video games, then the early personal computers, then the emergence of the internet browser, then witnessing the early mobile phones - up to now that I have a quite powerful smartphone that receives too many notifications to the point that I had to install "an app" referred as a digital well-being app that allowed me to turn off many of the online apps too so that I can actually get to work, and do focused work, like what I am doing now. 

The origin of seeing things as platforms, or spaces, started to grow from around 1985. These where the days when video games existed already so it was exciting to be growing around these systems. But generally with video games it was sad that we had no way to create those games, or to modify them ourselves. One could only dream and wonder about how these games were made, of course excited about the possibilities of modifying it - What if I could change the clothes of the hero? Of what if I could change the color of the background, or the number of lives, and more. But it didn't take long before my father brought the personal computer. This was a different box because it also had games in it but it had something else which was a more acessible door inviting us to do that kind of custom work. That was the message. You can use the same machine to actually write new things that runs in the machine. And a kid would naturally ask - can all be done from that? And the answer was yes, one could engage and create software systems, and even other video games. 

So the first thing to learn was what the technical folks would call *The Operating System* and too other esential tool referred as *The Programming Language*. With a programming language you can write your own game. So I took that as the truth which made me assume that the computer I had was a thing that enabled the development of games. Since my goal was to build my own game I tried. But it didn't take long for me to start to understand that the programming language that I were using was too simple or limited. So my game seemed to be impossible with the platform I were using. The solution I heard was that I had to write games in a more complex programming language what the technical folks refer as *The Machine Language*. Needless to say that I had no pointers like access to the Internet. The books we had were magazines and I likely didn't express to my parents my intents to dive into that level of detail. So, I had decided to pivot since I were anxious for results and tried to do something more simple. 

Also time were moving and I would be by now using a better computer. Since I liked to draw I tried to make a software for drawing what the technical folks would refer as a graphics editor. Although that seemed simpler comparing with video games, and I went quite further, I caught myself again limited by the tools I were using or limited by the complex thinking involved to make that work with the limited resources too. Since I couldn't really make that graphics software how I wanted I endup feeling like being somebody usefaul writing software solutions for the world of adults, what technical folks refer as commercial systems. 

Those were simple, I felt as somebody useful and could even help some adults too. It was exciting and this is how I came to understand that systems for people, or what technical folks would refer as users, were written using programming languages, the things that developers could write games, or graphic editors, or word processors and commercial applications. So right there I would be an user experiencing a number of platforms. To consider the evident ones, first the computer itself. And "on top of that," as the technical professional would say, there is an operating system. And on top of that operating system, the tools for programming. Another evident observation is how I were able to do things, like to write my own software system, but too had to respect the limits of these platforms, to use the tools that they had offered. 







If we follow the story of a kid growing around computers, and a tiny slice of the world of computers, and the growth of the information technology industry, up to the web and the world of browsers, we're likely not missing the phenomenon that out of that being unleashed because of the economic opportunity, in other words, newspaper companies had become content providers in the digital world, just as a tiny example. But along with that, the inevitability of a movement where a kid could be becoming a professional in a given new space that was promising and growing. In other words, the world of browsers, its tools and related underlying systems was evolving exactly because of the economic model and characteristics of the space potential. As for my case, I ended witnessing the formation - and getting paid along - of the Web Developer role [^footnote_marcio_web_developer], which brought myself to be invited to work at one of the iconic companies of the time - Netscape - which were amazing to navigating that space. But the important point for us is evidently formed by now - that the space is quite real, and one can be quite busy exactly because of that intense movement which may also become a sort of inertial movement. While a lot is changing and you may feel like somebody, it should also be recognized that a lot seems immutable, for one in the craft looking the building blocks they are comfortable with. So for me it too had seen walls in that source space, given by the building blocks that the browser makers and web makers had produced. Yes, the knowing that I was working around the people making the browser gave me a reasonable hint about how the underlying reality we flexible; but it couldn't give me a full view, a transcending view, about what were the underlying things happening. I did not have the time to understand the relativeness of all, and even to understand if I were trapped or not, how to escape, for instance, such as to access the day which I would embrace becoming a writer. And even for the bright minds that may become leaders of these major platforms - they too can be carried but what happens. I would think that the leaders of the social networks that had been wildly and widely embraced by people really didn't mean to enable people to be siloed within their own groups of afinity and where their supporters would echo their beliefs. With all the good intentions, from the optimistic perspective, the rise of social networks started with that premise that one could meet anyone in the world with the six degrees of freedom - anyone is not far from the president. I recall those days and that ideal. But too, I confess, by following the movement, I didn't notice when the social network became a world that were to create to me six degress of walls. 

[^footnote_marcio_web_developer]: The web developer, formed after the Internet browser enabled organizations to make sites and software systems available through web browsers. The web developer would then become a worker for the medium of the Web. https://hackernoon.com/the-history-of-web-developers-tied-to-browser-development





Thus it comes with that too, that even in the digital space, we shall be set under conditions that can be quite difficult to see the miracle of how these tools and systems and arrangements are formed and how one thing depend on another on so many levels of abstractions, especially when we are busy and producing. Perhaps, we get a bit of that feeling that something else exists when out of the sudden we get to be disconnected; in my case when it was a day when the electricity went off out of the sudden. More younger ones would recall the same feeling if the Internet went off - it is then when some infrastructure that we take for granted is taken out that we in fact almost get interested in celebrating how far too many things are interconnected. 




Let's extend this idea a bit further with Maslow from *Memorandum on Syndrome Dynamics and Holistic, Organismic Thinking*, an strange title perhaps but as strange as us taking for granted all that makes any of these spaces possible: 

> *"The fact is that the enterprise, let's say Non-Linear Systems, is embedded in its immediate community; in all sorts of specifiable ways this immediate community is embedded in the larger community, let's say the Southern California area, which in turn has very definite and functional relationships with the state of California, which in turn is embedded in the United States, which in turn is embedded in the Western world, which in turn is embedded in the whole darn human species and the whole darn world. There are functional relationships in the sense that demonstrable causes and effects can be listed, and they can be listed by the thousands. The fact that these are normally overlooked and taken for granted has nothing to do with the case. For instance, the fact that Non-Linear Systems has just one night watchman instead of a private army of three thousand people equipped with machine guns and cannon is taken for granted, but this can be taken for granted only when the relationships work so well. Or the fact that the enterprise is dependent upon the town for the supplies of water, electricity, and gas, for the maintenance of roads, for fire and police departments, not to mention doses of other services like restaurants and shopping centers and markets and the like, which make it possible for people to live in the area, which makes it possible in turn for them to work in the plant. If anybody who worked at non-linear systems took a risk of being assassinated on the main street, then the enterprise would, of course, disappear. This should be spelled out; it should be consciously understood that Non-Linear Systems rests on a whole network of assumed relationships, services, etc. It is, in a word, "contained within" as in a syndrome, or even more accurately it is "contained-and-structured within."* (Maslow, p. 135)

Having us consider the effects of a kid growing inside spaces created by revolutions in Silicon Valley, open source and other underlying developments of the web from all the places of the world We may then recognize some other side of this equation, which is the movements that happen in terms of disruptive innovation and then incremental innovation in terms of the underlying platforms technological platforms given Silicon Valley, informing Silicon Valley







#### The expanding universe 


To further explore these entanglements, we may go dig into the computer's history, first looking at the computer microprocessor and the little elements that can't be seen with the naked eye but nevertheless required a new sight from management in order to evolve. The tiny element inside processor is known as the transistor and where a big invention back in 1947 [^foonote_history_transistor].  This element is also referred as a semiconductor device but it is one that acts as a switch that can either allow or not allow energy to flow depending on a signal. An exampe of a big switch would be a door in a room that allows one to go out, if the door is open, so then once out she shouts out information. Now the magic in the computer world happens because transistors can be arranged with others and can form the microprocessor. If I insist with the door analogy, the microprocessor would be a big house with lots of doors where some of these doors openned could open of close others. 

Well, and before my analogy confuses both of us, let us move to the a ballpark figure comparing the evolution of these microprocessors. The then-popular personal computer known as the IBM PC from 1981, which was a significant point in the computing history, carried an Intel microprocessor that had about 29,000 transistors [^footnote_history_transistor_count]. Fast-forward 39 years, the Apple Iphone 12 powered by Apple's A14 Bionic microprocessor carries around 11.8 billion transistors. In other words, in terms of transistors, an Iphone 12 microprocessor is about 406,000 times in terms of transistors comparing to an IBM-PC from 1981.  We should remind ourselves that the size of the transistors became much smaller, enabling faster response and less usage of battery, for example, so as for the last analogy it would be tittle little castle. 

[^foonote_history_transistor]: The transistor, a fundamental building block in the world of electronics, was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Laboratories. This groundbreaking invention marked the beginning of a new era in electronic technology, enabling the development of smaller, more efficient, and more reliable devices. 

[^footnote_history_transistor_count]: As noted in the Wikipedia article "Transistor count" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count), estimates are provided for the transistor count of the Intel 8086 chip and the 8088 chip used in the IBM PC. The article also includes information on the transistor count for the Apple iPhone 12's chip, A14 Bionic microprocessor, among others.

Since obviously our idea is not to get technical but to celebrate the relativeness between these spaces, let's shift our focus to the history of Silicon Valley, back to 1956 when Shockley Semiconductor were founded by the co-inventor of the transistor in the beautiful Santa Clara Valley - a region of California known at the time for an agriculture producing orchards, apricots, prunes, cherries, plums, and more. I have used an AI tool to doublecheck information about William Shockley by asking "Was Shockley that went to live in the bay area with his mother?," to which the tool replied: 

> *"Yes, William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor and Nobel Prize laureate, moved to the Bay Area, specifically Mountain View, California, in 1956 to be closer to his ailing mother. This move was significant because it led to the establishment of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, the first semiconductor company in the place that would be later known as Silicon Valley. Shockley's decision to relocate there and start his semiconductor company played a crucial role in the development of Silicon Valley as a major hub for high-tech innovation and development."* ChatGPT, 2024. 

As an aside, the transistors made by Shockley Semiconductor were made of Germaniun, while later Silicon became a more suitable  material for transistors; which explains why we call it Silicon Valley and not Germanium Valley. Another aside that I don't want to check the accuracy comes from when I first visited the Netscape campus back in 2000 and driving around the parking lot I asked my manager "what is that interesting object that looks like a little lighthouse?" To which he said that it was a super fan probably pulling chemicals from the ground and dumping far away in the air. I don't know if he was joking or not but I was scared and wondered about how things were before our days - the browser days. Now I remember too that from time to time a very shiny - and likely expensive equipment - would appear at different locations in our building. They told me that those were there to measure the quality of the air. 

Now if we consider some of the transformations from 1956 - the Shockley days - to 1981 when Intel were unbundling their own 8086 platform architecture and bundling Intel's next generation of microprocessors, we will see it too how these technological developments went along with the needs for new management perspectives. 



#### Creative destruction of management 


From the founding of Intel to backwards, we can track that Intel were founded by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore. And if we rewiend more, we'll find that these same individuals happened to be part of a team of founders known at the time as *The Traitorous Eight* [^footnote_trairorous_eight] - a group of colleagues from Shockley Semiconductor that left and had founded Fairchild Semiconductor. 

[^footnote_trairorous_eight]: The "Traitorous Eight" refers to the eight engineers and scientists who left Shockley Semiconductor due to dissatisfaction with management. They were Gordon Moore, C. Sheldon Roberts, Eugene Kleiner, Robert Noyce, Victor Grinich, Julius Blank, Jean Hoerni and Jay Last; and founded Fairchild Semiconductor; which opens our minds to consider how the idea of leaving a company, and with it its management practices and culture, were connected to the needs of a market in development. 

The history around the *Traitorous Eight* is an invitation for a reflection for how the bundling of a new technological opportunity may depend on unbundling other fundamental elements in the space of management and even culture: While William-Shockley-the-inventor was brilliant the William-Shockley-the-manager was considered to be terrible by colleagues which prevented the opportunity ahead and led these eight colleagues to leave Shockley to create Fairchild Semiconductor. And if you are reading this wondering "what a big deal to leave bad management" keep in mind that in 1957 the idea of an employee leaving a company were considered as wrong - very wrong - which led Shockley to describe their leaving as a betrayal (Wikipedia, 2024).

Now, allow me to see all of these companies as like departments of a one big company. With that, we can then proceed to think that Shockley had produced Fairchild. As as seen, that Fairchild brought Intel. But not only Intel, as according to *Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley* (2016, December 20), Intel was one of other 126 spin-off companies also known as Fairchildren.

--> 

Now let's consider the possibility that the *Traitorous Eight* - as an event up to the point that Shockley having accused them of being traitors - could have accelerated a process waiting to happen: that it produced an impact in the views especially in Silicon Valley, minimally and initially to the people working at Fairchild Semiconductor, producing more open views such as for leaving a company, such as in circumstances of bad management.

It is expected too that Fairchild had a better management and as well that its employees would not not fear much to consider creating new companies where many of them may be amond the 126 spin-off Fairchildren [^footnote_fairchild] companies. This event and managerial movements would likely produce a shift in the culture of the people working in Silicon Valley not only in terms of needs for better management but producing a mindset for openness which were essential elements a development of that industry and technological revolution. 

[^footnote_fairchild]: According to Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley Fairchild Genealogy (2016, December 20), a published print known as Fairchild Genealogy chart from 1986 included 126 semiconductor companies that were traced directly to Fairchild.

And if we keep forwarding the Silicon Valley movie all the way to Intel days yet focusing on the managerial perspective, we get to celebrate the writings of Andy Grove, Intel's first hire that later became CEO and the author of the influencial management book entitled High Output Management. While High Output Management has produced direct impact to a lot of other innovators in Silicon Valley and around the world, is it too the historical proof of the managerial transformation and how quick these new managers had to do something about it. To note, Andy Grove wrote High Output Management and Only the Paranoid Survive while working at Intel. 

<!--
@meta @todo
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Environment, Space - Check reference if Andy Grove were really first hire. @meta-refid 1212-2223-3392-9394
--> 



As a matter of fact, the very new management practices that Andy Grove were involved with for many years during the challenging days of Intel led Intel to enter a new space of opportunity, leaving Intel as a memory manufacturing company, becoming Intel, which became widely known as the microprocessor manufacturing company and the realizations of the new space of opportunity since the microprocessors were becoming the central element of enabling value in the face of the emerging and growing needs and access of personal computers by people. Which takes us to understand the realization that Andy Grove had that the configuration of the personal computers inside small businesses and homes of people and all sorts of different businesses were actually becoming a central platform where all sorts of values would be able to be added on top or inside that space by all sorts of companies. Therefore, the fruition by the creative potential of many other entrepreneurs that wanted to contribute inside that new space of opportunity were happening and quite fast and spreading, specifically around Silicon Valley and other parts of the world as well. That essentially enabled the computer to sell peripherals like printers and many other opportunities given that configuration of the flexibility and the ability to customize a computer from software to operating systems to applications and we are not even yet considering the internet and the networked interoperable web which would come later of course as discussed.



I may also acknowledge here the notes from Andy Groove from On*Only the Paranoid Survive* about the rise of the Internet, and his views about what we're coming up at that point is very applicable to conclude this section: 

> *""* Andy Grove

With these considerations, the illustrations, give us an idea to celebrate the nature, or the phenomenon, that after space is materialized. Driven by the ties of different spaces where the sources and resources come from, it develops by its economical setting, unleashing a creative potential of collaboration that reaches a point of saturation. It follows that people ground themselves until the moment that they cannot support anymore, as if the walls are about to be broken anyway but likely by the refactoring of the underlying ties that were sustaining that world as it seemed; claiming for different choreography of these ties, enabling people to get out from that box, get out from that saturated condition, and freshly enter new worlds then to become normal builders in the eld. This could be the case, although there are many other elements there, but to name a few, that throughout the Industrial Revolution, on the rise of autonomous machines and the mechanical developments, went along with the end of slavery and the needs for more specialized automation throughout the end of the 17th century and the early 18th century.

Now if these ideas are tipping us that we shall be waiting for underlying things to happen, that isn't the case; as many as we have considered the doers in the arena, real people, are carriers of aspirations for a better future. This, we should acknowledge that the ideas for transcending comes too from within the box, exactly because we're essentially - although sometimes missing the point - interested in improving the lives of the well-beings and civilization. That idea should invite us to the means that are quite practical in the everyday life of entrepreneurs - and serve for them to improve the lives of people and come up with solutions, incremental or not, even solutions that can from within the box awake new experiences that transcends the traps they live, which usually transcend by exercising acessing the higher hopes for the human being and civilization and that does so by respecting the well-being, essentially. Let us move on into that, into transcending spaces.

## Transcending the box 





Assuming us acquainted in the environment, if not by the motion of the prior movement of entrepreneurship then by the considerations so far, we shall ask ourselves if and how can we innovate from the box - from the living space that incessantly teases us with reasons to build which may well offer unintended consequences like distractions. For that, we may now shift to moments before the action of getting things done and recognize the movement that happens to ignite them, like the one that that energizes them even to make them jump to build the bridge without noticing what they are doing. If one had the time to notice, it could come from feeling a discomfort about their situation as it is. For other, an optimistic, or a romantic aspiration for a better future. They may too live an epiphany or get involved for the sake of growing as people and a lot more. But it is undeniable that the movement sets them to figure if they should build that bridge - the why - and figure how to conduct the elements from the source - the how - in ways that produce a solution that is coherent to the destination of people - the what.

* @outline - Situation - Innovation management is concerned with that - JTBD - innovator's dilemma - still, how to be involved and find the relationship?
--> 



Now, if they hire themselves - if they choose to accept this mission - they will enter a holistic journey consisting of many job steps - to organize, plan, check the go-no-go, execute, and monitor how they do it - which sets them to live an experiential learning while living the hopes that their bridge can sustain itself by the movement it provokes to the environment. This necessity for sustainability is independent of their outcomes, thus it won't matter if they produce softer changes at the surface or harder ones that disrupts the core. As an example of the softer, back to the car thought initially as a means for transportation, the situation that a car can be stuck in traffic or if the location is hot or if the ride is long or the weather is cold can certainly prompt them improve the experience of drivers, to launch solutions like the air conditioner, a music player, heated seats, and more. Or they too be more oriented to the rearrangements of the means to the end, such as reinventing the methods and how to use of resources to build cars and any solutions in it such as to reduce the costs of production. As for going deeper an innovative solution to the target space may consist of removing the necessity of humans driving, with autonomous driving; and in terms of the source space could be about a new kind of engine. Now, as a consequence of the disruptive situation, the outcomes produced may actually bridge again these spaces; as an example a new engine that is advanced and (in the long run) simpler to produce may also change the experience of the drivers, like avoiding them to have to fuel their cars. 

Now one thing the world of innovation knows - that whatever it is it won't survive if the customers are not interested in using it and able to use it. While that does not give all the answrers to how to do it, it a good interesting problem to celebrate; and also a reason for us to celebrate some insights from the researchers and practitioners concerned with the challenges of innovation. A major challenge recognized by these minds has to do with the problem of listening to the people. The listening is vital, as people living experiences carries the answers, but as entrepreneurs had matured the challenge may involve not strictly listening to them as they are essentially to a certain extent like entrepreneurs living in the box and then to entangled with the existing solutions for doing things, to involved to transcend from their ways of doing, which explains that famous concern - which may or may not have said by Henri Ford - but that was formed to addres the complication that if these producers had asked to people they would have told that they wanted a faster horse [^footnote_henryford_fasterhorse]. 

[^footnote_henryford_fasterhorse]:

That faster horse is not a bad thing to want, so it may be that "these people," if they existed, were right. On another hand, assuming that producers could not produce faster horses, the challenges for addressing what to do would depend on knowing what people were trying to do with a faster horse, or to figure what people were doing it, to listen to their routines, their needs, their expectations as they were involved in their daily jobs. 

This is where an insightful perspective from Professor Clayton Christensen - the renowned professor from Harvard Business School and author of the book, *The Innovator's Dilemma* - came to help entrepreneurs and led practitioners to further develop structured models to help entrepreneurs to innovate forward by looking at the environment of their customers. This work is known as Jobs to Be Done which is essentially about not asking customers what they want, as solutions, and shifting the focus to understand the needs of the customers by looking what they are trying to get done. The famous illustration, given by a narrative created by professor Clayton and his colleagues, can be recounted before our further discussions: 

> *The researcher inquired further: “Tell me about a time when you were in the same situation but you didn’t buy a milk shake. What did you buy instead?” Sometimes, he learned, they bought a bagel. But bagels were too dry. Bagels with cream cheese or jam resulted in sticky fingers and gooey steering wheels. Sometimes these commuters bought a banana, but it didn’t last long enough to solve the boring-commute problem. Doughnuts didn’t carry people past the 10 am hunger attack. The milk shake, it turned out, did the job better than any of these competitors. It took people 20 minutes to suck the viscous milk shake through the thin straw, addressing the boring-commute problem. They could consume it cleanly with one hand. By 10:00, they felt less hungry than when they tried the alternatives. It didn’t matter much that it wasn’t a healthy food, because becoming healthy wasn’t essential to the job they were hiring the milk shake to do.*" (Christensen, Cook, & Hall, 2005)

One key takeaway from the milkshake business case may be the implication that the milkshake can help a different people in the same situaton - people living the need for drinking/eating while driving, thus not a specific demographic. Now if we focus in the Jobs to Be Done further, we also observe that they do their things, that they get their things done, thus that they carry answers as they carry needs; and that they are quite involved in their attempts to improve their situation, thus willing to pick solutions, or to hire solutions as the system says. As a consequence, yet another takeway, is that the listening to the collection of the many insights about the needs of groups with same needs may well support the exercise of transcendence that enables entrepreneurs to come up with solutions. 

On the other hand, it is yet challenging because if we dig too far things may reach out to concerns that also transcends from beyond the things people do, as in their aspirations. As in, if we dig too much, we may go all the way to things like to live longer, to be happier, to give people means to learn better, and more. Thus, the complication for the ones interested in getting things done has too to do with finding a stable place where they are engaged as somebody into the why to do it, how to do it, and what to do it. This challenging movement can be emphasized by the words of Michael Dearing given an an interview with Reid Hoffman:

Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other. And so if you energized by the idea of coming up with a technical insight and then moving to productization and then moving to the business building phase, that journey will be satisfying and exciting to you. If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies. If you find yourself endlessly prototyping and tinkering with the product without regard to the business economics, then that’s a warning flag as well."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 47:47)

The message from Michael and the further considerations are reminders about the importance of us to be in a sweet spot - a place that is meaningful for ourselves and that serves well to the both spaces, the sourcing space and the target space of users. Yet, another reason for us to be calmer and to be reflective as we are searching, or refining, or exploring the what to do. Moving forward in this direction, let us consider an annecdote about how any space can connect with with far too many needs and then settle ourselves to recognize the challengs for stability as we position between the sourcing world and the target space of users.

### 1000 trips in a box 



I used to joke among friends - when we happened to be drinking and thinking that we had an insightful idea - that the best ideas would come from the shittiest places; usually followed by some of us noticing that the saddest part would be that we wouldn't remember anything the next day. This is yet another supporting point as for why the rise drinking coffee[^footnote_blitzscaling_ted_coffee] helped us to become better builder of things. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_ted_coffee]: During the Blitzscaling lecture 3 by Michael Dearing, *Blitzscaling 03: Michael Dearing on Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction* (Greylock, 2015), a student chimed in, reminding us that the rise of coffee shops throughout Europe as spaces for exchanging ideas was parallel to the growth curve of the industrial revolution. An elaboration on this observation is found in Steven Johnson's TED talk, "Where good ideas come from" (TED, 2010), where he expands about enlightened developments through Europe that went along with a society of coffee drinkers as opposed to a society of drunken people.

But if any truth exists there is a hint that it takes quite a trip to see through, to break the walls of our spaces. Thus, I invite you through a moment when I did about 1,000 trips as an "Uber driver," and a reflection about the conditions must exist for ideas to rise from the places and situations that people live. In other words, that first-hand experience is not enough, for example if one is too busy living the experiences first-hand and not able to transcend aiming for a different situattion, which can be the case when we are in a hurry which wasn't my case we will see. 

In other words, I wasn't a normal driver. In fact, no drivers should be considered as "normal drivers." That attempt - to see people in buckets such as to call them "motorista de aplicativos" as they call in Brazil - may well be one of the reasons that makes things difficult for us to see through. I would say that I was following the playbook because I wasn't full time. I were doing on Fridays and I wanted to rethink my life, to understand how things worked, to make some money, to live the experience, and to be somebody. But make no mistake I saw myself as a real Uber driver whih took me to keep up and reach out to the 1,000 rides throughout 2017. Thus, as driver, I were happy to help people, being more calm in the the traffic, and connecting with people such as that day that I did an extra effort to help a lady to setup her wheelchair, or the other day which I took a pregnant woman - who was close to her due date - to the hospital. As a driver I was proud and wanted to see if I could be a 5-star driver. 

But as for the a-ha moments I had noted that it comes from everywhere - from the drivers and their experiences - while it onl rises to the surface if some extra conditions are met that set us to be open to possibility. A particular experience leading to a solution was connected with the experience of the first trip - a trip I won't forget because I felt in a calling - to fight my fears - to face the fears of driving into difficult streets, to face my fears of not being a good driver, my fears of allowing strangers in the car, and a more. One thing I recall vividly was how I felt in the end of the first day, surprised that I was alive and happy that I was happy and how excited I were to tell my parents. While I felt the fears of that first trip and the feelings of having done it nothing really came out in terms of ideas, like solutions. But it was later that the dots connected when I caught myself listening to an idea from a friend which I had encouraged to become a driver. It could be that he knew that I was an entrepreneur that took him to call me and ask if I could come up with a "simulation app" to help a new driver with their first trip. He wanted an experience where he could turn on his smartphone and where the screen would look like a real trip, where he had to pick up an imaginary passenger from a location and take her to another. I didn't do anything but the conversation became a reflection that became an article [^footnote_uber_first_trip] which went along, as I found later, with recognitions about the challenges of the first trip as told by Ed Baker, a former "Head of Product" from Uber:  

[^footnote_uber_first_trip]: Drawing from my initial Uber driving experiences, I had the opportunity to write an article and to reflect about the challenges of that first trip situation that could happen to many other drivers. Read more in Why that first Uber (driver) trip never happened. Ascent Publication. https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc

> *“For me, it was eye-opening when I did my first trip as a driver. I walked out to my car, I have done everything, I was activated. I walked out to my car [and] I walked back to my house because I got so nervous about doing that first trip.”*

So right here we might pause for a moment to consider that the problem of transcending, while it connects with what people feel when they are living the experiences first-hand, it only happens if the conditions for possibility of change are seen. Thus, this is yet a situation to support that situations of growth, or rush, or too busy, may well set us to not access these naturally unless action is taken. 

Another opportunity I came accross went beyond the boundaries of the setting given by Uber and I took further action. This one was "Uber-idle university" [^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university] and and consisted of a solution for learning while driving. Since at the time I needed to study entrepreneurship lectures, then I had the idea of replacing the normal car music with lectures. Because my phone wasn't good enough at the time to run the Uber app and audio, the solution I found was to save the lectures from Youtube as audio and download to a portable flashdrive and then to plug in the car radio. All were great for a while but not entirely working because of a few roadblocks. To make the experience better, I figured that I had to spend time to curate a list of good talks before taking the road, thus reducing the risks of too many bad lectures in a row which could make me lose the entire day. Another challenge had to do with the passengers - if they would accept - which I solved by telling them in advance that those were my "Entrepreneurship lessons in English," and that I was good to turn off. Not to my surprise, the support was great and so I was able to watch more than one hundred talks on entrepreneurship and to recognize that the moment of being an app driver was much less distracting than the being in front of the computer.    

[^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university]: The article entitled "Uber-idle University," explores how I end up exploring the time inside the car with educational content and shows  an example of the playlists I were using. Read more in https://medium.com/the-ascent/uber-idle-university-5af317b550d9


With that, we can celebrate that solutions are linked to the experiences and feelings and the needs of users which can be observed from various levels of abstraction. From those one-thousand trips, I had the chance to see basic improvements to Uber the application, like problems with their system, but also explored the experience of the conditions, such as of the new drivers living that first trip problem. And as we had seen, the other experiences that transcended the scope given initially. A reflection about this situation may also be an opportunity to recognize that beyond the conditions to access the needs of people, the initial movement to come up with a potential solution depends on something from other more significant insight which reduces the variability of what can be done - or in other words a great idea leading to a solution is one that needs to be coherently understood by the audience. 





### Searching stability in the target space 







Although this situation has told about my own story inside the Uber for a thousand trips may give us a moment to think about the driver that is just outside and the place not living in that condition of hardness that has something to do with transcending that may be necessary for the incremental function to find things to do I think I may have stumbled in a number of elements that I was motivated to a certain extent to write about but those weren't enough motivating me to shift from driving inside the car to actually engaging with the action because likely I didn't see myself if I had the conditions in a stable position to move a lot to recognize that many ideas indeed come from the first hand experience but recognizing that when we engage to do something beyond the ideas and move ourselves to action we only set ourselves in front of a complicated situation which is to further be provoking ourselves if we really want to do it it essentially set us in a position of a challenging position of discovering more about what's behind what we didn't see and also to discover if we ourselves were really interested in doing it which will likely bring the entrepreneur to recognize that goals such as far ahead goals not so long but slightly far ahead like a horizon really really matters we celebrate the idea with the following reflection from Michael Dering when he was interviewed from Rick Hoffman about what it takes to continue and move.

If we consider the research instability in the target space, we are essentially recognizing that we are now closer to the market. And with that, the first thing of a situation for ourselves is to celebrate how the environment of the market is so strong to mislead us and even to come up and be motivated by a movement, like a commercial movement, taking from how we value the idea of markets in the first place. You may remember from prior discussions that our entanglements with the environment and the constructions in the environment of entrepreneurship brought to us the perceptions that methods and ways to do things and the means to do things are essential tools, just like a technological tool or a hammer is for something. Again, the environment is also comprised with the methods or the practices or frameworks and more than that, our ties with how we measure the potential in the target space. One of these ties that we are so involved with is to see the target space by certain frames, like to see that the market is market under some assumptions. And that's a key complication for us because what we are essentially trying to do is to disrupt or to innovate and to help people. We are not dealing with the market. The perception of the market is itself a measurement. One example is to see the market as a demographic. We are so much doing this because of our ties with the ways we came from. The world of producers and products and things that have influenced people to a point of seeing people as a market. And even the idea of cohorts to a certain extent is an evolution of that, but yet it may have something in there as well.

Therefore, and we're moving closer to many of the greater insights that a job to be done team brought to us, we're in front of opportunity to also transcend how we measure these things, like how we measure the market. And how even many of the frameworks may be created in the first place based on these views and perspectives that we had before. Even Lean Methods. That consideration gets even more valuable when we see that the practitioners and leaders in the field of the Lean Methods are very aware that we shouldn't see markets as we always saw. Like the reflections from Steve Blank and the Tony Uwick team, they recognize that the market may essentially not be about the demographics and in fact related to the needs. As the following quote confirms.

Another key takeaway of the jobs to be done, strategic and thoughtful and structured thinking of this special team, namely Ted, Tony, and others there, is their interest to see the fundamental aspects that brings innovation in the middle of the spaces of people, transcending to a certain extent. For instance, giving us great ideas for how to find stability in terms of the people needs. One key aspect that they bring is the idea of job stats. That's essentially, they had identified a kind of canonical, consistent characterizations of what a job is. That all the jobs always follow that same path, the following path. With that, what they're bringing to us in terms of insights, is that if any solution is to be created to any space of one that is running a job, this solution is to a certain extent improving one or more of these stats. And it goes along that the job is only stable when, independent of these solutions, the job is still there. In other words, if the solutions are coming in, being subtracted, in or out, but yet that job persists. It may be a place that we can anchor ourselves there. Of course, if you have interests to be anchored there.

[^footnote_jtbd_tony]: JTBD (Jobs to be Done) theory, as developed by Tony Ulwick and Strategyn, presents a groundbreaking framework for innovation. Central to the framework is the notion that customers "hire" products or services to accomplish specific jobs or tasks in their lives. By understanding these jobs in detail, companies can innovate by creating offerings that precisely meet the needs of their customers. Ulwick's approach involves the understanding of the job steps and opportunities associated with a job, providing businesses with a structured process to identify and and come up with ideas to solve unmet needs or met needs in creative ways.

### Searching stability sourcing 







<!--
@meta @todo 
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Environment, Spaces, Bundled forcers - Consider the insight from Maury Klein for the unleash of innovation that had happened when the Bolton and Watt patents expired. Check the quote from 53-54 of The Power Makers: "versions of a railroad had been around since at least the 17th century to ease the hauling of coal and ore from mines. Railroads paved with stone were built. Around 1630, an Englishman named Belmont got the bright idea of replacing the stone with heavy planks. This gradually evolved into rails made first of wood and then of iron. By the late 18th century, the wheels running over these rails had flanges to improve their grip. The road of rails had become familiar at least to miners by the early 19th century, but it lacked a source of power beyond the horse. The steam engine was an obvious possibility. Work on it expanded rapidly after the 1800s when the Bolton and Watt patents expired. Across England, the continent, and the United States, men with a mechanical bent tinkered doggedly with versions of the steam engine, each one in search of a unique solution to whatever problem or challenge intrigued him. Some worked in the privacy of their own homes, others went into the business of building engines. Many of the men who had worked for Bolton and Watt took their expertise elsewhere or went into business for themselves. They soon realized, as did most of other builders, that the Watt low-pressure engine would not do for a land carriage because it simply could not generate enough power. Yet, strong fears remained about the dangers of high-pressure engines. As late as the 1820s, in England, the stationary steam engine was still considered a serious, even preferred alternative to the high-pressure engine for railroad motive power."

Now, as we go back to the space for innovation, it seems that the celebration of the platform, when a network in a state of virtuous growth, which seems to go along with aspects indivated in the approach for scaling of Blitzscaling. From the standpoint of growth, and the view from inverstors interested in scaling platform networks, the analysis is for what elements neeed to be in the place, what forces are fovaourable or against, considering the expectations and vision of the network reaching its full potential. In the story of Uber, a prior network was know as the "yellow cabs" situation. Sequoia partners doing analysis, wanted to invest but to recognize the risks and take a strategy of focusing first in black cars. Sequoia has identified players that were in the field of unbundling the cabs networks, and one of them had the opportunity, although Sequoia wanted them to go back to black, stay away from yellow cabs at that moment. The CEO didn't accept. Later Sequoia end up finding an entrepreneur from San Francisco that were focusing in the black cards and asked if he would be okay with the moving on top of yellow cabs in the right time. And that became Uber. 

Another story, that shows how risks are taken in consideration when the matter are networks, is shown in the story of Linkedin [^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen] where the founders have documented aspects of the struggle to understand when and how to monetize the network. They indicate that some other social networks here real competitors but some of them wanted to make revenue ahead of time, while LinkedIn had a strategy to cover at least USA as a metric for its success with its main customer, corporations looking to hire people. 

[^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen]: 

These situations show intended efforts that seeks a readiness level for the network to be bundled. This is like showing that the curation of the platform, analysis for its future potential, is a must. VC partners of great VC organizations, such as Sequoia, Greylock and A16Z, are examples that show an intended analysis of how networks operate and the risks of scaling. In a way, the body of knowledge from these groups are able to bend reality, from a view from outside. 

But now, back to individuals anr the struggles of entrepreneurs, all of that tell us that stability in the platform produces ooportunities. Or a great platform with network potential involves offering opportunities in a stable matter, the ground for an economic model or interaction that produces value. Which comes after that the aspects which I refered as the prison. 






A complication is that we can be somebody in many of these platform systems, but the experience of being somebody, especially when we are driven by certain metrics, such as performance in attributes such as score, or grades, or money, can also prevent us from seeing opportunities, expect the condition of the exercise of the attempt to maximize effienncy in the network boils back to the situation of feedback that enriches the network. But the point I want to focus now is when being busy can also come with estability of the individual in the network. 






An additional complication is when we are trapped ny many layers. Like consider a phase of a computer game, a game that is more like an experience available in a world that supports games, a network platform for games, and that the game was written on top of an operating system that runs on top of a computer system. 

If the producer of the game experience decides to shut down its servers, impact is first perceived by the network of users experiencing that experience. For them, out of the sudden, the network seems to be down, but they might figure later that the developer-owner gave up. For some, sadness might take place as part of who they are were being exercised in the game environment, through an user profile. 

But when just playing the game, before the incident, it would indeed be quite difficult for one to bend the reality expect if by any chance you had another agenda that could give you the means to see reality from different viewpoint. We should note that while estabily in the platform exists, which pushes me to keep referring it as a prison, the opportunity for freedom is exercised by the users themselves, as each one might live an agenda and their needs can also take them to become creative, from sending suggestions to more deeper reflective experiences. Author Eric von Hippel, in Democratizing Innovation [^foonote_eric_von_hippel_democratizing_innovation], offers a great perspective about how users might become co-creators with producers. 

[^foonote_eric_von_hippel_democratizing_innovation]: 

Now, there are then the improvements within the realm, the hackers, and the ones that might reconsider the whole experience. Thus, we can assert about layers within the platform, and as humans as humans, they could be exposed to deeper reflections about the realities of all these layers that they be me acting in, or even the actual reflections for the ultimate layers which we decided to anchor ourselves in - such as the case of Albert Einstein.

In the realm of innovative products or services, for example, the notion of category design, as indicated by Play Bigger author Christopher Lochhead [^footnote_play_bigger], exposes elements involved for then new categories of products and services are evident.

#### Who owns the truth 


Now, in the heated/cold space of one that lives the experience, it comes the considerations of experiencing that put us to reflect, go seek for truths, challenge the boundaries. When I had reflected about that my first trip as an Uber driver, I took me into writing an article because I considered that the platform could do something about something I saw, a need. Since I had an agenda for reusing the car radio to support my goal of watching talks, I had the opportunity to visualize that Uber-idle University idea. 

Some of these extended experiences can be suggested by platforms too. Consider a Yoga program that guides its participants into the levels of reflections, adding value to the experience. Another example, which I learned from my partner, was a situation of a dance program referred as bio dance, where she has acknowledged that she has reached a level of reflective state about her experience, brought up meaning, as in philosophical reflections which were relevant to others as their dance experience involved a guided experienced with well designed exercises to put the participants in the right spot to reflect. Another example might happen in the situation of reading Harry Potter, as indicated by Kasper ter Kuile the author of The Power of Rituals. Kasper has indicated that the experience from reading Harry Potter has components that brings up a connection with the self, with truths, and life situations, such as to a point of people organize themselves to reflect and discuss about what they experience as they read. The point here to make is that certain experiences might more or less push us towards the reflective interactions about our direct needs vs. internal needs and reflectinve interactions might enable us to explore the limits of the experience too. 

Robert McKee talks about truth and the necessity, for a storyteller, to bring out truth through stories. This same idea might be applicable to entrepreneurship because there is that idea that good ideas and solutions are liberating, that unbundle reality as we know it, and bundles a new reality.

To illustrate the situation, consider the case of a school, referred by Maury Klein in Power Makers, that wrote a post indicating that if God wanted locomotives he would have made humans with locomotive faces. Which shows that whoever wanted to be against locomotives had their own believes about an underlying truth. Conversely, the promoters of locomotives had their own reasons, and values, to promote that as the future. 

Another, anedoctal situation, more of the life in the kitchen, would be the situation that Marcio has identified of the advertisements of one popular convection oven. They would promote as able to fry things with no oil, which seemed great. But also another truth in it is that it would be the best when "frying" oily things



Now, these considerations for entrepreneurs for minimally consider the reflections on living their identities as somebody, on a platform, for leaving too, for reflecting outside. These exercises of writing, enable us to break the flow, sort of to get out from the autopilot was of flowing, acting. Julia Cameron uses methods of writing, with her prompts through articles, as a means for guiding potential writers outside the zone of writers block.
