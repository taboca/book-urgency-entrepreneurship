## It's a space 

This section celebrates the richer terrain that is now given to use by richer networks and platforms, that set us in front of an expanded world of possibilities. And along with that, it asks from us a moment of reflection as for how these new grounds have the power to set us to act, to be directed. My hope is that by pausing to check on our environnent we can augument the invisible hands given by our spaces and to a certain extent be able to be able to silence the voices that so feverish tell us just do it. Let us remember that these voices in the digital and fast-paced world happens to be subtile movements of endorsement of our colleagues given by silent clicks or tapping a screen. 

Some of us are still able to set their hands on the ground and feel the earth - and the joy of a world they don't fully know how on earth it was brought and is what it is. Some of them maybe farmers too that knows what to do with the ground like things that farmers do. While, on the other hand, maybe in a parallel universe in the future, a kid gets to know that an egg comes from a chicken the minute that she sets her ommlet cartridge into the food printer and out of the sudden Clucky is projected, everyday with a different story just like the following example which I had asked an AI system to generate: 

> *"Here at Happy Hen Haven, we live our lives with joy and freedom. Our home is filled with comfortable spaces to roam, play, and flap our wings. And guess what? We eat the most delicious, natural grains you can imagine, with no antibiotics to spoil our meals. Yes, that's right! Our meals are as clean and healthy as the fresh water we sip under the sun. Now, you might wonder what happens to us after we lay our beautiful, nutritious eggs that makes your delicious ommelet. Well, let me tell you, our farm respects every chicken's journey, ensuring we live happily and peacefully. Our friends at the farm make sure we're always healthy and safe. They believe in treating us with kindness and love, which is why our eggs are so special. Enjoy your breakfast. "* ChatGPT by OpenAI 

But as we celebrate the new grounds brought by the entrepreneurial function, and how it sets an influence on us, we may start by the recognizion the two basic ways that function enters our lives, or that it innovate our lives. The first, the more common and less provocative way is known as incremental innovation; which we will get back soon. As for the other, the more provocative way which is what entrepreneurs refer to as "to put a dent in the universe," can be witnessed if we go back in time with Maury Klein from *The Power Makers*, and check how our ancestors reacted as they were greeted by the chugs and hisses of the early locomotives:

> *"As rails spread across the land, opposition came from canal owners, some states that had invested heavily in canals, turnpike and bridge companies, stagecoach lines, tavernkeepers, and anyone who saw his business threatened by the railroad. Some people even raised religious and moral objections. An Ohio's school board warned in 1828 that 'if God had designed that His intelligent creatures should travel at the frightful speed of 25 miles an hour by steam, He would have foretold it through His holy prophets. It is the device of Satan to lead immortal souls down to Hell.'"* (Klein, 2009, p. 57)

But the actual given that we're here, able to rewing and recount many revolutions in transportation from the early visions of the autonomous steam carriages [^footnote_oliverevans_oruktor] to automobile, it set us in driver's seat taking control of the incremental movement of innovation, even to a point of not being impressed when we see a driver in a car behind the windows closed and listening to a song in the radio, comfortably seated in the air conditioning and being nursed by a thick milkshake that lasts for the whole traffic jam.

[^footnote_oliverevans_oruktor]: Oliver Evans' Oruktor Amphibolos is often considered the first amphibious vehicle and an early example of steam-powered machinery, representing a significant milestone in the history of engineering and invention. The Oruktor was detailed in Evans' patent, notable for being one of the first in the United States to cover a machine rather than a method of manufacture, granted in 1804.

But if we look at these longer ride from a holistic perspective, starting with the locomotives that entered the tracks of our lives, we aren't just facing how technology changes the economic model and how we exchange value depending on it; but also technology brought ourselves to a new destination where we value technology; such as to value transportation - such as to desire for a faster horse. 

And here again, there is an opportunity to recognize how the function doesn't directly hack into our lives, but it does so indirectly by hacking our own spaces. And for a second if think that entrepreneurs are immune to that, it may be only so because they get the prizes after the changes brought by the ones that succeeded. But that doesn't hide the fact that they might be just another normal worker, the average citizen that in essence takes elements from a space, taking their resources and building blocks from space A and essentially bringing these elements, although arranged in different ways, to a new space B, essentially becoming a bridge.

While this is our next station - to see entrepreneurs in the mddle of two dynamic spaces using tools and building tools - we shall ride through the not far history how how the smartphone evolved to a point that it gave entrepreneurs the motivations to deploy innovation in the space of hail-riding and with that disrupt the taxi industry.

### Bridging spaces 





In the end, we generally know - perhaps the optimists anyway - that the ideas behind the solutions brought to our spaces and lives comes from people that are living experiences first-hand, living the pains and needs, and valuing life and living aspirations, people that are optimistic to dreams for a better life, a better future, for themselves their friends and the civilization. A supporting point to that can be celebrated if we consider a phenomenon known as *User Innovation* [^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation] that explains that users innovate and that many inventions like basketball and Krav Maga or Braille are just iconic examples of a pattern which explains that user innovation is everywhere and that innovation comes first from real people and not from producers. 

[^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation]: MIT professor Eric von Hippel, through the credible book *Democratizing Innovation*, help us to extend further an understanding that the person who lives the experiences, the needs, are often the source of innovative solutions. The work recognizes characteristics of the phenomenon where users aren't passive recipients of products and services but active agents in their creation and refinement.

Yet the given is that the entrepreneurial role takes big part of the credit for getting things done - and for bringing the solutions at the right time and space. That should bring us to recognize that they are the ones that get excited and thankful or frustated and mad about two different spaces at the same time. In other words, they are in between two different worlds: one where they take resources from, a source space, and the other, the target space where they put their creations to be test. That view, although simplistic, can take us to their position in a bridge and then to be the ones living very specific challenges, such as the tension, between what happens on both ends. 

For a better illustration of this entanglement, and the elasticity demanded from these doers, we shall go back to not so far in time, around 2007, and consider what happened that provoked some of these doers to want to put a dent in the universe of the hail-riding experience - the experience of taking rides - and to cause a major impact in the taxi industry later. With the advent of the iPhone by 2007, one thing some entrepreneurs knew, that people were excitingly buying that three-in-one device as promoted by Steve Jobs - of an internet communicator system, a phone, and a music player [^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone]. 

In addition to that, now by 2008, they were also tracking other incremental improvements delivered to the iPhone platform, such as extended battery lifetime, support for the newly released 3G network which meant higher speed and better connectivity to the internet, and not to forget that the iPhone alread had a GPS mechanism as the means for enabling their solutions to track the locations of people carrying these phones.

[^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone]: When introducing the iPhone (2012, June 29) during his keynote presentation at Macworld 2007, Steve Jobs famously described the device as a "three-in-one" product, integrating a phone, an iPod, and an Internet communications device. For reference, iPod had been considered a quite disruptive innovation for the need of listening to music.

With that, and granted that these exciting building blocks were available from that (Apple's) source space, they logically turned their attention to the target space - the places where people where and their lives, which prompted them to rethinking of the ways to taking rides in the major cities around the world. Logically, with the intention of improving their experience, which by the way were logically at the time framed by an specific experience defined by all the prior incremental developments of the the taxi industry; such as that if one wanted to order a ride, they would need to call a central from their phone, or to wave their hands at some of the cars identified by a yellow car in some of the cities around the world, or to go to a specific taxi spot first, and after that once the ride started, to comply with many other rules. As an aside, I remember the day when I left my phone in a cab in San Franscisco and how comfortable I was to know that I would never see it again. But another experienced was tougher when I felt trapped in a complex situation being a host to my friends from Mozilla organization visiting Brazil and caught myself taking a ride in the streets of Porto Alegre at 110 km/h afraid to ask the driver to reduce the speed at the same time holding my hands tight and fearing a big news for the next day that "Mozilla contributor Marcio Galli kills the chairwoman of Mozilla," or a more attractive headline like "How Mozilla crashed and died in Brazil." 

And since these entrepreneurs could see that the bridge seemed real linking these two different spaces, that led them to ask further questions such as, are these people really buying this actually quite expensive iPhone thing? Would it be possible for them to give them an experience where they could call a ride for any place in the city by tapping the screen on their phone where they could see the driver in the screen, how far they were, how long they would take, and even follow them in the map in real time? If they could see the fares ahead of time before saying yes or no, to pick the size of the car, and logically, much more, such as to rate the driver behavior, if he and if she were driving safe or not.

Moreover, many other questions came along, the more the bridge seemed real. One of them would be to ask how difficult it would be for people to install that new experience in their iPhones. Thankfully, for these developers and for iPhone users, Apple had created a place for people to browser and install these experiences which is essentially an marketplace [^footnote_apple_marketplace] integrated in the phone. Basically, any user using an iPhone would be able to browse through many different applications from different companies, to read about the company offering them, to trust knowing that Apple had some information about the producers, and to then install. For developers, that meant a way to distribute, an easier way for their users to install, and in addition to that, as a consequence, what would enable the word of mouth. These and other conditions seemed to be a green light for them to move on, to proceed to disrupt the hail-riding industry or the cab industry or taxi industry as you wish. 

[^footnote_apple_marketplace]: 







But all of that, still, is about the visualization of the bridge and has anything to do with the getting things done. And the actual challenge that these pioneers will leave as they try to do it, as they enter the space, what brings them to say that reality is different, which we will follow with Brad Stone, of Upstarts (Stone, B., 2017). 

Moving forward to 2008, an iPhone app known as Taxi Magic was becoming popular in the U.S. as it had expanded across 25 cities, giving riders the ability to order standard taxis from their phones. That perspective shows that the strategy of Taxi Magic were essentially improving the existing situation, probably challenging some of the aspects, but essentially playing fair and in agreement to the taxi industry. On other hands, of other founders, they thought that in order for riders to have a better experience, the known situation of the hail-hailing experience needed to change. If we look at the original business presentation from Uber - Uber's original pitch deck (2017, August 23) - they point to the poor experience of ride taking as connected with the taxi monopolies.

Now that history shows that Uber survived, and given that many riders don't even know the world as it were before, can be challenging for us to see how these founders were struggling at the time. According to Brad Stone, these were philosophicaly differences. For Taxi Magic leadership, a particular moment had challenged them to reconsider their views, when Bill Gurley - the renowed partner of Benchmark Capital later to be known as the major investor in Uber - had engaged in what was referred as "a prolonged courtship" (Stone, B., 2017, p. 71) that culminated in an offer of $8 million in investment [^footnote_bradstone_investment_uber] which was declined. 

[^footnote_bradstone_investment_uber]: According to Brad Stone, the conversations between Taxi Magic and Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, had eventually arrived at an verbal offer from Bill Gurley, who proposed an $8 million investment at a $32 million valuation (Stone, B., 2017, p. 71).

@meta @todo/edit/decide 
* @todo/edit/decide - p2 ( ) - In Space / Bridging Spaces - According to Jordan Peterson it makes sense to compare ways of putting the prose. We have option A and B. Option A "In an interview given to Brad Stone, DePaschoale the then-chairman Taxi Magic, had recognized that "Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably." DePaschoale had given to us the feeling of how the perspective is felt when you are there, in the road, in front of cross-roads, where you can't embrace all and have to take a path. But given that an experienced person like De Pasquale, that were actually involved in the business that had achieved a certain level of maturity, to even use the word bet, it reveals not only the multiple potential bets in place, but that these were in fact different strategies or perspectives, as in theses, more than anything related with gambling. In other words, his phrasing that reveals a certain degree of humility, is not enough to hide the well-informed characteristizations of their strategies." And option B is "In an interview with the chairman of Taxi Magic, De Pasquale, his recognition that Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably, had much less to do with innocence or lack of professionalism and more in terms of revealing the size of the challenge they were onto. Given the experience of a professional like De Pasquale, quite involved in that business that had reached to a certain extent a level of maturity, to even use the word bet is more to do with the humbling spirit that went along the more these leaders get into the growth potential in a space where uncertainty is maintained at the proportion of the potential they unleash." / @meta-refid 1223-3321-2323-3344

In an interview given to Brad Stone, DePaschoale the then-chairman Taxi Magic, had recognized that "Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably." DePaschoale had given to us the feeling of how the perspective is felt when you are there, in the road, in front of cross-roads, where you can't embrace all and have to take a path.

In other words, his phrasing that reveals a certain degree of humility, is not enough to hide the well-informed characteristizations of their strategies. 





And that brings us to the revelation of other aspects in the struggle between the more incremental approach, which is playing by the rules, or the more disruptive approach, to provoke the space, or even the possibility of a strategy that shifts from one to the other, as in to unleash the disruptive after what seems to be the incremental; which may be particularly recognized when Bill Gurley approached De Pasquale as part of the inclinations for investments, and had advised De Pasquale to step away, initially from the taxior the "yellow cabs," as known in the U.S., positioning the service closer to the category of the "limo cars" instead, deferring the full potential for a future chapter. As we know from the history of Uber - the team that end-up receiving the investment of Bill Gurley and Benchmark Capital - were actually in that limo space, or black cars; but eventually took over and impacted the space of the general taxi experience.

That situation that appears to be a crossroad is essentially a revelation that, to a certain extent, they have to decide which way to take, how to proceed. In other words, what they are about to deliver the move they enter the space of the real world, with that something that needs to be built, has to come to terms with the necessity of being tangible, coherent, marketable, and understood by people, and accepted by the world. The metaphor of the brigde is then a step, and more than to push further the glamour, it celebrates the moment of vulnerability, like the vulnerability of a marriage that sets in. In this marriage, a proposition is for two forces, the How-to-do with the What-to-do, for the hopes that a new child is given, transformation and impact to the environment. Through that celebration, where the romantic notion is there and where love and energy are present, there is too the presence of other forces that are interested, like the forces of competition or the forces in favor; but basically everyone that is interested in what changes. From there, every single moment of materialization that follows essentially ask the question, again and again, "if anyone objects to these forces, please speak."

Next, we shall then celebrate how a notion of bundling [^foonote_bundling_old] gained significance in the modern business world as a result from the richer creations of entrepreneurship that gained distribution powers - i.e. the operating system or software systems bringing other systems together - essentially becoming platforms for delivery of values (plus other things) by exercising more direct influence in what the user is eating, or the user's plate. Thus, the observation that the whole world started to be concerned with the things "being bundled," within all things delivered to them, is in fact an effect from the fact that the business world had being busy exercising the potential of bundling things into things delivered. And likewise as an implication of that, we shall too consider the challenges since action of entrepreneurial world had too gained more dynamism by the existance of modular things - enabling entrepreneurs to bundle things quicker - which in turn sets them into challenges, exactly because things bundled from the world of entrepreneurial action is not untied from the entangled and existing world of prior things given. 

[^foonote_bundling_old]: A historical perspective about the usage of "bundling" from the past and the modern usage is given by in Bundling (2000) which elaborates about the original usage from an old courtship practice where young couples spent nights together in a single bed, either tied or "bundled" up to prevent physical intimacies; to the usage in modern business terminology where "bundling" referred to the strategy of selling multiple products or services together as a single package, offering convenience but also raising concerns about potential anti-competitive effects.
