## It's a space 

Before we step further in the space of entrepreneurship, we shall celebrate first the situation of our environment that gives us the opportunities to work faster - to build things faster - given by the technological advancements that produced opportunities for reaching networks and using platforms that inescapably suggest infinite possibilities. It follows from that, a potential good reflection where we shall ask if these new grounds, which give us the power to act, are in any way directing us. 

Digging in our environnent may help us to see the invisible hands through the concretes in our spaces - technology - and how we smoothly run on these fast-paced platforms all together mobilized by the interactions from our networks that to a minimal level mobilize us with digital claps and likes. 

As we will set our hands dirt, let's recount the two ways in which the function modifies our own spaces and how it innovates our lives. The first, a less provocative way, the one generally known as incremental innovation, we will get back soon. As for the provocative way, which is more exciting and generally refered as the way "to put a dent in the universe," we can witness what it does as we go back in time, with Maury Klein from *The Power Makers*, and check how our ancestors reacted by the chugs and hisses of the early locomotives:

> *"As rails spread across the land, opposition came from canal owners, some states that had invested heavily in canals, turnpike and bridge companies, stagecoach lines, tavernkeepers, and anyone who saw his business threatened by the railroad. Some people even raised religious and moral objections. An Ohio's school board warned in 1828 that 'if God had designed that His intelligent creatures should travel at the frightful speed of 25 miles an hour by steam, He would have foretold it through His holy prophets. It is the device of Satan to lead immortal souls down to Hell.'"* (Klein, 2009, p. 57)

But the actual given that we're here, able to rewing and recount many revolutions in transportation from the early visions of the autonomous steam carriages [^footnote_oliverevans_oruktor] to automobile, it set us in driver's seat taking control of the incremental movement of innovation, even to a point of not being impressed when we see a driver in a car behind the windows closed and listening to a song in the radio, comfortably seated in the air conditioning and being nursed by a thick milkshake that lasts for the whole traffic jam.

[^footnote_oliverevans_oruktor]: Oliver Evans' Oruktor Amphibolos is often considered the first amphibious vehicle and an early example of steam-powered machinery, representing a significant milestone in the history of engineering and invention. The Oruktor was detailed in Evans' patent, notable for being one of the first in the United States to cover a machine rather than a method of manufacture, granted in 1804. For more details, see [Oliver Evans' Oruktor Amphibolos on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Evans#Oruktor_Amphibolos).

But if we look at these longer ride from a holistic perspective, starting with the locomotives that entered the tracks of our lives, we aren't just facing how technology changes the economic model and how we exchange value depending on it; but also technology brought ourselves to a new destination where we value technology; such as to value transportation - such as to desire for a faster horse. 

And here again, there is an opportunity to recognize how the function doesn't directly hack into our lives, but it does so indirectly by hacking our own spaces. And for a second if think that entrepreneurs are immune to that, it may be only so because they get the prizes after the changes brought by the ones that succeeded. But that doesn't hide the fact that they might be just another normal worker, the average citizen that in essence takes elements from a space, taking their resources and building blocks from space A and essentially bringing these elements, although arranged in different ways, to a new space B, essentially becoming a bridge.

While this is our next station - to see entrepreneurs in the mddle of two dynamic spaces using tools and building tools - we shall ride through the not far history how how the smartphone evolved to a point that it gave entrepreneurs the motivations to deploy innovation in the space of hail-riding and with that disrupt the taxi industry.

### Bridging spaces 








In the end, we generally know - perhaps the optimists anyway - that the ideas behind the solutions brought to our spaces and lives comes from people that are living experiences first-hand, living the pains and needs, and valuing life and living aspirations, people that are optimistic to dreams for a better life, a better future, for themselves their friends and the civilization. A supporting point to that can be celebrated if we consider a phenomenon known as *User Innovation* [^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation] that explains that users innovate and that many inventions like basketball and Krav Maga or Braille are just iconic examples of a pattern which explains that user innovation is everywhere and that innovation comes first from real people and not from producers. 

[^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation]: MIT professor Eric von Hippel, through the credible book *Democratizing Innovation*, help us to extend further an understanding that the person who lives the experiences, the needs, are often the source of innovative solutions. The work recognizes characteristics of the phenomenon where users aren't passive recipients of products and services but active agents in their creation and refinement.

On the other hand, it is the entrepreneurial role that generally takes the credit for getting things done - at least up to this point since execution matters much more than ideas given that we don't have miraculous ways to execute ideas. Therefore, it goes along that they are in the position of being thankful, or frustrated, as they are caught between two spaces. On one hand, a source space, where they take things from, like resources, the how-to things. On the other hand, the target space, where their put their creations to test and where they put their hopes. That view, although simplistic, suggests that they are a bridge and invite us to look at their challenges to solve the challenges presented from the entanglements from both sides. 











To illustrate the challenges of that unique position, we shall go back to not-so-far back-in-time and follow the life of some of the builders that had put a dent in the universe of the hail-riding experience and caused an impact to the traditional taxi industry. The advent of the iPhone, in 2007, some of them had received a calling, given by the ring that people were buying that new three-in-one device - an internet communicator system, a phone, and a music player [^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone] - as described by Steve Jobs. By 2008, they entrepreneurs were likely experiencing too other incremental development to the iPhone: an extended battery lifetime, support for the newly released 3G network which meant higher speed and better connectivity to the internet, and not to forget that the iPhone alread had a GPS support which meant for them the opportunity to make solutions that could track the location of people.

[^footnote_stevejobs_threeinone]: When introducing the iPhone (2012, June 29) during his keynote presentation at Macworld 2007, Steve Jobs famously described the device as a "three-in-one" product, integrating a phone, an iPod, and an Internet communications device. For reference, iPod had been considered a quite disruptive innovation for the need of listening to music.

These meant or them an exciting space of the building blocks for making solutions for people's phones. In other words, a source space. With the motivation that sourcing was possible, they logically turned their attention to the target space, the place where people were living their lives, which prompted them to wonder about the experience of taking rides in the major cities around the world. Logically, their intention had to do with improving the experience from an existing experience, logically at the time framed by, or defined, by existing incremental developments generally observed as characteristics of an experience provided by the taxi industry. As an example, if one wanted a ride, they could "get a cab," by making a phone call to a central. Or, when in the streets in the busy centers such as of New York, they could wave their hands to a yellow car. Or, they could walk to a specific taxi area. After entering the cab, they were in the experience as it were. I remember the day when I left my phone in a cab in San Franscisco and how comfortable I was to know that I would never see it again. In another experienced, when I were a host to my friends from Mozilla organization visiting Brazil, I caught myself taking a ride in the streets of Porto Alegre at 110 km/h afraid to ask the driver to reduce the speed while holding my hands tight and fearing a big news for the next day - The end of Mozilla project from a crash in Brazil. 

These were some elements that prompted some entrepreneurs to become that bridge and to connect these different spaces. Which took them to ask other questions: Are people really buying that expensive phone? Would it be possible to develop a solution where they could order a ride from any place by tapping the screen on their phone? Would they be able to monitor the driver approaching in the screen and how how long would it take to pick up? Would it be possible to follow the movement looking a map in real-time? And perhaps to see the fares upfront, ahead of time, before accepting the ride; or to pick the size of the car, and a lot more such as to be able to rate the driver behavior and safety aspects. The more they asked the more the bridge seemed real which took them to also ask a critical quesetion - if they were to make a solution, how easy/difficult would be for people to install that and tell others too. 

Thankfully, Apple had created a place enabling people to browse and install these solutions (apps) which were essentially a marketplace [^footnote_apple_marketplace] integrated in the phone. Basically, anyone using an iPhone could browse applications made by different companies where they could read more about who were the company behind, and able to install, and to use it. For developers, that meant a green light again, asking them to accelerate towards disrupting the old hail-riding experience, or the cab industry, or taxi industry, you name it. 

[^footnote_apple_marketplace]: In 2008, Apple Inc. launched its "App Store" which consisted of being a digital marketplace bundled with the iPhones and enabling people to download applications, apps, fundamentally changing the way software is discovered, installed which market implications in terms of distribution and monetization. 





But all of that, still, is about the visualization of the bridge and has anything to do with the getting things done. And the actual challenge that these pioneers will leave as they try to do it, as they enter the space, what brings them to say that reality is different, which we will follow with Brad Stone, of Upstarts (Stone, B., 2017). 

Moving forward to 2008, an iPhone app known as Taxi Magic was becoming popular in the U.S. as it had expanded across 25 cities, giving riders the ability to order standard taxis from their phones. That perspective shows that the strategy of Taxi Magic were essentially improving the existing situation, probably challenging some of the aspects, but essentially playing fair and in agreement to the taxi industry. On other hands, of other founders, they thought that in order for riders to have a better experience, the known situation of the hail-hailing experience needed to change. If we look at the original business presentation from Uber - Uber's original pitch deck (2017, August 23) - they point to the poor experience of ride taking as connected with the taxi monopolies.





Now that history shows that Uber survived, and given that many riders don't even know the world as it were before, can be challenging for us to see how these founders were struggling at the time. According to Brad Stone, these were philosophicaly differences. For Taxi Magic leadership, a particular moment had challenged them to reconsider their views, when Bill Gurley - the renowed partner of Benchmark Capital later to be known as the major investor in Uber - had engaged in what was referred as "a prolonged courtship" (Stone, B., 2017, p. 71) that culminated in an offer of $8 million in investment [^footnote_bradstone_investment_uber] which was declined. 

[^footnote_bradstone_investment_uber]: According to Brad Stone, the conversations between Taxi Magic and Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, had eventually arrived at an verbal offer from Bill Gurley, who proposed an $8 million investment at a $32 million valuation (Stone, B., 2017, p. 71).

@meta @todo/edit/decide 
* @todo/edit/decide - p2 ( ) - In Space / Bridging Spaces - According to Jordan Peterson it makes sense to compare ways of putting the prose. We have option A and B. Option A "In an interview given to Brad Stone, DePaschoale the then-chairman Taxi Magic, had recognized that "Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably." DePaschoale had given to us the feeling of how the perspective is felt when you are there, in the road, in front of cross-roads, where you can't embrace all and have to take a path. But given that an experienced person like De Pasquale, that were actually involved in the business that had achieved a certain level of maturity, to even use the word bet, it reveals not only the multiple potential bets in place, but that these were in fact different strategies or perspectives, as in theses, more than anything related with gambling. In other words, his phrasing that reveals a certain degree of humility, is not enough to hide the well-informed characteristizations of their strategies." And option B is "In an interview with the chairman of Taxi Magic, De Pasquale, his recognition that Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably, had much less to do with innocence or lack of professionalism and more in terms of revealing the size of the challenge they were onto. Given the experience of a professional like De Pasquale, quite involved in that business that had reached to a certain extent a level of maturity, to even use the word bet is more to do with the humbling spirit that went along the more these leaders get into the growth potential in a space where uncertainty is maintained at the proportion of the potential they unleash." / @meta-refid 1223-3321-2323-3344

In other words, his phrasing that reveals a certain degree of humility, is not enough to hide the well-informed characteristizations of their strategies. 





And that brings us to the revelation of other aspects in the struggle between the more incremental approach, which is playing by the rules, or the more disruptive approach, to provoke the space, or even the possibility of a strategy that shifts from one to the other, as in to unleash the disruptive after what seems to be the incremental; which may be particularly recognized when Bill Gurley approached De Pasquale as part of the inclinations for investments, and had advised De Pasquale to step away, initially from the taxior the "yellow cabs," as known in the U.S., positioning the service closer to the category of the "limo cars" instead, deferring the full potential for a future chapter. As we know from the history of Uber - the team that end-up receiving the investment of Bill Gurley and Benchmark Capital - were actually in that limo space, or black cars; but eventually took over and impacted the space of the general taxi experience.

That situation that appears to be a crossroad is essentially a revelation that, to a certain extent, they have to decide which way to take, how to proceed. In other words, what they are about to deliver the move they enter the space of the real world, with that something that needs to be built, has to come to terms with the necessity of being tangible, coherent, marketable, and understood by people, and accepted by the world. The metaphor of the brigde is then a step, and more than to push further the glamour, it celebrates the moment of vulnerability, like the vulnerability of a marriage that sets in. In this marriage, a proposition is for two forces, the How-to-do with the What-to-do, for the hopes that a new child is given, transformation and impact to the environment. Through that celebration, where the romantic notion is there and where love and energy are present, there is too the presence of other forces that are interested, like the forces of competition or the forces in favor; but basically everyone that is interested in what changes. From there, every single moment of materialization that follows essentially ask the question, again and again, "if anyone objects to these forces, please speak."

Next, we shall then celebrate how a notion of bundling [^foonote_bundling_old] gained significance in the modern business world as a result from the richer creations of entrepreneurship that gained distribution powers - i.e. the operating system or software systems bringing other systems together - essentially becoming platforms for delivery of values (plus other things) by exercising more direct influence in what the user is eating, or the user's plate. Thus, the observation that the whole world started to be concerned with the things "being bundled," within all things delivered to them, is in fact an effect from the fact that the business world had being busy exercising the potential of bundling things into things delivered. And likewise as an implication of that, we shall too consider the challenges since action of entrepreneurial world had too gained more dynamism by the existance of modular things - enabling entrepreneurs to bundle things quicker - which in turn sets them into challenges, exactly because things bundled from the world of entrepreneurial action is not untied from the entangled and existing world of prior things given. 

[^foonote_bundling_old]: A historical perspective about the usage of "bundling" from the past and the modern usage is given by in Bundling (2000) which elaborates about the original usage from an old courtship practice where young couples spent nights together in a single bed, either tied or "bundled" up to prevent physical intimacies; to the usage in modern business terminology where "bundling" referred to the strategy of selling multiple products or services together as a single package, offering convenience but also raising concerns about potential anti-competitive effects.
