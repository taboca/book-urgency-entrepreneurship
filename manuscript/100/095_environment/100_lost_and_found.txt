## Danger device, Hip Top and Marcio

And likewise, that this movement happens grain by grain - incrementally - or that it can be disruptive. When I moved to Silicon Valley, in the early 2000s, I used to bike to the office using a device called the *Danger Hiptop* [^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop] which could make people worried about my behavior of riding and browsing the Web at the same time. I would say that I was the first to do that in the world. But then and fast-forward 24 years, it now seems too normal that people don't even care that how the food delivery drivers in Brazil can ride and look on their smartphone screens installed in their bike's handlebar. They might be just too busy or hungry to eat their pizza. As a side note, it took me years to come up with a theory that it was their speeding - and occasionally them performing wheelies - the reason why some of the pepperoni slices would shift from their designated half to invade the Margherita space.

[^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop]: The Danger Hiptop, also known as the T-Mobile Sidekick, was a pioneering mobile device that predated the widespread emergence of contemporary smartphones. Developed by Danger, Inc., this innovative gadget was notable for its unique design, featuring a flip screen and a full QWERTY keyboard, which made it particularly popular among a younger demographic seeking a mobile device for messaging and internet browsing. One of its most forward-thinking features was its internet browser, which operated by exchanging bits and pieces of images from a remote browser, a technique that was considered ahead of its time ir not a workaround since making a full browsing in the device would be impossible.
