## @temp - kids playing 

So I hope that some of these illustrations are good for the many us that are the people that just don't get it. With that said, and yet or still, it may be so that we feel sometimes that many of these solutions are unecessary, or too much. Thus, it is unescapable too that sometimes we think of ourselves and others as victims of some experiences and to be concerned with, as if that we sometimes are in a enprisioned. These days I was concerned since I got a picture of my nieces visiting the country land: They were in a playground sat in opposite sides of the merry-go-round spinner, a mechanical equipment where kids sat around and can spin theselves by applying their force in a central plate that does not move. So they would spin fast except that both of them were watching a video on their tablet. To be fair with them, I got a photo, so maybe they were resting after having played too much, although that resting watching a tablet is yet something that concerns me. 

## @temp - walking app 

One thing to take from all that is that it turns out that we sort of seem to be living our lives and needs and running our lives on top of platform. Thus, if one lives a crazy work life she might find herself in needs for balancing out things; and it may be that she is too busy looking to the mobile screen too so for her it could make sense to install a digital application on her mobile device, one that helps her to meet other walkers since she prefers to not walk alone. And the application has other bells and whistles too like it saves the path for all her walks, it reports the total of footsteps per walk, it monitors her heart rate, and it may too give her badges, and it may too allow her to share and celebrate in the digital space with her network her achievements - yay. 

## @temp - abundance - hidration belly 

It is unescapable for many of us to first think that all that is being offered are by-products of the situation of abundance brought by the capitalist machine that is non-stop evolving and serving the needs of people in a world that is spinning faster. As an example, when I first heard about those hydration gels that a runner drinks during a marathon, I thought it were some sort of compact water, to avoid the water to be bouncing inside the belly. Then I did a bit of research when editing this and realized that it has less to do with water and it's a source of energy that is easy to consume, that it offers fast absortion, nutrients, and as well may bring some of the values from like the electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, that are lost through sweat. So my case helps us to conclude that it may be indeed that the capitalist machine is thirsty for creating all sorts of solutions and, as well, that many people just don't get it because they are not actually wearing the shoes of the ones living specific needs. 

## @temp - ridiculous - don't get it 

When we consider so different examples, we may think first that it takes a very specific reason for some people to want to mess up with their environment. Sometimes we will just don't get it how certain people create certain things. I felt at simes a feeling of judging some of the solutions, like to think how ridiculous is it for someone to be paying for a moment of silence. But now there are a lot of digital services that guide us into an experience that may have to do in a way or another with a moment of silence. Now it can be normal when you see a person that has subscribed to "an app" that helps her to have a moment of meditation. Perhaps a monk won't get it, not entirelly, although it is likely the monk is better equipped to understand the situation. But if you take a time machine and bring someone from 1885 living near a water mine, that person would not get why to pay for a cup, or a bottle or too a box of water. I still remember the yuck face my friend did around 2005 when I told him that supermarkets in the US had egg yolks in a box. 

## @temo-removed #box #input #output 

In other words, these founders had envisioned some freedom or a better experience certainly in their views which consisted in a rearrangement of an experience, essentially changing a space or a market depending how you want to see. And since we aren't judging the creations but recognizing a way to look at these environment. If we think of it as a space, we may think of the limits like  boundaries or constraints; and certainly from that the opportunities. This space, like a box, recognizes some inputs, such as to note the ground that a farmer uses to plant seeds, and also the outputs, such as that fruits can be sold to a local community. Or if another team had an idea to help people sleep, they can be grounded by a platform - like the Android platform - where they expect to deliver the experience as a smartphone "app" available to potential users through the Google marketplace, Google Play. 


## @temp-removed #uber #medallion 

Entrepreneurial function happens when its actions improves a situation where people interact or live or do the things they need to do. What it creates - by its solutions like tools or offerings - essentially does two things: It may improve the situation, when it adds something like when a new air conditioning system is proposed to improve the air quality in a coffee shop. Or, on the other hand, when it proposes a reinvention to an arrangement like when entrepreneurs refer as to "put a dent in the universe," where as an example we can recall the ideas presented by the founders of Uber where they informed their investors of a complication with the current cab situation referring as taxi-monopolies even to a point of pointing out "the medallion system" (2017, August 23) as one of the factors reducing the quality of the service.

## Danger device, Hip Top and Marcio

And likewise, that this movement happens grain by grain - incrementally - or that it can be disruptive. When I moved to Silicon Valley, in the early 2000s, I used to bike to the office using a device called the *Danger Hiptop* [^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop] which could make people worried about my behavior of riding and browsing the Web at the same time. I would say that I was the first to do that in the world. But then and fast-forward 24 years, it now seems too normal that people don't even care that how the food delivery drivers in Brazil can ride and look on their smartphone screens installed in their bike's handlebar. They might be just too busy or hungry to eat their pizza. As a side note, it took me years to come up with a theory that it was their speeding - and occasionally them performing wheelies - the reason why some of the pepperoni slices would shift from their designated half to invade the Margherita space.

[^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop]: The Danger Hiptop, also known as the T-Mobile Sidekick, was a pioneering mobile device that predated the widespread emergence of contemporary smartphones. Developed by Danger, Inc., this innovative gadget was notable for its unique design, featuring a flip screen and a full QWERTY keyboard, which made it particularly popular among a younger demographic seeking a mobile device for messaging and internet browsing. One of its most forward-thinking features was its internet browser, which operated by exchanging bits and pieces of images from a remote browser, a technique that was considered ahead of its time ir not a workaround since making a full browsing in the device would be impossible.
