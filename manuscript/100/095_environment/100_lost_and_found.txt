## @temo-removed #box #input #output 

In other words, these founders had envisioned some freedom or a better experience certainly in their views which consisted in a rearrangement of an experience, essentially changing a space or a market depending how you want to see. And since we aren't judging the creations but recognizing a way to look at these environment. If we think of it as a space, we may think of the limits like  boundaries or constraints; and certainly from that the opportunities. This space, like a box, recognizes some inputs, such as to note the ground that a farmer uses to plant seeds, and also the outputs, such as that fruits can be sold to a local community. Or if another team had an idea to help people sleep, they can be grounded by a platform - like the Android platform - where they expect to deliver the experience as a smartphone "app" available to potential users through the Google marketplace, Google Play. 

## @temp - COVID and language 

* Potentially used within Environment -> Words 

As COVID-19 were passing by, I couldn't notice if it were accelerating the adoption of a modern way of ordering at some coffee shops in Brazil. But it clearly gave me an opportunity to compare the place before and after: I would come in, seat, and ask the waiter for the menu and a coffee at once; while after the waiter came in quick and asked me to take a photo of a image on a table as the way to order from there.  

That brings us to the inescapable - and sometimes quite surprising - truth that things do stick around and change our lives. And, as well, to wonder about the supporting factors that brings these new tunes to the spaces where we live. As an example, and if I were not so hungry and paused to reflect, I would perhaps notice the complexity and the many things that needed to be in place for that simple request to work. Like the Internet that needed to be on, the necessity of a smartphone, and for it have a camera. And as for my finger is concerned, the interface means to for it to tap the camera icon in the device's screen, which would then bring another graphical interface, of the menu, with the various kinds of coffee. 

But take these technologies and platforms and interfaces aside, there is too the necessity of a language. One that guides the beginner, perhaps not unlike the language of a professional dancer that conducts the novice, such as one that says to "just take a photo of that image on your table and you will be able to order directly to the kitchen." Now if these can be seen as some characterizations of an environment, we shouldn't forget that the new tune is sustained in harmony with the movement of an economic model background, which is likely the case that influenced the owners of that coffee place to chose that modern ordering system. 

## @temp - View for optimism and the obsolete entrepreneurial function 

It is a good thing that a lot can be done and that human potential can be busy building things by using the tools and methods and frameworks and systems and networks and a lot more doing all of that with good expectations and also in harmony with others. There is that happening in the world and it is worth celebrating. And there is nothing wrong with that as the bricklayer that builds houses carries the main element of the true entrepreneurs - the ability to get things done. 

What matters for all the entrepreneurs - not matter what they the bits and pieces that they are layering - is that being aware of their environment - tools or platforms or methods or the playbooks or a marketplace or else - is important as they should understand and interpret the obvious things - like boundaries or limits and possibilities - but also the meaning for themselves and from the perspective of where they are going such as the view for the startup growth and the business in the long run. 


## @temp - Mechanic proving with specific values 

As an example of how values shift, consider a visit I did to my car's mechanic, a couple years ago when I had asked him about the potential rise of eletric cars in Brazil, whereas his reasons for why it wouldn't work were were quite informed market-oriented reasons and less to do with what could be thought of as higher values such as the environmental impact to the planet or other moral or even religious concerns. In other words, if one justifies the reality of a market to judge if something is a go-no-go then this one is likely aware of the characterizations of that market, which could be generally considered a good thing the idea that many of us understand what are markets. But as much as that idea means to be celebrating the well-informed citizen, likely supported by the wide adoption of means to access information, it also shows how the realities that we have created, such as the market realities of our environments, become new factors on our ways to set the limits for what we do. 

In other words, many of us can be satisfied by "thinking outside the box" that can be a mere exploration or a tinkering within another wider box that is not at all being challenged; which is other words is to say that a provocation to a system of values which may sound quite provoking might be about doing business as usual within another and unseen envinronmental box of values. 
Therefore, and if we are to consider how we are bounded to our environment, we shouldn't miss the celebration that the possibilities for doing things might be expanded given the abundance of possibilities offered by the platforms of our modern world; but too that such expansion is also an expansion that can take our attention. 


## @temp - creative destruction

And in matter of fact, real entrepreneurial action or more innovative the solution is, the more impactful the solution is, it is likely one that rethinks these boundaries and limits of a given space, and by rethinking it creates a new reality, which usually has ties with the development of a whole economy, and by creating a new economic model, these spaces impact social and cultural aspects, therefore creating a new space of opportunity. That essentially may touch the subject of creative destruction, if we think in more macro terms. But this idea may be applicable at any level in general, and if we are to follow on that, I would like to also bring about some considerations from the idea of bundle and non-bundle, which is essentially what entrepreneurial action does when one is in front of the consideration of the entrepreneurial opportunities in spaces.

## @temp - kids playing 

So I hope that some of these illustrations are good for the many us that are the people that just don't get it. With that said, and yet or still, it may be so that we feel sometimes that many of these solutions are unecessary, or too much. Thus, it is unescapable too that sometimes we think of ourselves and others as victims of some experiences and to be concerned with, as if that we sometimes are in a enprisioned. These days I was concerned since I got a picture of my nieces visiting the country land: They were in a playground sat in opposite sides of the merry-go-round spinner, a mechanical equipment where kids sat around and can spin theselves by applying their force in a central plate that does not move. So they would spin fast except that both of them were watching a video on their tablet. To be fair with them, I got a photo, so maybe they were resting after having played too much, although that resting watching a tablet is yet something that concerns me. 

## @temp - walking app 

One thing to take from all that is that it turns out that we sort of seem to be living our lives and needs and running our lives on top of platform. Thus, if one lives a crazy work life she might find herself in needs for balancing out things; and it may be that she is too busy looking to the mobile screen too so for her it could make sense to install a digital application on her mobile device, one that helps her to meet other walkers since she prefers to not walk alone. And the application has other bells and whistles too like it saves the path for all her walks, it reports the total of footsteps per walk, it monitors her heart rate, and it may too give her badges, and it may too allow her to share and celebrate in the digital space with her network her achievements - yay. 

## @temp - abundance - hidration belly 

It is unescapable for many of us to first think that all that is being offered are by-products of the situation of abundance brought by the capitalist machine that is non-stop evolving and serving the needs of people in a world that is spinning faster. As an example, when I first heard about those hydration gels that a runner drinks during a marathon, I thought it were some sort of compact water, to avoid the water to be bouncing inside the belly. Then I did a bit of research when editing this and realized that it has less to do with water and it's a source of energy that is easy to consume, that it offers fast absortion, nutrients, and as well may bring some of the values from like the electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, that are lost through sweat. So my case helps us to conclude that it may be indeed that the capitalist machine is thirsty for creating all sorts of solutions and, as well, that many people just don't get it because they are not actually wearing the shoes of the ones living specific needs. 

## @temp - ridiculous - don't get it 

When we consider so different examples, we may think first that it takes a very specific reason for some people to want to mess up with their environment. Sometimes we will just don't get it how certain people create certain things. I felt at simes a feeling of judging some of the solutions, like to think how ridiculous is it for someone to be paying for a moment of silence. But now there are a lot of digital services that guide us into an experience that may have to do in a way or another with a moment of silence. Now it can be normal when you see a person that has subscribed to "an app" that helps her to have a moment of meditation. Perhaps a monk won't get it, not entirelly, although it is likely the monk is better equipped to understand the situation. But if you take a time machine and bring someone from 1885 living near a water mine, that person would not get why to pay for a cup, or a bottle or too a box of water. I still remember the yuck face my friend did around 2005 when I told him that supermarkets in the US had egg yolks in a box. 


## @temp-removed #uber #medallion 

Entrepreneurial function happens when its actions improves a situation where people interact or live or do the things they need to do. What it creates - by its solutions like tools or offerings - essentially does two things: It may improve the situation, when it adds something like when a new air conditioning system is proposed to improve the air quality in a coffee shop. Or, on the other hand, when it proposes a reinvention to an arrangement like when entrepreneurs refer as to "put a dent in the universe," where as an example we can recall the ideas presented by the founders of Uber where they informed their investors of a complication with the current cab situation referring as taxi-monopolies even to a point of pointing out "the medallion system" (2017, August 23) as one of the factors reducing the quality of the service.

## Danger device, Hip Top and Marcio

And likewise, that this movement happens grain by grain - incrementally - or that it can be disruptive. When I moved to Silicon Valley, in the early 2000s, I used to bike to the office using a device called the *Danger Hiptop* [^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop] which could make people worried about my behavior of riding and browsing the Web at the same time. I would say that I was the first to do that in the world. But then and fast-forward 24 years, it now seems too normal that people don't even care that how the food delivery drivers in Brazil can ride and look on their smartphone screens installed in their bike's handlebar. They might be just too busy or hungry to eat their pizza. As a side note, it took me years to come up with a theory that it was their speeding - and occasionally them performing wheelies - the reason why some of the pepperoni slices would shift from their designated half to invade the Margherita space.

[^footnote_technology_dangerhiptop]: The Danger Hiptop, also known as the T-Mobile Sidekick, was a pioneering mobile device that predated the widespread emergence of contemporary smartphones. Developed by Danger, Inc., this innovative gadget was notable for its unique design, featuring a flip screen and a full QWERTY keyboard, which made it particularly popular among a younger demographic seeking a mobile device for messaging and internet browsing. One of its most forward-thinking features was its internet browser, which operated by exchanging bits and pieces of images from a remote browser, a technique that was considered ahead of its time ir not a workaround since making a full browsing in the device would be impossible.
