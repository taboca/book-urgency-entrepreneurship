# Environment 

Entreprenurship happens in the environment and because of the environment. This makes the environment of entrepreneurs, especially when it creates the demand which happens when one feels that they need to do something, like to put a dent in the universe as they would say. Think about category products - 

Situation - all entrepreneurs change something in the world, in the external. 
Complication - what makes them to want to do X and not Y? Why they care? As they do, they do too get to be surprised by the surprises of the environment. They get to see something more of the world, and into the idea that the world is not what they tought. 
Answer - Let's consider how the space for entrepreneurship is formed, it's real and not real, and how all is platform; 
Answer - Let's consider how all interfaces extensions of everyone involved and how an interface is a state of a tool and how it helps to reinforce the space. 
ANswer - Let's dive to reflect about how words are too part of the interfaces, and how narratives can be real or creations too.

## It's a space 





It used to be and sometimes it still is, at least for me, ridiculous to be paying for a moment of silence. But now there are a lot of digital services that guide us into an experience that may have to do in a way or another with a moment of silence. Now it can be normal when you see a person that has subscribed to "an app" that helps her to have a moment of meditation. Perhaps a monk won't get it, not entirelly, although it is likely the monk is better equipped to understand the situation. But if you take a time machine and bring someone from 1885 living near a water mine, that person would not get why to pay for a cup, or a bottle or too a box of water. I still remember the yuck face my friend did around 2005 when I told him that supermarkets in the US had egg yolks in a box. 

It is unescapable for many of us to first think that all that is being offered are by-products of the situation of abundance brought by the capitalist machine that is non-stop evolving and serving the needs of people in a world that is spinning faster. As an example, when I first heard about those hydration gels that a runner drinks during a marathon, I thought it were some sort of compact water, to avoid the water to be bouncing inside the belly. Then I did a bit of research when editing this and realized that it has less to do with water and it's a source of energy that is easy to consume, that it offers fast absortion, nutrients, and as well may bring some of the values from like the electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, that are lost through sweat. So my case helps us to conclude that it may be indeed that the capitalist machine is thirsty for creating all sorts of solutions and, as well, that many people just don't get it because they are not actually wearing the shoes of the ones living specific needs.

One thing to take from all that is that it turns out that we sort of seem to be living our lives and needs and running our lives on top of platform. Thus, if one lives a crazy work life she might find herself in needs for balancing out things; and it may be that she is too busy looking to the mobile screen too so for her it could make sense to install a digital application on her mobile device, one that helps her to meet other walkers since she prefers to not walk alone. And the application has other bells and whistles too like it saves the path for all her walks, it reports the total of footsteps per walk, it monitors her heart rate, and it may too give her badges, and it may too allow her to share and celebrate in the digital space with her network her achievements - yay. 

So I hope that some of these illustrations are good for the many us that are the people that just don't get it. With that said, and yet or still, it may be so that we feel sometimes that many of these solutions are unecessary, or too much. These days I was concerned since I got a picture of my nieces visiting the country land: They were in a playground sat in opposite sides of the merry-go-round spinner, a mechanical equipment where kids sat around and can spin theselves by applying their force in a central plate that does not move. So they would spin fast except that both of them were using their tablet. To be fair with them, I got a photo. Maybe they were resting after having played too much, although that resting watching a tablet is yet something that confuses me. 

But when I give more fire to that feeling of discomfort, that something is wrong, it takes me too to the idea that people, I will call them now users, can be in a way trapped in the platform; or enprisioned by the interactions of that situational in a given platform likely being experienced by a group. I will soon go back to the digital situation and the complication of systems - and networks and tools - but let us think of the traffic situation to start with, of how many people are stuck in traffic. It certainly brings me to celebrate the existance of the car's air conditioner if the location is hot. And the car music player and the need for comfortable seats. These are things that makes the experience of being stuck to be much better. Celebrating a nice car - and its whistles and bells - stuck in the traffic should also set us to celebrate the cup holder, which would well accomodate a milkshake. And if the driver is a business manager he will may be interested to recall the reflections from Clayton Christensen, the renowned Harvard Business School professor also known for the book *The Innovator's Dilemma*, that had developed the beginnings of the idea that we essentially hire products to do a job for us, that we are essentially seeking for solutions to help our ways to get a job done. Consider the narrative given by professor Clayton and his colleagues, where a researcher interviews commuters and understands better the intents of some commuters for when they bring milkshake to their cars: 

> *The researcher inquired further: “Tell me about a time when you were in the same situation but you didn’t buy a milk shake. What did you buy instead?” Sometimes, he learned, they bought a bagel. But bagels were too dry. Bagels with cream cheese or jam resulted in sticky fingers and gooey steering wheels. Sometimes these commuters bought a banana, but it didn’t last long enough to solve the boring-commute problem. Doughnuts didn’t carry people past the 10 am hunger attack. The milk shake, it turned out, did the job better than any of these competitors. It took people 20 minutes to suck the viscous milk shake through the thin straw, addressing the boring-commute problem. They could consume it cleanly with one hand. By 10:00, they felt less hungry than when they tried the alternatives. It didn’t matter much that it wasn’t a healthy food, because becoming healthy wasn’t essential to the job they were hiring the milk shake to do.*" (Christensen, Cook, & Hall, 2005)

Consider, for example, entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley v5 days, the activities and how the industry sets an environment for founders and the general workforce to likely continue to turn the same wheel. Sam Altman wrote an article where he is concerned with a situation, like voices, or the lack of voices, in Silicon Valley and the risk for the innovation potential: 

> *"More recently, I’ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for intelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension leave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so toxic. “If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical” was a memorable quote I heard this year."* Sam Altman, https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

He also had considered: 

> *"Political correctness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage."* Sam Altman,  https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

There is then a dilemma, to explore or live "of the land." Therefore, on one hand, we might exercise the potential within the space, as in one that becomes expert in the survival in the jungle where they live, therefore they can be somebody playing by the rules. On the other hand, one can be caught in a situation of - or in need of - breaking the rules of a setting, inspired and motivated to reclaim the space under new terms, to rethink the nature of what happens in the space. 

So we either want to succeed within the box or without the box, assuming the entrepreneurial situation where "breaking the box" means that a greater good is given to many involved - or new rules for a better social context. This idea of in or without the box, although can be seen from this general perspective, connects with a famous line from Jim Barksdale from the days when he was the CEO of Netscape [^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]. In an interview by Justin Fox, for Harvard Business Review (Fox, 2014), Jim Barksdale indicated that the line came about during Netscape's public offering roadshow. Jim found himself at the Savoy Hotel in London, pressed for time and facing a room full of British investment bankers. When questioned about Microsoft's potential to bundle a browser into their product, “How do you know that Microsoft isn’t just going to bundle a browser into their product?” he made a statement that would later become an essential business principle: "Gentlemen, there’s only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling." His comment was less a carefully crafted strategy and more a pragmatic observation about the cycles of adding and subtracting features or services in a way that adds value to users and where a business model might happen. 

[^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]: The idea of bundle and unbundle is generally promoted by Marc Andreessen, one of the creators of the first popular internet browser that co-founder of Netscape. Marc is a well-known investor and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, A16z, an iconic venture capital firm from Silicon Valley.

### The experience of a platform inside a platform





My experience with this idea of platforms, and the bundling and unbundling of platforms, I would call a stack of platforms. It started to form precisely in my mind a long time ago when I got my first computer around 1985. These were the days when video games existed already, and it was all exciting, but we basically had no way to create the games or to modify the games ourselves. One could only dream and wonder about how these things were made, of course excited about the possibility that it could change the characters or change the colors of the background and anything. But then soon my father brought her personal computer, a quite different box, that also had games in it, and an interface that would actually invite us to do this kind of custom works, to actually create software systems, perhaps to create games. So that was when I met what people call, what technical people call the operating system, and other tools like the programming languages. These would be the doors inviting me to enter that world of change where things could be built. Needless to say, I took the computer as the thing that enabled the development of games, so I wanted to build one for myself. But it turned out that the programming languages that I was using were quite basic or limited. It was when I learned that good games were written in a more complex language, programming language or interface, what the technical people would call the machine language, and I had no pointers or books to understand that part. So I tried to do something more simple, and since I like to draw, I tried to make a software for drawing, known at this time as the graphics editor. Although that seemed simpler, and I went quite further, I caught myself again feeling to be using limited tools, and I couldn't really make that graphics software how I wanted. I actually learned that if I wanted to do graphics software, I had to, again, approach that language called the machine language. So I had to continue to be feeling like somebody, and it was when I caught myself writing solutions for the adult worlds, like software applications. Those were simple. Then I felt like being somebody in the world of adults as well, even to be a teacher for some of them about the programming languages to make applications for adults.

One lesson was that the language which I tried to make games, or complex things like a graphics editor, were actually more suitable to basic software. That was a platform, had the right things to do, like rules or limits. But I was somebody and doing commercial systems helped me to even make money. Fast-forward 14 years, I caught myself in a Computer Science course and a lot in the labs, doing 3D animation selling video animations, mostly short forms of video commercials for small local companies, which was a possibility given by a popular software for creating 3d models and animations. At that time I also had the chance to start using the Web and understood that the browser - Netscape Communicator - was a tool for visiting web pages but also for making them. So, on top of the computer of the 1990s, I had an operating system and an Internet navigation software which had rules, or limits, for creating web pages. 

Now, if we look at the situation of how a role of the web developer [^footnote_marcio_web_developer] happened to be designed from the usage of browser, which helps us to consider the bunble/unblundle notions of Jim Barksdale and Marc Andreessen; and the rise of this and other professional positions, or identities, which didn't exist before the early 90s. But in the beginning of the 90s, web developers were just a few of them. They started as webmasters when sites came out. They were the people that would take care of websites, and they had to be concerned with the user, the visitor, to care about the visitors. They had to be valuing layout and aspects of accessibility, since the web pages were actually a medium for accessing information. They had to be concerned with communication as well, because most web pages were text and graphics, and they weren't really full software programmers. On the aspect of the tool, on the other hand, it's valid to consider that the internet browser, such as the Netscape Navigator, became a bundled toolbox, made of the unbundling of prior technologies and tools, enabling that new kind of, I wouldn't say software engineer. Today, for far too many cities in the world, there are web developers everywhere and even many variations such as front-end engineers, back-end engineers, web designers, user experience designers, and a lot more. Thus, it is unescapable that they made themselves and the ties with the economic model. 

[^footnote_marcio_web_developer]: The web developer, formed after the Internet browser enabled organizations to make sites and software systems available through web browsers. The web developer would then become a worker for the medium of the Web. https://hackernoon.com/the-history-of-web-developers-tied-to-browser-development

But to summarize and go back to the platform inside the platform, these web developers happened to work and play on their space that depends on an internet browser, such as Netscape Navigator in the beginnings, the bundled innovative product create by Netscape Communications. That product, in turn, would run on top of an operating system, any user had recognized that especially in the days that the browser was not bundled in the operating system and was installed apart. But if we keep on zooming out to look at the browser product and the operating syste product, we would then recognize that the browser product were written by others roles. I was there at Netscape and had the opportunity to witness the many engineers working in the browser product to make that a reality. These were creative and experienced software developers able to create complex software that would run, as we say, "on top" of an operating system like Windows or Linux. And if you continue to zoom out, we could consider that the operating system, like Windows, would be then a sorf of platform that also runs "on top" of another platform archicture, like the computer. And although a lot of elements makes a computer, just like a car has a lot beyond its engine, we may simplify for now to think that the computer's underlying element is the CPU, which can generally be know as the computer processor. And if we lock in our zoom to the level of the processor but we shift the angle, back to the businesses bundling these solutions, we will innevitable have to celebrate the iconic Silicon Valley company, Intel, that brought to these machines the Intel processors. 

And if we continue to do this and zoom out, on zoom in depending on how you frame the situation, it is unescapable, especially if we ask what these computer chips where made of, to find the essential element of microprocessors, the transistors. And so and if we lock at the transistor level and shift ourselves to from historical perspective and rewind a few chapters in the history of Silicon Valley, we would find an opportunity to witness when Shockley Semiconductor were founded by the co-inventor of the transistor in the beautiful Santa Clara Valley, a region know at the time for an agriculture producing orchards, apricots, prunes, cherries, plums, and more. I have asked an AI tool to check history by asking "Was Shockley that went to the bay area to live with his mother?" to which the tool replied: 

> *"Yes, William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor and Nobel Prize laureate, moved to the Bay Area, specifically Mountain View, California, in 1956 to be closer to his ailing mother. This move was significant because it led to the establishment of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, the first semiconductor company in the place that would be later known as Silicon Valley. Shockley's decision to relocate there and start his semiconductor company played a crucial role in the development of Silicon Valley as a major hub for high-tech innovation and development."* ChatGPT, 2024. 

Looking from the development of the organizations from the Shockley days to Intel days, we will see a lot of bundle/unbundle effects happening throghout Silicon Valley at many levels, not only from the technological. Digging history to consider how Intel came into existance, we will find that its founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, had priourly founded the then well-known Fairchild Semiconductor that according to *Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley* Intel was one among the other 126 spin-off companies also known as Fairchildren.

--> 

From a managerial perspective, if we rewind to examine the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor, we find that the same individuals who founded Intel, Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, were also known as part of "the Traitorous Eight." [^footnote_trairorous_eight] The history behind the Traitorous Eight, is an invitation for us to consider how the phenomenon of unbundling is entangled with technology, management, and culture: 

[^footnote_trairorous_eight]: The "Traitorous Eight" refers to the eight engineers and scientists who left Shockley Semiconductor due to dissatisfaction with management. They were Gordon Moore, C. Sheldon Roberts, Eugene Kleiner, Robert Noyce, Victor Grinich, Julius Blank, Jean Hoerni and Jay Last; and founded Fairchild Semiconductor; which opens our minds to consider how the idea of leaving a company, and with it its management practices and culture, were connected to the needs of a market in development. 

Shockley was brilliant but not seen as a good manager from the views of his colleagues, especially for eight of them that left Shockley and founded Fairchild Semiconductor. Keep in mind that in 1957 the idea of an employee leaving a company were considered as wrong. According to Wikipedia (2024), "Shockley described their leaving as a 'betrayal'." From the perspective of these eight, on the other hand, these were a shift in the managerial practices that were in front of the opportunity.

Now, after us having considered that Shockley had produced Fairchild that had produced 126 others, it is then unescapable to consider that the event, the Traitorous Eight, had an impact in influencing the views such as views of leaving things behind, inclinations to be open to new management and cultural aspects as part of a potential industry, and the like. In other words, when Shockley have accused them of being "traitors," he may have accelerated the process. Now, let us consider what would be the mindset of the people working at Fairchild after the fact that the founding event had ties with the idea of founders leaving a bad management behind. Consider how the mindset of Fairchild would then produce new employees which would not fear at all to create their own companies such as the 126 new entities according to the Fairchild Genealogy [^footnote_fairchild].

[^footnote_fairchild]: According to Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley Fairchild Genealogy (2016, December 20), a published print known as Fairchild Genealogy chart from 1986 included 126 semiconductor companies that were traced directly to Fairchild.

And moving forward to the Intel days but keeping up with what management wants, we can than celebrate the writings of Andy Grove, Intel first hire that later became CEO, such as his reflections that led to the writing of High Output Management. While High Output Management has produced direct impact to a lot of other managers that had improved the management with so many Silicon Valley companies, it is also telling us of the managerial transformation and how quick these new managers had to do something such as to create the kind of environment where people would want to work such as to be wanting to say in the face of so many opportunities knocking on their doors. 







Then the complication really comes from the potential and the network. Doing something on the bundled platform, platforming adding to it. Or reconsidering the platform, reinventing. The complication is that the platform becomes your terrain, where all happens, like a playground. But something like the Web, such a playground. Or consider the popular platforms for producing "apps" for mobile devices, Google Play or the Apple Store. Developers become the builders on top of those, a community around the methods for building, discussions on top of, on top of the opportunities. The world wants a forward-movement and when there is potential and growth, there is stickyness for the forwardness, to comply with. A whole industry. 

All these are networks, thus the platform potential lies ni deed in the network. When locomotives came along in the US, as Maury Klein has documented, it was scary to see the potential (of the network). We can celebrate that by the examination of the post written by a school in the north of US: 

> *""* Maury Klein, Power Makers 

But once a network becomes an ecosystem, then it boosts people to run interactions that are supportive of an economy, doesn't it? Consider any network, such as Craigslist, or even Facebook. 

We know, from theory of innocation, that breaking rules seem to be part of the equation in the sense of seeking freedom. As an example, consider the network of "yellow cabs" and the situation that gave rise to Uber. Not easy, to break the membrane of a network, it's like a social gut system perhaps, like a living ecosystem of bacteria and all sorts of things happening. Quite stable, a sort of colony, that we get used to. But then some people might get mad about its rules, others want to be somebody, or stumble in new ideas out of the interactions, needs.

### Unbundling the platform 





We if look at the situation with Uber' story, I was a driver for 1000 trips. Perhaps as I was a part-time driver, not being 100% inside at it, I could bend its reality, a little and in my own way, very softly. I started doing on Fridays, and first my goal was to understand the rules "of the game" how the network works, thus I could exercise the idea of being somebody there, as a driver. I had to fight my fears, to put my mother's car in the streets, and my own fears such as driving into difficult streets, not being a good driver, and a lot more. When I came back that first day, I vividly remember, I sat on the couch but on it's arm with my feet on the couch, happy, telling my parents. Later happy for being a 5-star driver, or 4.9 one. Thus a lot of elements where in there, creating a platform for myself, to be someone, to make money too, where I could use some skills, could go towards been better as a driver, as a person, and get grades, and model my profile. End up with 1000 trips, good memories, and great stories too. 

One of the them was when I took a pregnant woman - she said it was close, last that was false alarm, when she was with her sister. This time, again, she was alone. I asked her - should I pass the red lights? She said no, please don't. Later I told her that we were next to the hospital X, Beneficiência Portuguesa, and she got scared and screamed "No, wrong hospital" to which I figured I confused the name and told here we were are going to the correct destination, and then she arrived safely. 

So I was there, also helping people, therefore not likely in a condition of urgency that would set me to perform in certain metrics, such as performance for money, which gave me experiences, to first see things that could be improved on top of the platform. That reflection was likely related to checking the limits of the bundled reality, like semi-unbundling, the sort of activities that users do, such as lead users [^footnote_lead_users] for when they are in it not trying to unbundle all but intended to support what is bundled, to evolve it. That sort of exposue can take some users to be considered as special, since they co-create the future of platforms, or can even give people jobs too. 

[^footnote_lead_users]: 

The situation I reflected was of the problems of the first trip, which involved the recognition of the fears that I went through, so I have envisioned that Uber could do a lot better to help one driver to reduce its fears. After the feelings of fears, the struggles, I caught myself later receiving an idea from a friend that became a driver. Since he knew that I was an entrepreneur, he called me asking me to make a simulation app for a first Uber trip — one that could create a fictitious trip in the streets. As I reflected about the aspects that apps could teach us in simulated environment [^footnote_uber_first_trip], it was interesting to the recognition of the problem by Ed Baker, a former Head of Product and VP of Growth at Uber: 

[^footnote_uber_first_trip]: https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc 

> *“For me, it was eye-opening when I did my first trip as a driver. I walked out to my car, I have done everything, I was activated. I walked out to my car [and] I walked back to my house because I got so nervous about doing that first trip.”*

-->

Another sort of opportunity I crossed, although it seemed a bit outside the boundaries of Uber, was what I have named "Uber-idle university" [^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university] which explored an opportunity for learning as I have replaced the arbitrary with talks, Youtube lectures saved as mp3. To make the experience good, I also had to workout certain roadblocks, such as to curate a list of 3-5 talks before the day trips, and to come up with a saying for the passengers, giving them the option to talk with me or let me study what I called "Entrepreneurship lessons in English". Most passengers supported and even encouraged me. 

[^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university]: Marcio S Galli's article "Uber-idle University," published in Ascent Publication on December 2, 2017, delves into the concept of turning idle time into educational opportunities, particularly while performing tasks that don't require full cognitive engagement, such as driving for Uber. Galli, an entrepreneur who drives part-time for Uber, argues that much of the time spent in the car can be repurposed for learning by listening to talks, podcasts, or lectures on a pen drive. He distinguishes between "distractions" and "pauses," suggesting that Uber-related interruptions merely pause his educational experience rather than derail it. The article also highlights how the nature of listening fosters deeper engagement with the content, facilitating opportunities for reflection and understanding. Galli concludes by noting that this practice has led him to be more involved in helping startups, including his own. This article reflects a broader interest in finding innovative ways to incorporate learning into daily routines, a concept that has been especially relevant in the gig economy where traditional work hours are often disrupted. https://medium.com/the-ascent/uber-idle-university-5af317b550d9

### Bundle and unblundle growth forces 





Now, as we go back to the space for innovation, it seems that the celebration of the platform, when a network in a state of virtuous growth, which seems to go along with aspects indivated in the approach for scaling of Blitzscaling. From the standpoint of growth, and the view from inverstors interested in scaling platform networks, the analysis is for what elements neeed to be in the place, what forces are fovaourable or against, considering the expectations and vision of the network reaching its full potential. In the story of Uber, a prior network was know as the "yellow cabs" situation. Sequoia partners doing analysis, wanted to invest but to recognize the risks and take a strategy of focusing first in black cars. Sequoia has identified players that were in the field of unbundling the cabs networks, and one of them had the opportunity, although Sequoia wanted them to go back to black, stay away from yellow cabs at that moment. The CEO didn't accept. Later Sequoia end up finding an entrepreneur from San Francisco that were focusing in the black cards and asked if he would be okay with the moving on top of yellow cabs in the right time. And that became Uber. 

Another story, that shows how risks are taken in consideration when the matter are networks, is shown in the story of Linkedin [^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen] where the founders have documented aspects of the struggle to understand when and how to monetize the network. They indicate that some other social networks here real competitors but some of them wanted to make revenue ahead of time, while LinkedIn had a strategy to cover at least USA as a metric for its success with its main customer, corporations looking to hire people. 

[^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen]: 

These situations show intended efforts that seeks a readiness level for the network to be bundled. This is like showing that the curation of the platform, analysis for its future potential, is a must. VC partners of great VC organizations, such as Sequoia, Greylock and A16Z, are examples that show an intended analysis of how networks operate and the risks of scaling. In a way, the body of knowledge from these groups are able to bend reality, from a view from outside. 

But now, back to individuals anr the struggles of entrepreneurs, all of that tell us that stability in the platform produces ooportunities. Or a great platform with network potential involves offering opportunities in a stable matter, the ground for an economic model or interaction that produces value. Which comes after that the aspects which I refered as the prison. 

A complication is that we can be somebody in many of these platform systems, but the experience of being somebody, especially when we are driven by certain metrics, such as performance in attributes such as score, or grades, or money, can also prevent us from seeing opportunities, expect the condition of the exercise of the attempt to maximize effienncy in the network boils back to the situation of feedback that enriches the network. But the point I want to focus now is when being busy can also come with estability of the individual in the network. 

An additional complication is when we are trapped ny many layers. Like consider a phase of a computer game, a game that is more like an experience available in a world that supports games, a network platform for games, and that the game was written on top of an operating system that runs on top of a computer system. 

If the producer of the game experience decides to shut down its servers, impact is first perceived by the network of users experiencing that experience. For them, out of the sudden, the network seems to be down, but they might figure later that the developer-owner gave up. For some, sadness might take place as part of who they are were being exercised in the game environment, through an user profile. 

But when just playing the game, before the incident, it would indeed be quite difficult for one to bend the reality expect if by any chance you had another agenda that could give you the means to see reality from different viewpoint. We should note that while estabily in the platform exists, which pushes me to keep referring it as a prison, the opportunity for freedom is exercised by the users themselves, as each one might live an agenda and their needs can also take them to become creative, from sending suggestions to more deeper reflective experiences. Author Eric von Hippel, in Democratizing Innovation [^foonote_eric_von_hippel_democratizing_innovation], offers a great perspective about how users might become co-creators with producers.

Now, there are then the improvements within the realm, the hackers, and the ones that might reconsider the whole experience. Thus, we can assert about layers within the platform, and as humans as humans, they could be exposed to deeper reflections about the realities of all these layers that they be me acting in, or even the actual reflections for the ultimate layers which we decided to anchor ourselves in - such as the case of Albert Einstein.

In the realm of innovative products or services, for example, the notion of category design, as indicated by Play Bigger author Christopher Lochhead [^footnote_play_bigger], exposes elements involved for then new categories of products and services are evident.

### Who owns the truth 





Now, in the heated/cold space of one that lives the experience, it comes the considerations of experiencing that put us to reflect, go seek for truths, challenge the boundaries. When I had reflected about that my first trip as an Uber driver, I took me into writing an article because I considered that the platform could do something about something I saw, a need. Since I had an agenda for reusing the car radio to support my goal of watching talks, I had the opportunity to visualize that Uber-idle University idea. 

Some of these extended experiences can be suggested by platforms too. Consider a Yoga program that guides its participants into the levels of reflections, adding value to the experience. Another example, which I learned from my partner, was a situation of a dance program referred as bio dance, where she has acknowledged that she has reached a level of reflective state about her experience, brought up meaning, as in philosophical reflections which were relevant to others as their dance experience involved a guided experienced with well designed exercises to put the participants in the right spot to reflect. Another example might happen in the situation of reading Harry Potter, as indicated by Kasper ter Kuile the author of The Power of Rituals. Kasper has indicated that the experience from reading Harry Potter has components that brings up a connection with the self, with truths, and life situations, such as to a point of people organize themselves to reflect and discuss about what they experience as they read. The point here to make is that certain experiences might more or less push us towards the reflective interactions about our direct needs vs. internal needs and reflectinve interactions might enable us to explore the limits of the experience too. 

Robert McKee talks about truth and the necessity, for a storyteller, to bring out truth through stories. This same idea might be applicable to entrepreneurship because there is that idea that good ideas and solutions are liberating, that unbundle reality as we know it, and bundles a new reality.

To illustrate the situation, consider the case of a school, referred by Maury Klein in Power Makers, that wrote a post indicating that if God wanted locomotives he would have made humans with locomotive faces. Which shows that whoever wanted to be against locomotives had their own believes about an underlying truth. Conversely, the promoters of locomotives had their own reasons, and values, to promote that as the future. 

Another, anedoctal situation, more of the life in the kitchen, would be the situation that Marcio has identified of the advertisements of one popular convection oven. They would promote as able to fry things with no oil, which seemed great. But also another truth in it is that it would be the best when "frying" oily things



Now, these considerations for entrepreneurs for minimally consider the reflections on living their identities as somebody, on a platform, for leaving too, for reflecting outside. These exercises of writing, enable us to break the flow, sort of to get out from the autopilot was of flowing, acting. Julia Cameron uses methods of writing, with her prompts through articles, as a means for guiding potential writers outside the zone of writers block.
