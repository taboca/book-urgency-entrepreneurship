# Environment 




Entreprenurship happens in the environment and because of the environment. This makes the environment of entrepreneurs, especially when it creates the demand which happens when one feels that they need to do something, like to put a dent in the universe as they would say. Think about category products - 

Situation - all entrepreneurs change something in the world, in the external. 
Complication - what makes them to want to do X and not Y? Why they care? As they do, they do too get to be surprised by the surprises of the environment. They get to see something more of the world, and into the idea that the world is not what they tought. 
Answer - Let's consider how the space for entrepreneurship is formed, it's real and not real, and how all is platform; 
Answer - Let's consider how all interfaces extensions of everyone involved and how an interface is a state of a tool and how it helps to reinforce the space. 
ANswer - Let's dive to reflect about how words are too part of the interfaces, and how narratives can be real or creations too.

## It's a space 





It used to be and sometimes it still is, at least for me, ridiculous to be paying for a moment of silence. But now there are a lot of digital services that guide us into an experience that may have to do in a way or another with a moment of silence. Now it can be normal when you see a person that has subscribed to "an app" that helps her to have a moment of meditation. Perhaps a monk won't get it, not entirelly, although it is likely the monk is better equipped to understand the situation. But if you take a time machine and bring someone from 1885 living near a water mine, that person would not get why to pay for a cup, or a bottle or too a box of water. I still remember the yuck face my friend did around 2005 when I told him that supermarkets in the US had egg yolks in a box. 

It is unescapable for many of us to first think that all that is being offered are by-products of the situation of abundance brought by the capitalist machine that is non-stop evolving and serving the needs of people in a world that is spinning faster. As an example, when I first heard about those hydration gels that a runner drinks during a marathon, I thought it were some sort of compact water, to avoid the water to be bouncing inside the belly. Then I did a bit of research when editing this and realized that it has less to do with water and it's a source of energy that is easy to consume, that it offers fast absortion, nutrients, and as well may bring some of the values from like the electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, that are lost through sweat. So my case helps us to conclude that it may be indeed that the capitalist machine is thirsty for creating all sorts of solutions and, as well, that many people just don't get it because they are not actually wearing the shoes of the ones living specific needs.

One thing to take from all that is that it turns out that we sort of seem to be living our lives and needs and running our lives on top of platform. Thus, if one lives a crazy work life she might find herself in needs for balancing out things; and it may be that she is too busy looking to the mobile screen too so for her it could make sense to install a digital application on her mobile device, one that helps her to meet other walkers since she prefers to not walk alone. And the application has other bells and whistles too like it saves the path for all her walks, it reports the total of footsteps per walk, it monitors her heart rate, and it may too give her badges, and it may too allow her to share and celebrate in the digital space with her network her achievements - yay. 

So I hope that some of these illustrations are good for the many us that are the people that just don't get it. With that said, and yet or still, it may be so that we feel sometimes that many of these solutions are unecessary, or too much. Thus, it is unescapable too that sometimes we think of ourselves and others as victims of some experiences and to be concerned with, as if that we sometimes are in a enprisioned. These days I was concerned since I got a picture of my nieces visiting the country land: They were in a playground sat in opposite sides of the merry-go-round spinner, a mechanical equipment where kids sat around and can spin theselves by applying their force in a central plate that does not move. So they would spin fast except that both of them were watching a video on their tablet. To be fair with them, I got a photo, so maybe they were resting after having played too much, although that resting watching a tablet is yet something that concerns me.

@outline 
* Outline - Complication - Entrepreneurship can be trapped in the space.  
--> 










And to be clear about the points for us entrepreneurs, the complications for us, is that we can be trapped too; we may be looking at solving things within a car, but other entreprenurs might be looking at if the car is really needed. In other words, as entrepreneurs look at spaces, an envinronmnt, they look at an objective reality indeed - they will find people and needs; but it is not easy to look objectively beyond the boundaries, especially given that a lot of what we do are assumptions that we need to do. To point how far this concern can go, consider the concerns from Sam Altman wrote an article where he is concerned with a situation, like voices, or the lack of voices, in Silicon Valley and the risk for the innovation potential: 

> *"More recently, I’ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for intelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension leave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so toxic. “If people live a lot longer it will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be really unethical” was a memorable quote I heard this year."* Sam Altman, https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

He also had considered: 

> *"Political correctness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage."* Sam Altman,  https://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove

So then the situation given by this idea of the zoom level shows a dilemma. That we can be looking inside the box, as in to consider that people are living of the land which is essentially us to be exercising the potential within the space for optimizations and the questions to people and users are in a way considering that people are playing by the rules. On the other hand, one can be caught in a situation of - or in need of - breaking the rules of a setting, of the space, inspired and motivated to reclaim the space under new terms, to rethink the nature of what happens in the space. 








<!-- 
@outline @meta
* @outline - Answer - has to do with the notion of bundle and unbundle - for the spaces
--> 


When we are entrepreneuring ourselves we are essentially reconsidering the boundaries of a space, so we might be exploring optimizing a given space or all the way into breaking the walls of that space. For some, they may add comfort to that space. For others, they may see a space as a prison and may want to break the walls, to free people. For us here and now it matters more to increase our views for how relative all things are. 






So we either want to succeed within the box or without the box, assuming the entrepreneurial situation where "breaking the box" means that a greater good is given to many involved - or new rules for a better social context. This idea of in or without the box, although can be seen from this general perspective, connects with a famous line from Jim Barksdale from the days when he was the CEO of Netscape [^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]. In an interview by Justin Fox, for Harvard Business Review (Fox, 2014), Jim Barksdale indicated that the line came about during Netscape's public offering roadshow. Jim found himself at the Savoy Hotel in London, pressed for time and facing a room full of British investment bankers. When questioned about Microsoft's potential to bundle a browser into their product, “How do you know that Microsoft isn’t just going to bundle a browser into their product?” he made a statement that would later become an essential business principle: "Gentlemen, there’s only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling." His comment was less a carefully crafted strategy and more a pragmatic observation about the cycles of adding and subtracting features or services in a way that adds value to users and where a business model might happen. 

[^footnote_marc_andreessen_jimbarksdale]: The idea of bundle and unbundle is generally promoted by Marc Andreessen, one of the creators of the first popular internet browser that co-founder of Netscape. Marc is a well-known investor and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, A16z, an iconic venture capital firm from Silicon Valley.

As we explore the spaces that entrepreneurship acts, either to support or enhance or either to rethink the space, let us go through an illustration and considerations using the history of Silicon Valley to explore how platforms are formed and how platforms are nested too; an exercise for us to help see that all platforms, or spaces, are relative, and how platforms may depend on platforms too. Following, let us consider that within certain platforms the users are doing things, solving their needs, so we will reflect on the relationship with the user that actss in a space and how innovation rises from within, as users seek improvements to what they do if not freedom from the situation they seem themselves. And finally, we will close this section with a reflection and conclusion about other forces that will support/prevent us from exploring the opportunities and a conclusion about who owns the space or the truth.

### Bundling the space 




When entrepreneurial action leads to innovation, it happens because it changes something in a given space - an environment, physical or a digital space, like a platform. In this section, we will consider the relativeness of all spaces and how the environment that we see is a projected reality. The reason that this matter to us is that if all spaces works like the ground for any groundwork - like the ground where a farmer plants a seed and grow an apple tree - then the understanding of its relativeness allow us to respect or celebrate that someone, or something, has control of the space and with that we invited to consider that what entrepreneurs do can indeed play by the rules of a given space or to deny the rules of it. In the farmer illustration this would be about saying that someone controls the weather or the ground conditions or the quality of the water. But of course, it will be easier for us to consider the relativenes of spaces if we consider the spaces that people have created in the first place instead to wonder about what controls the weather. So let us consider the rise of digital platforms and how the computer revolution had brought to us many opportunities. 





I invite you to follow with me and the story of how I came to enjoy working with digital platforms - such as to make computer animations or software - from the early days. But more than just enjoying, and becoming somebody in the world of the digital creations, the opportunity I had was to see how platforms were formed and how platforms exists because they seat on top of others. In other worlds, when I see a digital system, like a mobile phone, I generally see a bit more, I see that whatever "app" is running is running "on top" of a platform, like the Android, and I also see that Android sits on top of what a software engineer would call an systems architecture that depends on many systems and projects of others, and then all of that "seats on top" of a hardware platform too and we could go all the way to the transistors. S

o because all of that can be complicated - if not boring for a business book - I thought of giving us a viewpoint for how I had witnessed the formation of digital platforms, from the age of 10 around 1985 and up to now, so witnessing the first video games, the early personal computers, then the emergence of the Internet browser, then witnessing the early mobile phones and up to now when I have a quite powerful smartphone that receives too many notifications to the point that I had to install "an app" referred as a digital well-being app that allows me to turn off many of the online apps too when I have to do focused work like what I am doing now. 

The origin of seeing things as platforms, or spaces, started to grow from around 1985. These where the days when video games existed already so it was exciting to be growing around these systems. But generally with video games it was sad that we had no way to create those games, or to modify them ourselves. One could only dream and wonder about how these games were made, of course excited about the possibilities of modifying it - What if I could change the clothes of the hero? Of what if I could change the color of the background, or the number of lives, and more. But it didn't take long before my father brought the personal computer. This was a different box because it also had games in it but it had something else which was a more acessible door inviting us to do that kind of custom work. That was the message. You can use the same machine to actually write new things that runs in the machine. And a kid would naturally ask - can all be done from that? And the answer was yes, one could engage and create software systems, and even other video games. 

So the first thing to learn was what the technical folks would call *The Operating System* and too other esential tool referred as *The Programming Language*. With a programming language you can write your own game. So I took that as the truth which made me assume that the computer I had was a thing that enabled the development of games. Since my goal was to build my own game I tried. But it didn't take long for me to start to understand that the programming language that I were using was too simple or limited. So my game seemed to be impossible with the platform I were using. The solution I heard was that I had to write games in a more complex programming language what the technical folks refer as *The Machine Language*. Needless to say that I had no pointers like access to the Internet. The books we had were magazines and I likely didn't express to my parents my intents to dive into that level of detail. So, I had decided to pivot since I were anxious for results and tried to do something more simple. Also time were moving and I would be by now using a better computer. Since I liked to draw I tried to make a software for drawing what the technical folks would refer as a graphics editor. Although that seemed simpler comparing with video games, and I went quite further, I caught myself again limited by the tools I were using or limited by the complex thinking involved to make that work with the limited resources too. Since I couldn't really make that graphics software how I wanted I endup feeling like being somebody usefaul writing software solutions for the world of adults, what technical folks refer as commercial systems. Those were simple, I felt as somebody useful and could even help some adults too. It was exciting and this is how I came to understand that systems for people, or what technical folks would refer as users, were written using programming languages, the things that developers could write games, or graphic editors, or word processors and commercial applications. 

So right there I were experiencing a number of potential platforms. One was the computer itself. And "on top of that" as the technical one would say we had the operating system. And on top of that operating system I had installed the development tools with the programming language and other tools to allow me to write and store my own creations - my own applications. So it was impossible to not see these tools as platforms for creation. And too it was becoming clear that I had to do things and to respect the limits of these platforms or the tools offered. Fast-forward 14 years, I caught myself in a Computer Science course, and a lot in the labs making digital animations and short forms of video commercials for small local companies, and later I caught myself using the Web in front of yet another platform now entitled *The Browser*. This was around 1994, when I became a user and a developer interested in the Netscape Communicator. The interesting thing about that tool and platform was that again it was the thing to use as a normal user and also the thing that could allow you to engage as a creator. So one could focus in visiting web pages and sites, but also to be making them. So now, another "layer" was added to that stack of platforms: First, the computer, then the operating system, then this special application for navigating the Internet where I could too create web pages. All of these with the rules and limits, one seating on top of the other. 

Now, and since I witnessed the rise of the browsers and the internet, one way to see what the internet browser meant, as a platform, is to consider some roles that didn't exist, like the role known as *Web Developer*, which not only didn't exist before the early 1990s but also had significantly evolved [^footnote_marcio_web_developer] along wiht the evolution of the browsers.  


This might be a good moment to jump out from these digital platforms to just bring our minds to do a check that these spaces are everywhere and a lot of what we do are things we do because we imagine us working and living and having a good time or what on top of a platform in a way or another, and too that a lot that what we do we do sometimes quite comfortably because there are far too many platforms that the world had brought to us. In other words, if a kid is trying to understand how web pages are made using an Internet Browser, she might be doing so because she has this system installed in her operating system which was installed in a computer - it does not matter mobile or laptop or a desktop - which is connected to the Internet and also runs because it depends on its underlying elements that depends on electricity and so it is likely that she is in her room and focusing because she is safe and protected so that she can pay attention to that new space or domain or a world, you name it. Maslow, in Maslow on Management had celebrated how the world is interconnected so that better reflection follows:

to be designed from the usage of browser, which helps us to consider the bunble/unblundle notions of Jim Barksdale and Marc Andreessen; and the rise of this and other professional positions, or identities, which didn't exist before the early 90s. But in the beginning of the 90s, web developers were just a few of them. They started as webmasters when sites came out. They were the people that would take care of websites, and they had to be concerned with the user, the visitor, to care about the visitors. They had to be valuing layout and aspects of accessibility, since the web pages were actually a medium for accessing information. They had to be concerned with communication as well, because most web pages were text and graphics, and they weren't really full software programmers. On the aspect of the tool, on the other hand, it's valid to consider that the internet browser, such as the Netscape Navigator, became a bundled toolbox, made of the unbundling of prior technologies and tools, enabling that new kind of, I wouldn't say software engineer. Today, for far too many cities in the world, there are web developers everywhere and even many variations such as front-end engineers, back-end engineers, web designers, user experience designers, and a lot more. Thus, it is unescapable that they made themselves and the ties with the economic model. 

[^footnote_marcio_web_developer]: The web developer, formed after the Internet browser enabled organizations to make sites and software systems available through web browsers. The web developer would then become a worker for the medium of the Web. https://hackernoon.com/the-history-of-web-developers-tied-to-browser-development

But to summarize and go back to the platform inside the platform, these web developers happened to work and play on their space that depends on an internet browser, such as Netscape Navigator in the beginnings, the bundled innovative product create by Netscape Communications. That product, in turn, would run on top of an operating system, any user had recognized that especially in the days that the browser was not bundled in the operating system and was installed apart. But if we keep on zooming out to look at the browser product and the operating syste product, we would then recognize that the browser product were written by others roles. I was there at Netscape and had the opportunity to witness the many engineers working in the browser product to make that a reality. These were creative and experienced software developers able to create complex software that would run, as we say, "on top" of an operating system like Windows or Linux. And if you continue to zoom out, we could consider that the operating system, like Windows, would be then a sorf of platform that also runs "on top" of another platform archicture, like the computer. And although a lot of elements makes a computer, just like a car has a lot beyond its engine, we may simplify for now to think that the computer's underlying element is the CPU, which can generally be know as the computer processor. And if we lock in our zoom to the level of the processor but we shift the angle, back to the businesses bundling these solutions, we will innevitable have to celebrate the iconic Silicon Valley company, Intel, that brought to these machines the Intel processors. 

And if we continue to do this and zoom out, on zoom in depending on how you frame the situation, it is unescapable, especially if we ask what these computer chips where made of, to find the essential element of microprocessors, the transistors. And so and if we lock at the transistor level and shift ourselves to from historical perspective and rewind a few chapters in the history of Silicon Valley, we would find an opportunity to witness when Shockley Semiconductor were founded by the co-inventor of the transistor in the beautiful Santa Clara Valley, a region know at the time for an agriculture producing orchards, apricots, prunes, cherries, plums, and more. I have asked an AI tool to check history by asking "Was Shockley that went to the bay area to live with his mother?" to which the tool replied: 

> *"Yes, William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor and Nobel Prize laureate, moved to the Bay Area, specifically Mountain View, California, in 1956 to be closer to his ailing mother. This move was significant because it led to the establishment of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, the first semiconductor company in the place that would be later known as Silicon Valley. Shockley's decision to relocate there and start his semiconductor company played a crucial role in the development of Silicon Valley as a major hub for high-tech innovation and development."* ChatGPT, 2024. 

Looking from the development of the organizations from the Shockley days to Intel days, we will see a lot of bundle/unbundle effects happening throghout Silicon Valley at many levels, not only from the technological. Digging history to consider how Intel came into existance, we will find that its founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, had priourly founded the then well-known Fairchild Semiconductor that according to *Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley* Intel was one among the other 126 spin-off companies also known as Fairchildren.

--> 

From a managerial perspective, if we rewind to examine the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor, we find that the same individuals who founded Intel, Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, were also known as part of "the Traitorous Eight." [^footnote_trairorous_eight] The history behind the Traitorous Eight, is an invitation for us to consider how the phenomenon of unbundling is entangled with technology, management, and culture: 

[^footnote_trairorous_eight]: The "Traitorous Eight" refers to the eight engineers and scientists who left Shockley Semiconductor due to dissatisfaction with management. They were Gordon Moore, C. Sheldon Roberts, Eugene Kleiner, Robert Noyce, Victor Grinich, Julius Blank, Jean Hoerni and Jay Last; and founded Fairchild Semiconductor; which opens our minds to consider how the idea of leaving a company, and with it its management practices and culture, were connected to the needs of a market in development. 

William Shockley - the manager - was brilliant but not seen as a good manager from the views of his colleagues, especially for eight of them that left Shockley and founded Fairchild Semiconductor. Keep in mind that in 1957 the idea of an employee leaving a company were considered as wrong - very wrong. According to Wikipedia (2024), "Shockley described their leaving as a 'betrayal'." From the perspective of these eight, on the other hand, these were a shift in the managerial practices that were needed and were preventing a major opportunity. 

Now, if we look from the perspective that Shockley had produced Fairchild, and that Fairchild had produced 126 other companies, then it is unescapable to reflect if that event, the Traitorous Eight, had an impact in influencing the views such as views of leaving things behind, inclinations to be open to new management and cultural aspects as part of a potential industry, and the like. In other words, when Shockley have accused them of being "traitors," he may have accelerated the process. Now, and furthermore, let us speculate what would be the mindset of the people working for Fairchild Semiconductor, after these events and their more flexible views that it would be okay to be leaving a company, such as in circumstances of bad management. In other words, a cultural perspective at Fairchild would likely produce employees that would not fear at all to create their own companies. Perhaps some of the referred 126 spin-off Fairchildren [^footnote_fairchild] companies were made by founders that didn't fear leaving Fairchild Semiconductor. 

[^footnote_fairchild]: According to Fairchild, Fairchildren, and the Family Tree of Silicon Valley Fairchild Genealogy (2016, December 20), a published print known as Fairchild Genealogy chart from 1986 included 126 semiconductor companies that were traced directly to Fairchild.

And if we keep forwarding the Silicon Valley movie all the way to Intel days yet focusing on the managerial perspective, we must then celebrate the writings of Andy Grove, Intel's first hire that later became CEO, such as his reflections that led to the writing of High Output Management. While High Output Management has produced direct impact to a lot of other managers that had improved the management of so many Silicon Valley companies and companies around the world, it is also telling us of the managerial transformation and how quick these new managers had to do something such as to create the kind of environment where people would want to work - and to be wanting to say - in an environment where they would not only be fine to move around companies but where so many opportunities would be knocking on their doors.

Then the complication really comes from the potential and the network. Doing something on the bundled platform, platforming adding to it. Or reconsidering the platform, reinventing. The complication is that the platform becomes your terrain, where all happens, like a playground. But something like the Web, such a playground. Or consider the popular platforms for producing "apps" for mobile devices, Google Play or the Apple Store. Developers become the builders on top of those, a community around the methods for building, discussions on top of, on top of the opportunities. The world wants a forward-movement and when there is potential and growth, there is stickyness for the forwardness, to comply with. A whole industry. This may push us to celebrate that platforms and networks are formed and that we may be in fact looking at inside of them, sometimes trapped. And once trapped, when new ideas are coming, it too may sound absurd, like from the point of view of the people that wrote in the newspaper of a school adn were scared about the emergence of locomotives according to Maury Klein: 

> *""* Maury Klein, Power Makers 

But then, again, when the new platform comes our way, then we are well used to all of that, victim of all of that too, conforming with the rules again. But once a network becomes an ecosystem, then it boosts people to run interactions that are supportive of an economy, doesn't it? Consider any network, such as Craigslist, or even Facebook. 

Conclude with the bundle and unbundling challenge?

But when I give more fire to that feeling of discomfort, that something is wrong, it takes me right into that situation of the possibility of enpriosionment where people - I will call them now users - can be in a way trapped within a certain platform; or enprisioned by the interactions of that situation in a given platform likely being experienced by a group. Before we get back to the digital world, let us stay with a simple situation of one in a traffic jam right now somewhere in the world. It certainly brings me to celebrate the existance of the car's air conditioner if the location is hot. And the car music player and the need for comfortable seats. These are things that makes the experience of being stuck to be much better. Celebrating a nice car - and its whistles and bells - stuck in the traffic should also set us to celebrate the cup holder, which would well accomodate a milkshake. And if the driver is a business manager he will may be interested to recall the reflections from Clayton Christensen, the renowned Harvard Business School professor also known for the book *The Innovator's Dilemma*, that had developed the beginnings of the idea that we essentially hire products to do a job for us, that we are essentially seeking for solutions to help our ways to get a job done. Consider the narrative given by professor Clayton and his colleagues, where a researcher interviews commuters and understands better the intents of some commuters for when they bring milkshake to their cars: 

> *The researcher inquired further: “Tell me about a time when you were in the same situation but you didn’t buy a milk shake. What did you buy instead?” Sometimes, he learned, they bought a bagel. But bagels were too dry. Bagels with cream cheese or jam resulted in sticky fingers and gooey steering wheels. Sometimes these commuters bought a banana, but it didn’t last long enough to solve the boring-commute problem. Doughnuts didn’t carry people past the 10 am hunger attack. The milk shake, it turned out, did the job better than any of these competitors. It took people 20 minutes to suck the viscous milk shake through the thin straw, addressing the boring-commute problem. They could consume it cleanly with one hand. By 10:00, they felt less hungry than when they tried the alternatives. It didn’t matter much that it wasn’t a healthy food, because becoming healthy wasn’t essential to the job they were hiring the milk shake to do.*" (Christensen, Cook, & Hall, 2005)

So indeed there are things we do hire to get a job done, and it makes a lot of sense; and I recommend quite well for all entrepreneurs to dig into the Job To Be Done theory, especially the work of Jobs to Be Done Tony Ulwick [^footnote_jtbd_tony] and his colleagues; but too it comes with that that there are levels, or zoom levels for the situation of our lives. You can indeed improve the car for the situations of a jam or boring or long rides, the car folks are doing a good job there. 

But too it comes the undeniable thinking that sometimes crosses our minds - do I need the car? What happens, when we do that, is not that we are essentially giving up the Jobs To be Done theory but in fact we might be fully embracing and recognizing that there are levels that you can focus to consider/reconsider what happens in a space.

[^footnote_jtbd_tony]: JTBD (Jobs to be Done) theory, as developed by Tony Ulwick and Strategyn, presents a groundbreaking framework for innovation. Central to the framework is the notion that customers "hire" products or services to accomplish specific jobs or tasks in their lives. By understanding these jobs in detail, companies can innovate by creating offerings that precisely meet the needs of their customers. Ulwick's approach involves the understanding of the job steps and opportunities associated with a job, providing businesses with a structured process to identify and and come up with ideas to solve unmet needs or met needs in creative ways.

* @outline - a2 - Marcio's reflection about being an Uber Driver  
--> 



We if look at the situation with Uber' story, I was a driver for 1000 trips. Perhaps as I was a part-time driver, not being 100% inside at it, I could bend its reality, a little and in my own way, very softly. I started doing on Fridays, and first my goal was to understand the rules "of the game" how the network works, thus I could exercise the idea of being somebody there, as a driver. I had to fight my fears, to put my mother's car in the streets, and my own fears such as driving into difficult streets, not being a good driver, and a lot more. When I came back that first day, I vividly remember, I sat on the couch but on it's arm with my feet on the couch, happy, telling my parents. Later happy for being a 5-star driver, or 4.9 one. Thus a lot of elements where in there, creating a platform for myself, to be someone, to make money too, where I could use some skills, could go towards been better as a driver, as a person, and get grades, and model my profile. End up with 1000 trips, good memories, and great stories too. 

One of the them was when I took a pregnant woman - she said it was close, last that was false alarm, when she was with her sister. This time, again, she was alone. I asked her - should I pass the red lights? She said no, please don't. Later I told her that we were next to the hospital X, Beneficiência Portuguesa, and she got scared and screamed "No, wrong hospital" to which I figured I confused the name and told here we were are going to the correct destination, and then she arrived safely. 

So I was there, also helping people, therefore not likely in a condition of urgency that would set me to perform in certain metrics, such as performance for money, which gave me experiences, to first see things that could be improved on top of the platform. That reflection was likely related to checking the limits of the bundled reality, like semi-unbundling, the sort of activities that users do, such as lead users [^footnote_lead_users] for when they are in it not trying to unbundle all but intended to support what is bundled, to evolve it. That sort of exposue can take some users to be considered as special, since they co-create the future of platforms, or can even give people jobs too. 

[^footnote_lead_users]: 

The situation I reflected was of the problems of the first trip, which involved the recognition of the fears that I went through, so I have envisioned that Uber could do a lot better to help one driver to reduce its fears. After the feelings of fears, the struggles, I caught myself later receiving an idea from a friend that became a driver. Since he knew that I was an entrepreneur, he called me asking me to make a simulation app for a first Uber trip — one that could create a fictitious trip in the streets. As I reflected about the aspects that apps could teach us in simulated environment [^footnote_uber_first_trip], it was interesting to the recognition of the problem by Ed Baker, a former Head of Product and VP of Growth at Uber: 

[^footnote_uber_first_trip]: https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc 

> *“For me, it was eye-opening when I did my first trip as a driver. I walked out to my car, I have done everything, I was activated. I walked out to my car [and] I walked back to my house because I got so nervous about doing that first trip.”*

Another sort of opportunity I crossed, although it seemed a bit outside the boundaries of Uber, was what I have named "Uber-idle university" [^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university] which explored an opportunity for learning as I have replaced the arbitrary with talks, Youtube lectures saved as mp3. To make the experience good, I also had to workout certain roadblocks, such as to curate a list of 3-5 talks before the day trips, and to come up with a saying for the passengers, giving them the option to talk with me or let me study what I called "Entrepreneurship lessons in English". Most passengers supported and even encouraged me. 

[^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university]: Marcio S Galli's article "Uber-idle University," published in Ascent Publication on December 2, 2017, delves into the concept of turning idle time into educational opportunities, particularly while performing tasks that don't require full cognitive engagement, such as driving for Uber. Galli, an entrepreneur who drives part-time for Uber, argues that much of the time spent in the car can be repurposed for learning by listening to talks, podcasts, or lectures on a pen drive. He distinguishes between "distractions" and "pauses," suggesting that Uber-related interruptions merely pause his educational experience rather than derail it. The article also highlights how the nature of listening fosters deeper engagement with the content, facilitating opportunities for reflection and understanding. Galli concludes by noting that this practice has led him to be more involved in helping startups, including his own. This article reflects a broader interest in finding innovative ways to incorporate learning into daily routines, a concept that has been especially relevant in the gig economy where traditional work hours are often disrupted. https://medium.com/the-ascent/uber-idle-university-5af317b550d9

### The bundled forces 





Now, as we go back to the space for innovation, it seems that the celebration of the platform, when a network in a state of virtuous growth, which seems to go along with aspects indivated in the approach for scaling of Blitzscaling. From the standpoint of growth, and the view from inverstors interested in scaling platform networks, the analysis is for what elements neeed to be in the place, what forces are fovaourable or against, considering the expectations and vision of the network reaching its full potential. In the story of Uber, a prior network was know as the "yellow cabs" situation. Sequoia partners doing analysis, wanted to invest but to recognize the risks and take a strategy of focusing first in black cars. Sequoia has identified players that were in the field of unbundling the cabs networks, and one of them had the opportunity, although Sequoia wanted them to go back to black, stay away from yellow cabs at that moment. The CEO didn't accept. Later Sequoia end up finding an entrepreneur from San Francisco that were focusing in the black cards and asked if he would be okay with the moving on top of yellow cabs in the right time. And that became Uber. 

Another story, that shows how risks are taken in consideration when the matter are networks, is shown in the story of Linkedin [^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen] where the founders have documented aspects of the struggle to understand when and how to monetize the network. They indicate that some other social networks here real competitors but some of them wanted to make revenue ahead of time, while LinkedIn had a strategy to cover at least USA as a metric for its success with its main customer, corporations looking to hire people. 

[^footnote_bliztscaling_linkedin_blue_allen]: 

These situations show intended efforts that seeks a readiness level for the network to be bundled. This is like showing that the curation of the platform, analysis for its future potential, is a must. VC partners of great VC organizations, such as Sequoia, Greylock and A16Z, are examples that show an intended analysis of how networks operate and the risks of scaling. In a way, the body of knowledge from these groups are able to bend reality, from a view from outside. 

But now, back to individuals anr the struggles of entrepreneurs, all of that tell us that stability in the platform produces ooportunities. Or a great platform with network potential involves offering opportunities in a stable matter, the ground for an economic model or interaction that produces value. Which comes after that the aspects which I refered as the prison. 

A complication is that we can be somebody in many of these platform systems, but the experience of being somebody, especially when we are driven by certain metrics, such as performance in attributes such as score, or grades, or money, can also prevent us from seeing opportunities, expect the condition of the exercise of the attempt to maximize effienncy in the network boils back to the situation of feedback that enriches the network. But the point I want to focus now is when being busy can also come with estability of the individual in the network. 

An additional complication is when we are trapped ny many layers. Like consider a phase of a computer game, a game that is more like an experience available in a world that supports games, a network platform for games, and that the game was written on top of an operating system that runs on top of a computer system. 

If the producer of the game experience decides to shut down its servers, impact is first perceived by the network of users experiencing that experience. For them, out of the sudden, the network seems to be down, but they might figure later that the developer-owner gave up. For some, sadness might take place as part of who they are were being exercised in the game environment, through an user profile. 

But when just playing the game, before the incident, it would indeed be quite difficult for one to bend the reality expect if by any chance you had another agenda that could give you the means to see reality from different viewpoint. We should note that while estabily in the platform exists, which pushes me to keep referring it as a prison, the opportunity for freedom is exercised by the users themselves, as each one might live an agenda and their needs can also take them to become creative, from sending suggestions to more deeper reflective experiences. Author Eric von Hippel, in Democratizing Innovation [^foonote_eric_von_hippel_democratizing_innovation], offers a great perspective about how users might become co-creators with producers. 

[^foonote_eric_von_hippel_democratizing_innovation]: 

Now, there are then the improvements within the realm, the hackers, and the ones that might reconsider the whole experience. Thus, we can assert about layers within the platform, and as humans as humans, they could be exposed to deeper reflections about the realities of all these layers that they be me acting in, or even the actual reflections for the ultimate layers which we decided to anchor ourselves in - such as the case of Albert Einstein.

In the realm of innovative products or services, for example, the notion of category design, as indicated by Play Bigger author Christopher Lochhead [^footnote_play_bigger], exposes elements involved for then new categories of products and services are evident.

#### Who owns the truth 





Now, in the heated/cold space of one that lives the experience, it comes the considerations of experiencing that put us to reflect, go seek for truths, challenge the boundaries. When I had reflected about that my first trip as an Uber driver, I took me into writing an article because I considered that the platform could do something about something I saw, a need. Since I had an agenda for reusing the car radio to support my goal of watching talks, I had the opportunity to visualize that Uber-idle University idea. 

Some of these extended experiences can be suggested by platforms too. Consider a Yoga program that guides its participants into the levels of reflections, adding value to the experience. Another example, which I learned from my partner, was a situation of a dance program referred as bio dance, where she has acknowledged that she has reached a level of reflective state about her experience, brought up meaning, as in philosophical reflections which were relevant to others as their dance experience involved a guided experienced with well designed exercises to put the participants in the right spot to reflect. Another example might happen in the situation of reading Harry Potter, as indicated by Kasper ter Kuile the author of The Power of Rituals. Kasper has indicated that the experience from reading Harry Potter has components that brings up a connection with the self, with truths, and life situations, such as to a point of people organize themselves to reflect and discuss about what they experience as they read. The point here to make is that certain experiences might more or less push us towards the reflective interactions about our direct needs vs. internal needs and reflectinve interactions might enable us to explore the limits of the experience too. 

Robert McKee talks about truth and the necessity, for a storyteller, to bring out truth through stories. This same idea might be applicable to entrepreneurship because there is that idea that good ideas and solutions are liberating, that unbundle reality as we know it, and bundles a new reality.

To illustrate the situation, consider the case of a school, referred by Maury Klein in Power Makers, that wrote a post indicating that if God wanted locomotives he would have made humans with locomotive faces. Which shows that whoever wanted to be against locomotives had their own believes about an underlying truth. Conversely, the promoters of locomotives had their own reasons, and values, to promote that as the future. 

Another, anedoctal situation, more of the life in the kitchen, would be the situation that Marcio has identified of the advertisements of one popular convection oven. They would promote as able to fry things with no oil, which seemed great. But also another truth in it is that it would be the best when "frying" oily things



Now, these considerations for entrepreneurs for minimally consider the reflections on living their identities as somebody, on a platform, for leaving too, for reflecting outside. These exercises of writing, enable us to break the flow, sort of to get out from the autopilot was of flowing, acting. Julia Cameron uses methods of writing, with her prompts through articles, as a means for guiding potential writers outside the zone of writers block.
