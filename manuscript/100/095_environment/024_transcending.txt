## Transcending spaces








Assuming that we are now acquainted with the influence of our rich environment, if not by the motion that it had given on us then by the considerations we went through so far, we shall ask ourselves about the experience of seeing beyond the box. The reason for so is because our movement starts from within the box. in an environment that incessantly teases us to build, and where the means for building don't really care if we use them in meaningful ways or they were used as distractions. We shall note that the means for building, solutions given to build, are friendly with us, so when we fail they are likely to promote themselves as conductors for lessons learned. For that, let us focus on the moment before the action of getting things done takes place, to recognize the movement that happens to ignite ourselves to jump, and to build, that bridge without, generally, noticing all the nuances about what we are doing. If one had the time to notice, they could live the feeling of discomfort about their situation, perhaps not even move further. For other, an optimistic or a romantic aspiring a better future, they might simply reach a sort of epiphany, or they get involved for the sake of growing themselves, as somebody, and perhaps others reasons. But it is undeniable that the it is after the movement that they engage in the aspects of figuring, as in to reconsider, if they should continue to build that bridge - the why - to figure the ways to conduct the elements from the source - the how - in ways that produce a solution that is coherent to the destination of people - the what.

Now, if they hire themselves - if they choose to accept this mission - they will enter a holistic journey consisting of many job steps - to organize, plan, check the go-no-go, execute, and monitor how they do it - which sets them to live an experiential learning while living the hopes that their bridge can sustain itself by the movement it provokes to the environment. This necessity for sustainability is independent of their outcomes, thus it won't matter if they produce softer changes at the surface or harder ones that disrupts the core. As an example of the softer, back to the car thought initially as a means for transportation, the situation that a car can be stuck in traffic or if the location is hot or if the ride is long or the weather is cold can certainly prompt them improve the experience of drivers, to launch solutions like the air conditioner, a music player, heated seats, and more. Or they too be more oriented to the rearrangements of the means to the end, such as reinventing the methods and how to use of resources to build cars and any solutions in it such as to reduce the costs of production. As for going deeper an innovative solution to the target space may consist of removing the necessity of humans driving, with autonomous driving; and in terms of the source space could be about a new kind of engine. Now, as a consequence of the disruptive situation, the outcomes produced may actually bridge again these spaces; as an example a new engine that is advanced and (in the long run) simpler to produce may also change the experience of the drivers, like avoiding them to have to fuel their cars. 

Now one thing the world of innovation knows - that whatever it is it won't survive if the customers are not interested in using it and able to use it. While that does not give all the answrers to how to do it, it a good interesting problem to celebrate; and also a reason for us to celebrate some insights from the researchers and practitioners concerned with the challenges of innovation. A major challenge recognized by these minds has to do with the problem of listening to the people. The listening is vital, as people living experiences carries the answers, but as entrepreneurs had matured the challenge may involve not strictly listening to them as they are essentially to a certain extent like entrepreneurs living in the box and then to entangled with the existing solutions for doing things, to involved to transcend from their ways of doing, which explains that famous concern - which may or may not have said by Henri Ford - but that was formed to addres the complication that if these producers had asked to people they would have told that they wanted a faster horse [^footnote_henryford_fasterhorse]. 

[^footnote_henryford_fasterhorse]:

That faster horse is not a bad thing to want, so it may be that "these people," if they existed, were right. On another hand, assuming that producers could not produce faster horses, the challenges for addressing what to do would depend on knowing what people were trying to do with a faster horse, or to figure what people were doing it, to listen to their routines, their needs, their expectations as they were involved in their daily jobs. This is where an insightful perspective from Professor Clayton Christensen - the renowned professor from Harvard Business School and author of the book, *The Innovator's Dilemma* - came to help entrepreneurs and led practitioners to further develop structured models to help entrepreneurs to innovate forward by looking at the environment of their customers. This work is known as Jobs to Be Done which is essentially about not asking customers what they want, as solutions, and shifting the focus to understand the needs of the customers by looking what they are trying to get done. The famous illustration, given by a narrative created by professor Clayton and his colleagues, can be recounted before our further discussions: 

> *The researcher inquired further: “Tell me about a time when you were in the same situation but you didn’t buy a milk shake. What did you buy instead?” Sometimes, he learned, they bought a bagel. But bagels were too dry. Bagels with cream cheese or jam resulted in sticky fingers and gooey steering wheels. Sometimes these commuters bought a banana, but it didn’t last long enough to solve the boring-commute problem. Doughnuts didn’t carry people past the 10 am hunger attack. The milk shake, it turned out, did the job better than any of these competitors. It took people 20 minutes to suck the viscous milk shake through the thin straw, addressing the boring-commute problem. They could consume it cleanly with one hand. By 10:00, they felt less hungry than when they tried the alternatives. It didn’t matter much that it wasn’t a healthy food, because becoming healthy wasn’t essential to the job they were hiring the milk shake to do.*" (Christensen, Cook, & Hall, 2005)

One key takeaway from the milkshake business case may be the implication that the milkshake can help a different people in the same situaton - people living the need for drinking/eating while driving, thus not a specific demographic. Now if we focus in the Jobs to Be Done further, we also observe that they do their things, that they get their things done, thus that they carry answers as they carry needs; and that they are quite involved in their attempts to improve their situation, thus willing to pick solutions, or to hire solutions as the system says. As a consequence, yet another takeway, is that the listening to the collection of insights about the needs of groups with same needs may well represent the exercise of transcendence that enables entrepreneurs to come up with solutions. 

On the other hand, it is yet challenging because if we dig too far things may reach out to concerns that also transcends from beyond the things people do, as in their aspirations. As in, if we dig too much, we may go all the way to things like to live longer, to be happier, to give people means to learn better, and more. Thus, the complication for the ones interested in getting things done has too to do with finding a stable place where they are engaged as somebody into the why to do it, how to do it, and what to do it. This challenging movement can be emphasized by the words of Michael Dearing given an an interview with Reid Hoffman:

Those are about as different sets of pursuits with very little in common with each other.

If you find yourself totally in love with the technical insight manufacturing process, that is a real problem. And then you end up having science projects, not companies.

The message from Michael and the further considerations are reminders about the importance of us to be in a sweet spot - a place that is meaningful for ourselves and that serves well to the both spaces, the sourcing space and the target space of users. Yet, another reason for us to be calmer and to be reflective as we are searching, or refining, or exploring the what to do. 

Moving forward in this direction, let us consider an annecdote about how any space can connect with far too many jobs that are being dones by people,  and then to settle ourselves to recognize the challengs for stability as we position between the sourcing world and the target space of users.

### 1000 trips in a box 







I used to joke among friends - when we happened to be drinking and thinking that we had an insightful idea - that the best ideas would come from the shittiest places; usually followed by some of us noticing that the saddest part would be that we wouldn't remember anything the next day. This is yet another supporting point as for why the rise drinking coffee[^footnote_blitzscaling_ted_coffee] helped us to become better builder of things. 

[^footnote_blitzscaling_ted_coffee]: During the Blitzscaling lecture 3 by Michael Dearing, *Blitzscaling 03: Michael Dearing on Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction* (Greylock, 2015), a student chimed in, reminding us that the rise of coffee shops throughout Europe as spaces for exchanging ideas was parallel to the growth curve of the industrial revolution. An elaboration on this observation is found in Steven Johnson's TED talk, "Where good ideas come from" (TED, 2010), where he expands about enlightened developments through Europe that went along with a society of coffee drinkers as opposed to a society of drunken people.

But if any truth exists there is a hint that it takes quite a trip to see through, to break the walls of our spaces. Thus, I invite you through a moment when I did about 1,000 trips as an "Uber driver," and a reflection about the conditions must exist for ideas to rise from the places and situations that people live. In other words, that first-hand experience is not enough, for example if one is too busy living the experiences first-hand and not able to transcend aiming for a different situattion, which can be the case when we are in a hurry which wasn't my case we will see. 

In other words, I wasn't a normal driver. In fact, no drivers should be considered as "normal drivers." That attempt - to see people in buckets such as to call them "motorista de aplicativos" as they call in Brazil - may well be one of the reasons that makes things difficult for us to see through. I would say that I wasn't following the playbook because I wasn't full time. I were doing on Fridays and I wanted to rethink my life, to understand how things worked, to make some money, to live the experience, and to be somebody. But make no mistake I saw myself as a real Uber driver whih took me to keep up and reach out to the 1,000 rides throughout 2017. Thus, as driver, I were happy to help people, being more calm in the the traffic, and connecting with people such as that day that I did an extra effort to help a lady to setup her wheelchair, or the other day which I took a pregnant woman - who was close to her due date - to the hospital. As a driver I was proud and wanted to see if I could be a 5-star driver. 

But as for the a-ha moments I had noted that it comes from everywhere - from the drivers and their experiences - while it onl rises to the surface if some extra conditions are met that set us to be open to possibility. A particular experience leading to an idea was connected with the experience of the first trip - a trip I won't forget because I felt in a calling - to fight my fears - to face the fears of driving into difficult streets, to face my fears of not being a good driver, my fears of allowing strangers in the car, and a more. One thing I recall vividly was how I felt in the end of the first day, surprised that I was alive and happy that I was happy and how excited I were to tell my parents. While I felt the fears of that first trip and the feelings of having done it nothing really came out in terms of ideas, like solutions. But it was later that the dots connected when I caught myself listening to an idea from a friend which I had encouraged to become a driver. It could be that he knew that I was an entrepreneur that took him to call me and ask if I could come up with a "simulation app" to help a new driver with their first trip. He wanted an experience where he could turn on his smartphone and where the screen would look like a real trip, where he had to pick up an imaginary passenger from a location and take her to another. I didn't do anything but the conversation became a reflection that became an article [^footnote_uber_first_trip] which went along, as I found later, with recognitions about the challenges of the first trip as told by Ed Baker, a former "Head of Product" from Uber:  

[^footnote_uber_first_trip]: Drawing from my initial Uber driving experiences, I had the opportunity to write an article and to reflect about the challenges of that first trip situation that could happen to many other drivers. Read more in Why that first Uber (driver) trip never happened. Ascent Publication. https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc

> *“For me, it was eye-opening when I did my first trip as a driver. I walked out to my car, I have done everything, I was activated. I walked out to my car [and] I walked back to my house because I got so nervous about doing that first trip.”*
> Ed Baker (Greylock Partnets, 2017, 14m9s)

So right here we might pause for a moment to consider that the problem of transcending, while it connects with what people feel when they are living the experiences first-hand, it only happens if the conditions for possibility of change are seen. Thus, this is yet a situation to support that situations of growth, or rush, or too busy, may well set us to not access these naturally unless action is taken. 

Another opportunity I came accross went beyond the boundaries of the setting given by Uber and I took further action. This one was "Uber-idle university" [^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university] and and consisted of a solution for learning while driving. Since at the time I needed to study entrepreneurship lectures, then I had the idea of replacing the normal car music with lectures. Because my phone wasn't good enough at the time to run the Uber app and audio, the solution I found was to save the lectures from Youtube as audio and download to a portable flashdrive and then to plug in the car radio. All were great for a while but not entirely working because of a few roadblocks. To make the experience better, I figured that I had to spend time to curate a list of good talks before taking the road, thus reducing the risks of too many bad lectures in a row which could make me lose the entire day. Another challenge had to do with the passengers - if they would accept - which I solved by telling them in advance that those were my "Entrepreneurship lessons in English," and that I was good to turn off. Not to my surprise, the support was great and so I was able to watch more than one hundred talks on entrepreneurship and to recognize that the moment of being an app driver was much less distracting than the being in front of the computer.    

[^footnote_marcio_uber_idle_university]: The article entitled "Uber-idle University," explores how I end up exploring the time inside the car with educational content and shows  an example of the playlists I were using. Read more in https://medium.com/the-ascent/uber-idle-university-5af317b550d9


With that, we can celebrate that solutions are linked to the experiences and feelings and the needs of users which can be observed from various levels of abstraction. From those one-thousand trips, I had the chance to see basic improvements to Uber the application, like problems with their system, but also explored the experience of the conditions, such as of the new drivers living that first trip problem. And as we had seen, the other experiences that transcended the scope given initially. A reflection about this situation may also be an opportunity to recognize that beyond the conditions to access the needs of people, the initial movement to come up with a potential solution depends on something from other more significant insight which reduces the variability of what can be done - or in other words a great idea leading to a solution is one that needs to be coherently understood by the audience.

### Approaching the target space 






Now the observation that we are incessantly doing it - unbundling our spaces and bundling or escaping the conditions from our ways of living and - but always joining people on the other end, is a clue that besides the favorable conditions for the movement the movement also happens by the *Given* that we are connected with others, in good or bad ways, directly or indirectly, in a world where all spaces are connected with others or given by others and by the knowing that all these spaces are changing too, perhaps transcending. As an example, I would think that was able to hack a solution for a better use my "idle moment" inside a car because I have considered that in the car I would be less subject to the distracting conditions given the habits that I had developed by using my smartphones always looking the notifications from networks and systems I had subscribed. 

<!--
@note @insight - Feat. Eugene The World The Slaves Made - There might be a valid thinking that all spaces, even the situation of oppression, may offer space for change from within by the movements of friction and interaction with the better spaces of others, and by the cracks that an oppressor system has to offer, or it may be that the oppressor system is just a box of a bundled situation of a society impacting and opressing others. @ref-id 7676-7564-8474-8384
--> 

Now and given that we will face the crowds, not matter if more or less we put a dent in the universe or bring a better cup of coffee to them, we shall embrace the complication of accessing and assessing the target space by navigating the target space in the first place. One particular problem, as we approach the *Market* if you will, starts right there from our own observation that they are a market. Thus, especially as fast movers, we are set to judge the target space by using the googgles - or the measurement systems - we made to comprehend things in the first place. In other words, although we measure things now using rich scientific systems, we are essentially subject to the scientific movement that came to explain our reality as it is, certainly a reality given by technology [^footnote_peterdrucker_science_measurements_from_technology]. 

[^footnote_peterdrucker_science_measurements_from_technology]: Peter Drucker, in *The Technological Revolution: Notes on the Relationship of Technology, Science, and Culture* and his considerations that technology comes before science - "it is technology that gives the union of the two its character; it is a coupling of science to technology, rather than a coupling of science and technology" (Drucker, P. (2011). p. 152. Routledge. Original work published 1970) - may well support us into the explaining the reality of our lives by the available scientific building blocks, which likely came after technology has changed our lives. Thus, the idea of market is a way to look at people by bucketizing them because of the effects of the technological offerings that shaped ourselves in the world, in a bucket. 

Furthermore and to add complexity to our navigation, our decisions are supported by translating data (as measured) as values, fairly to save ourselves from the trouble of using boring or complex interactions in normal and fast conversations. As an example, during a visit I made to my car's mechanic a couple years ago, I asked him about the potential rise of eletric cars in Brazil. His reasons for why it wouldn't work consisted of market-oriented reasons which sounded professional and realistic to me. 

Thus, it is fair to celebrate that if we are comfortable in expressing people needs as market needs defined by market definitions as we know it, we are not doing much different from that school from Ohio in 1828 when they put God against the locomotives - as God would more generally appear as common values of that bundled reality to secure that bundled reality as it were. In other words, the fact that we add value to navigate our decisions by using values bundled by our environment is real and can be a prime mover for fast movement in some circumstances can take us to good things in other can be a trap.  

This complication, and reason for us to be calmer when approaching our target spaces, can be celebrated together with leading practitioners of the lean movement as they recognized that a prior definition of a market - by measurements of traditional markets - can cost teams a lot, especially when they are using lean methods. In *How to Find a Market? Use Jobs-To-Be-Done as the Front End of Customer Discovery* (2021, November 4), Steve Blank and the Jobs-to-be-Done team (Tony Ulwick and Ted Thayer) had elaborated on the problem where essentially "*Lean Doesn’t Have a Market Definition Step*," a situation leading to a potential trap. To elaborate, let us start with the fact that lean methods ask us to learn from customers: 

> *"The Lean Startup methodology asks innovators to interview potential customers within their “market” to discover the customer’s unmet needs and establish a product/market fit. Given the number of interviews to get meaningful data, this can take months."* (Blank, S., 2021, November 4)

The approach sounds simple - or lean indeed - given the that these methods welcome teams to navigate and learn with real customers and implied good news that existing customers exist from within existing markets. In other words, teams are half-way there to pick customers after the given categorizations of existing markets - like demographic or a vertical or technologies - plus the fact that the market carries the pointers for where they are since people are bucketized by its terms. However, as lean invites them to "deepen their understanding of the customer," they may quickly hit a wall which in the lenses of lean is not at all a wall since lean asks them to pivoting the market or the customer needs or the value proposition. This iteration may take them into a "circular loop can cause them to churn, pivot, and fail." (Blank, S., 2021, November 4)

In other words, entrepreneurs doing lean with methods such as *Business Model Canvas*, *Customer Development*, and *Agile Engineering,* are indeed in good position to quickly check if their hypotheses are correct/incorrect inside a market. But also equally positioned to be drifting or hopping between the orbits of existing markets given that these methods don't help them to "figure out *where to start the search* for a new business." 

But another major problem also happens from the very situation are provoked to consider their entrepreneurial journey after pivoting themselves outside of their area of interests. While many of them will feel good to know that their crazy hypothesis weren't welcomed by customers - saving them from the trouble of building for no reason - a particular circumstance rises too when they find good news, when they find validation of customer's interest but then realizing that they are now invited to innovate in a domain which they have no interest. In other words, the good news is that "we can make money here" but the bad news is that all of our cofounders "don't want to work on that." 


But let us, for now, stick with the Jobs To Be Done which is.. 

> *"Rather than defining markets as existing, adjacent or new markets – or by verticals, technology, demographics, et al. all markets can be described by what job the user wants to get done"* 








<!--
@quote 
> *"These tools tell you how to rapidly find product/market fit inside a market, and how to pivot when your hypotheses are incorrect. However, they don’t help you figure out where to start the search for your new business."* (2021, November 4)

--> 





Another key takeaway of the jobs to be done, strategic and thoughtful and structured thinking of this special team, namely Ted Thayer and Tony Ulwick and their team at Strategyn, is their interest to see the fundamental aspects that brings innovation in the middle of the spaces of people, transcending to a certain extent. For instance, giving us great ideas for how to find stability in terms of the people needs. One key aspect that they bring is the idea of job steps. That's essentially, they had identified a kind of consistent characterizations of the phases that all jobs carries; that all the jobs always follow that same path, the following path:

<!--
@meta @todo 
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Space - Review job steps given by Chatgtp @meta-refid 1222-3332-2323-4445
-- >

* Defining the Job: Recognizing a need or problem.
* Searching for Solutions: Researching and exploring possible solutions.
* Selecting a Solution: Choosing the best-fit solution based on various criteria.
* Executing the Job: Using the selected product or service to accomplish the task.
* Assessing Outcomes: Evaluating the effectiveness of the solution in solving the problem.
* Post-Evaluation Adjustments: Making decisions on continuation, replacement, or adjustment based on the evaluation.

The immediate objective opportunity from that, for innovators, is that their solutions can serve the needs of one or more steps. Although from a romantic perspective an ideal solution would suggest that all the steps of a job are solved - like magic or a miracle - in the ideal world of entrepreneurship that shows a preference for getting things done, innovators seek for a sweet spot, to help the job by positioning an offering solution that may improve one or more steps. If that is enough, it won't matter. It may be that the solution improves the step for a market that is already served with other solutions like providing a non-stick spray in a world of cookers using standard pans, which precisely tackles the step of preparation in the job of cooking; or it may disrupt through steps such as if we consider the introduction of a non-stick pan to that world. 

A example that JTBD team uses for one that covers many steps is the iPod: 

A conclusion for innovators goes back to a strategy for them to be able to be somebody in the process and to come up with something that they can do it and that can sustain. The framework will give them the means to move from that initial better consideration of a market - in terms of the job - and then to see where they can do something given the various needs through the steps.

[^footnote_jtbd_tony]: JTBD (Jobs to be Done) theory, as developed by Tony Ulwick and Strategyn, presents a groundbreaking framework for innovation. Central to the framework is the notion that customers "hire" products or services to accomplish specific jobs or tasks in their lives. By understanding these jobs in detail, companies can innovate by creating offerings that precisely meet the needs of their customers. Ulwick's approach involves the understanding of the job steps and opportunities associated with a job, providing businesses with a structured process to identify and and come up with ideas to solve unmet needs or met needs in creative ways.

### Approaching the source space 








Advancinng to the end of this chapter through this bridge, towards the place which we take things from, we should first recognize the weakeness of the metaphorical structure because of its circularity. In other words, even if a spaceship brings a new form of energy from an asteroid, only a mind in a hurry shall miss the point that the ship was *Made in Earth*. With that said, and to serve our own interests, we shall too celebrate its strenght because what entrepreneurs do is to essentially create a gap between the present and the future and furthermore working to close it, to build. In addition, we shall recognize that these knights are interested in answering the questions from the gatekeepers (for example investors) although sometimes they reframe the question in ways that catapults the investors away from the bridge. 

As we approach, we shall too carry other premisses which we took from that "target space" whereas a calmness took place to let us not see people as demographics, as in people equals to data, where the Jobs To Be Done had set us to see that the flow of people's work matters more. With the same perspective we approach this "source space," with a calmess when we see the means to get things done - like money, resources, tools, methods, networks, investors, and more - as essentially the means to an end. But too, we shall too, be calm to notice that the means to an end requires an extra caution. This may be so because if we see the means to an and as in building blocks for an action in a hurry, we may inadvertently imagine that we can simply appropriate these things for the sake of transforming - like taking apples and apples from a giving tree - and miss the necessity and strategic importance of a movement that depends from a sustainable condition, which depends from that circularity, and suggests that better fruits shall be given if we see the source as a mutually beneficial tree [^footnote_michaeldearing_mutually_tree]. 

[^footnote_michaeldearing_mutually_tree]: The Mutually Beneficial Trading Tree (Harrison, G., & Grosz, F., 2021), likely co-authored by Michael Dearing from Harisson Metal, suggests that the entrepreneurial movement consists of building things by establishing a partnership with the roles that are providers of the resources.

So let us then proceed towards the gates and be greeted by the roles that are generally seen the ones controlling the source for how to get things done, generally investors. Although venture capital investors emerged quite after the industrial revolution, its fundamental values had emerged as a supporting role to the entrepreneurial function. This function that didn't exist before, and got to be comfortable in welcoming the entrepreneurial strangers, giving them superpowers, is likely an evolution of the collaborative potential where humans in the control of the power, like technological power of resources to unleash work, had enlightened themselves to understand that the future consisted in surrendering control and embracing creativity. The function, therefore, is right in the middle as it enables the creative new by the release of the old, what were the fruits of its success, such as money and other resources, had to be released enabling the new to enter the space, likely in a way that they are not vanished and can be part of that future.

An early example of that relationship, from long before venture capital existed, can be observed by the particular dynamics where the Brown family from the U.S. had enlightened themselves and their wealth by partnering with the creative-destructive genius of entrepreneurs and setting themselves as self-cleaning oven [^footnote_michaeldearing_selfcleaning] as opposed to be erased from the timeline of history as Michael Dearing had elaborated in the interview given to Reid Hoffman:  

[^footnote_michaeldearing_selfcleaning]: In (2017, April 25) Michael Dearing had elegantly brought the elements of capitalism that produces new management, new entrepreneurs, and the new world, as the moment when "the creative-destructive genius of entrepreneurs" finds the "the visible hand of general management," and uses the "industrial wealth to improve civilization."

> *"The people who funded Slater's Mill were the Brown family of Providence, the same family after whom Brown University was named. This was a family that made their fortune first in the slave trade and then in the textile business. They had no idea how to mechanize their spinning operations. Slater epitomized someone with the technical skill and inventiveness needed."* (Michael Dearing, Greylock Partners, October 2015, 30:27)

Another component that investors carry on, which exactly comes from their position between the old and the new world, is that They regulate the release of the resources - not only from their own, but of the resources that are passed by the connections that they hold. Thus, they are the function that depends on other functions and show ties with currents given by the economic, social, and cultural layers. And furthermore, this perspective or activity is perceived as the risk analysis which characterizates them which where they essentially recognize the potential, in terms of its disruptive power, its acceptance, and to consider these forces in favor, or against; therefore, essentially are concerned for the pouring of resources in ways that the new can be sustainable in the long run. As an example, if we go back to the case of Bill Gurlley of Benchmark Capital, we shall highlight his concerns and suggested strategy for an investment starting with the black cars, like limo service, instead of facing straight the traditional "yellow cab" industry. Therefore, like this case reveals, investors carry on the role of being strategic thinkers about how anything can be built in a world where it depends on the world to survive.

Now, in alignment with the premise reminded by Michael Dearing that entrepreneurs are the creative-destructive minds, it follows that they are essentially responsible for pitching these investors who are mainly gatekeepers to all the other sources of investment. In other words, their duty deals with finding the message, or the messages, that works across from themselves, to investors, to colleagues, partners, users, institutions, and any other entangled entities. As they are challenged to see through these many connections, they are equally challenged to put order to their quest, which, to reduce the extent and improve certainty we may refer to it as "The message," that mobilizes what it takes to get things done. Now if some confusion arises by the observation that certain things build do not carry "The message," I ask us to consider these as irrelevant little distractions - at least to us as builders of a better future - and to focus on the fact that "The message" exists in all that is built and sticks, thus it does not matter if what exists is incremental or disruptive innovations. Thus although not always clear, this message supports our idea of "I think therefore I am," because my day to day shows that I am also "using a tool" which I make meaning of it "because it carries a message," about who I can come. This message exists in a cup of coffee, in a book, an internet browser, a social network, and in all concrete things being used.

If our job is to find the message that mobilizes our parters in crime, we may well start from the space we came - where people are living their lives and getting their jobs done - as our partners know too that they are the ones to make the final call. If we visit a busy coffee shop, we can get a picture of how a coffee is "hired" to help a reader go through one thousand words in four minutes. Moreover, we know too that a thousand times more powerful than that is word of mouth - essentially the main thing that keeps a coffee shop alive. 

Now, by reflecting on the phenomenon of word of mouth - given by what appears to be intrinsic message carried by object carried by the subject - we shall recognize it as the birthplace of the world of advertising which together with the world of marketing took us to understand in great detail and value how the message carries the power to, in a holistic way, pitch all the parties involved.

From the world of marketing, the work of Donald Miller cracks the code as for how we decide our problems by decisions that essentially happens through the storytelling, and specifically how the classic story structure is the most efficient mechanism we use, given that we essentially compare ourselves with a hero that aspires a happy end whereas a problem prevents that from happening unless an action is taken. The more elaborated version, as indicated from *Building a StoryBrand: Clarifying Your Messages So Customers Will Listen* (2017) follows: 

> *""*

In other words, as our inherent mechanism tells from inside, we are not in any ways beings that jump to the fire of action to test what happens as if we had many lifes. We are beings living in a world where the world is spinning and the clock is ticking and our one life is all we have and where all a lot that we can do when it takes to being strategic consists in reading and writing stories before deciding to put in practice. In other words, we walk the talk. Moreover, the structure from stories, which by the way make us enjoy all sorts of stories from classical romantic to fiction as an example, boils down to the fact that any objective problem we have to solve on our way are in fact just abstract steps that need to be addressed so that we can achieve our higher objetives. From the lenses of Storybrand, from the perspective of stories, this perspective can be explored by the idenfification of the problems of the heroes from the specific problem to the more general:  

> *"When these three levels of problems are solved in one shot, the audience experiences a sense of pleasure and relief, causing them to love the story."* (Miller, D., 2017, p. 69)

Now and going back to our quest to access the message to our other audiences - the parties wen want to mobilize - this exploration about the levels of problems can be supportive exactly because the various levels of problems can help us to see through, to access a holistic message that reveals not only the strenght of a message for users but also let us correlate if that potential aspirational message can be well-received and supported by these partners we seek. 

As an example, if we go back to the case of a ride-hailing solution and imagine a story of a rider that is visiting multiple spots in a busy city area where parking is difficult. Say that her external problem consists of being able to pick a ride from anywhere easily, getting to destinations in an affordable way. By following the method, an internal problem cold be that she feels frustrated about the option of driving a car, such as after renting it, and being anxious to deal with the traffic and parking. As for the philosophical problem, she would likely appreciate a solution that not only addresses her primary concerns but also aligns with her expectations of a city — providing accessible and affordable transportation options that include carpooling capabilities. Now, if a solution is thought to only solve some internal problems, some other parties may not pay much attention. As an example, if a technological solution consists of calling a cab, traditional cab drivers may enjoy. But if, on the other hand, a technological solution explores too the further problems of the car volume and proposes that any car moving should essentially become a ride sharing solution, then now the discussion likely was expanded to many others as it will reach the attention of the traditional taxi drivers, the taxi industry players regulating it, the city development departments, and others.

#### Data, processing and flow 


Having thus considered that anything that exists in the spaces sets a message that ripples through the environment, we shall proceed consider the other challenges are set in place once the message spreads in the environment; as it becomes subject to the very effects it produces given by how the dynamic environment reacts to it by its various perspectives. To a certain extent, our reflection might relate how a anything that exists in the environment might try to control the effects of interaction it promotes or might to a certain extent foster creativity and expansion. 

If anything in our spaces brings a message - enabling us to understand or to spread the word or to be part of it - our day to day interaction with the things gives something more than that which I will ask us to consider it as a platform. It doesn't matter, again, if it's a cup of coffee, a book, a donut, everything can be seen as a platform to a certain extent is given by interactions from many entities, interactions that sustains the thing as it is, interactions that may eventually refactor the thing, more or less, making it stable or subject to an evolution. A potential for growth of the platform might also be considered, which has to do with how the thing-as-a-platform creates value in the environment. As an example, from an eatable item, let us consider something that in Brazilis called "coxinha," which is basically a ball of dough stuffed with shredded chicken shapped to look like a chicken thigh and then deep fried. Many bakeries have it in Brazil although each may have their own style. In one particular instance, near to a place I lived, we had one that were big and oily - to the point that it would turn to transparent some of the surfaces that it touches. One day I wanted to inform the lady working at my apartment about how disgusting it were and but when I were about to say "The coxinha from that XYZ bakery is.. " she completed saying ".. delicious." I was puzzled but then one day after I quit my job and became an entrepreneur and had to eat that coxinha for lunch - instead of as a snack in the afternoon  - I were able to fully appreciate the power of its size and even were proud of its oily condition. I would say that the coxinha from that bakery is platform, an eatable for survival, an item that supports the business, and a lot more such the relationship with the sources that regulates its materialization as a continous production or process or experience, such as regulations given by the leadership, customers, and even the government. Coxinha exists and won't die anytime soon. Also, the coxinha is not patented which explains its widespread accross many states in Brazil. 

To point another example, consider the books of Harry Potter. For many, especially among non-readers, these books might be just about an experience of leisure or entertainment, a great book of fiction or literature. On the other hand, for the actual readers of literature, it means more. But more than that, there are groups that meet through Harry Potter - as a platform - and take the experience to a whole other level. According to Casper Ter Kuile, in *The Power of Rituals*, there are books that can bring people together in ways that competes with that communiy groups, such as churches or religious organizations do. To get to that, Casper had identified some of the essential elements that made churches to stand by the identification of values that are preset horizontally accross many churches - Intention, Attention, Repetition, and Community. In other words, Harry Potter brings foundational elements that makes the book to become a platform that put people together like a community, where they they can experience the world, they can grow as individuals and with connections as a community, and can transcend. 

<!--

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Space - Check Casper ter Kuile elements - @meta-refid 1222-2334-8788-8383
--> 

One other implication from the abstraction elements taken from these communities as platforms - if you will - is that, as reported by Casper, we happened to be exercising these elements in the digital and interactive world, although it may be confusing likely because of the technolgical barriers that unless you are within the community one can't get it what goes on and could even dismiss what is happening as irrelevant; not unlike non-readers dismiss the power of Harry Potter as a platform. But the point is that if Harry Potter can compete with the platform equivalent of a church - of the old days - in new and even in better ways - then too many new platforms are too in fact exercising creating the conditions and for an interaction dynamics that enable users to get together, as a community, and live the experience. 








Now a slight complication to get what goes on with the rise of interactive platforms is exactly that value creation can be captured from the platform too and that in many situations the entrepreneurs themselves, or the other parties involved such as the ones that have a stake in the whole system, may not get exaclty the potential and or might be trapped themselves by forces of the environment thus being unable, or not interested, in enablig certain values even to not recognize values that may take the platform to die or to reach its saturation state. To be clear, by value creation we may consider a simple example that a church can launch an event in the network and make a call and pass a hat to collect resources from its community of users, or calling them to go to the field, it does not matter. Accordinly, and not different from the passing of a hat, many platforms can mobilize their communities to get involved in actions too.  






##### From Nestcape to Mozilla to Firefox 

Thus, and to celebrate these challenges of ourselves figuring value and the pressures from value, let us start by considering a case I have mentioned before, the rise of the Mozilla project, but now to consider how the unbundling of Netscape and the bundling of Mozilla project gave rise of an iconic browser project made by thousands of contributors worldwide. If we recount from history, Mozilla project, the open-source code for a browser, was the response from Netscape as Microsoft had bundled its own browser in their Windows operating system - thus serving the Internet navigation needs of its users. The movement, given that Netscape were bleeding fast, was led by creative leaders that trusted that the growing open-source movement would give a new beginning for Netscape. A main challenge was the necessity of rewriting Netscape's proprietary code - which were millions of lines of code according to Code Rush documentary (Project Code Rush, 2013) - which involved doing it in ways compatible with the open-source characterizations and in ways to leverage the interaction of contributors from all over the world; essentially enabling the co-creation with the wider community. 

Now, and as history shows, from Mozilla open-source project not widely known in 1998 - except by these pioneers - to Firefox the browser reached 30% of the browser market in a decade [^footnote_firefox_peak], the journey consisted in solving a lot of challenges in order for a rich collaborative framework to thrive. One example of the many important buildin blocks were a system known as Bugzilla [^footnote_mozilla_bugzilla] which enabled contributors to report problems (bugs as they call), to discuss how to solve them, and to contribute with code solving them. Therefore, Bugzilla along with many other building blocks, like the Mozilla open-source license, represented the essential managerial work that responded to the needs of a wider community that were eager to collaborate. The impact, besides the outcomes visible at the surface, was a strong community, the Mozilla community, that grew in structured, that became a well of knowledge and value creation, which enabled the actual interactions from volunteers from all over the world that brought the outcome of "a significant difference in the improvement of the product," as Jim Barksdale expected, and a lot more. 

[^footnote_firefox_peak]: Firefox reached a peak market share of 32.21% in November 2009. For more details, see the Wikipedia article on Firefox and check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#cite_note-StatCounter-23 the referenced source. 

[^footnote_mozilla_bugzilla]: For information about Bugzilla, a web-based general-purpose bug tracker and testing tool originally developed and used by the Mozilla project, see the Wikipedia article - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugzilla.

In other words, the setting of Mozilla as an internet browser, given the open-source initial movement and the wider input of a community that believed in openness, led Mozilla to grow as a strong product and to even motivate many other companies to work again in browsers. In other words, Mozilla had enabled the growth of Firefox because it had exercised too a phenomenon of co-creation which is essentially when the user develops further interactions with the platorm leading to innovation [^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation_2]. 

[^footenote_ericvonhippel_userinnovation_2]: 








##### Linkedin and network potential tied seen through the goggles of product-market fit 



Another illustration for the challenges of building a platform and how serious and strategic should be the managerial work is recounted by the founders of LinkedIn. Although today it is easy to see LinkedIn as a social network for our professional identity, it wasn't entirely clear when they launched in 2003. Sure, they had a direction such as to be a social network for the professional identity, but to know the stable condition that would sustain growth for the network through value was another mather. Thus, they faced a particular challenge which is quite evident in the case of social and highly interactive platforms which is that what appears to be the shortest path to get there may not be the best strategy. Allen Blue, one of the LinkedIn cofounders, gave a great picture of that situation where Linkedin and other competitors were in a "race to scale," but one that required lots of strategic thinking. In retrospect, he suggested that some of their competitors had failed because they moved quickly to launch advanced features or to monetize while Linkedin leadership had engaged in a serious work to identify what were the main thing to focus in order for them to achieve true value of the network "before they actually had effective value to sell" (Greylock, 2015).


<!--
@quote ref 
> *"When we launched LinkedIn, within two or three months, there were three other competitive products, all of which were heading for the same space, which entered the market during that time. ... they were all tiny little companies that were trying to build product market fit. ... It's a race to scale and the reason that it actually worked out for us and it didn't work out for them is because we took this very seriously. ... [while] They moved very quickly to advanced features and they moved very quickly to 'how do I monetize this?' Without actually locking in the market share necessary to make the thing successful. So they were trying to build features on top of and try to sell the product before they actually had effective value to sell. And that meant we got to continue to concentrate on growth ... to move on"* (Allen Blue in Greylock, 2015, 9:53).

--> 

The point given is, therefore, that the exercise is challenging, especially in the beginning when the the various potentials are being considered by the community is not there yet making it real. For Allen, it was challengin that Linkedin didn't have yet a feedback loop in place exactly telling them; which required them to trust and to reflect and to think through seriously likely outside some of the basic pressures such as to make money now. Consider Allen's note their speculations about that space of a potential value - which he refers as product-market fit - given by the relationships with one of their potential customers - recruiters - but all of that provoking them to consider that something would need to be done - in their case growth across U.S. -  for that to potentially become real: 

> *"You know what, we had potential product market fit. Yeah, because we had identified, for instance, recruiters are a great example. Recruiters absolutely loved the concept of the product, but the problem is when they went and searched, the search base was too small. But the product market fit was actually there, but only with those specific people who could envision what it would be like when we had a ton of people on the network"* (Allen Blue in Greylock, 2015, 14:40).

Likewise, needless to say, they went further, they found the means, they had built the bridge across the U.S., they brought themselves to a sustainable condition where value were flowing through that bridge, adding value to more than one side, and also to the side of the investors, allowing them to continue to grow, and that linked them to transcend towards new challenges of growth in alignment with the Blitzscaling (2018) movement.

#### Rethink this in another place



In alignment with the thoughts from Storybrand, another enlightening development from the world of marketing is brought by the authors of Play Bigger (2016), as they elaborate the notion of *Category Design* which consists of a reframing of problems where a new narrative not only recognizes a significant problem - or a set of problems - but is brought in ways that the audience recognizes it as unique - as a category - in new ways of thinking about the problem as in to where the solution and narrative is a pathway to how the world could look like. This way of thinking help us too to understand great solutions like Uber and Apple's music player the iPod. If we go back to what *Jobs To Be Done* had given to us about the Ipod case, we may recall that it had acessed the job of listening to music but spanning through multiple job steps - not only one or other job steps within the job - such as to solve the ways to prepare, to organize, to play / execute, to monitor, and more. Thus, it is a case when a technological advancement forms a solid message to users; because we remember more clear when we "hire" a solution that solves a job by a new pathway that is much simple.

> *"A POV has to shift people’s minds so they reject an old way of thinking and come to believe in something new. It has to reach people on an emotional level. No one remembers what you say—but they remember how you made them feel. That feeling can be excitement about something that’s coming, or fear of missing out. Some of the best POVs make people think: “Oh fuck, I don’t have one of those! I have to get one of those!” To reach people’s emotions, a POV has to sound the way people talk. It has to be simple, direct, visceral. Language matters."* (Ramadan et al., 2016, p. XX)

Another key aspect, for any entrepreneurial effort that consider these ideas, is to consider how the development of a vision - for a brand and a product and the lives of the users being guided by them - may also set the team in a direction being less arbitrary and driven by these aspirations. In other words, solving the equation helps not only the world and the users and also the team to move on. Likewise, not an easy job to achive the level of clarity.
