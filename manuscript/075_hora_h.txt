## The things that happen in "hour H"

* Principles, Pillars
* Delayed answer
* Protagonism

Who never went through a situation of having given an answer that he regretted, under pressure. Hence, when the event passes, comes that second thought, free from pressure, that comes to conclusions about what should have been said, what could be done - too late.

So, we know that "hour H" is not the time to think and we end up operating by making a quick choice. Worse is that the mental model ends up influencing us even in situations where we have time to think; there is a lot of situations that appear to be "hour H" and we fall into the trap - we ourselves create pressure, since many times the other side doesn't care (the other side would be the consumer, the partner, the judge, the investor, the council member, the mother, etc.).

Perhaps the most urgent and most procedural world has created this situation. Perhaps even the other side is pressuring us (harassing?) Even when the situation does not ask. So the first thing about "hour H" that we must keep in mind is that many of the situations that demand our decision "on the hour" or "in the minute" are not really the case, we are just allowing ourselves to enter into this area of ​​urgency, or because we are deceiving ourselves or because we fall into the trap of other people or systems.

Entrepreneur Glen, from Redfin, talked about How to deal with advice, about his experience in situations where board members asked for an answer - he said that before, he was under pressure, he thought that as an entrepreneur he should give an answer "on the spot" . But he learned that he could say "I don't know" that it was okay to indicate "I don't know" followed by "let me think about it for a while and I'll get back to you with an answer."

Having to respond at "hour H" refers to the "heat of the circumstances", and reveals the truth about the pressure, whether it is pressure from the environment, from people, from the situation. Pressure will always exist, time H will come, circumstances will be hot, unexpected, adverse, complex and challenging. In this sense, in this chapter, we are not trying to avoid adversity in front of us, but to increase our chances of dealing with these events that demand our immediate decision or thinking.

The strategy starts with self-respect because you need a pillar to deal with these situations. The first pillar is: you have principles and you don't want to leave them alone. If you don't know, you don't have to say you do. This does not mean that you have to leave the person alone, ignore it. That is, there are ways to not know and still give due attention. By sticking to your principles you do not put yourself in complicated situations, which can consume a lot of you to remedy and still consume because the fact that not doing something you like does not do you good, drains your energy for these situations and with that you you may want to avoid similar situations.

Since you don't break your principles, you should depress the situation, as Glen did in front of his board members. Let's see, Glen was an entrepreneur and the board members were important people; so it is normal for the entrepreneur to feel pressure, for example for having ready answers; perhaps a cultural pressure from the daily life of the corporate world or the executive world. But Glen, managed to escape this mental model because he understood that it would be worse to give a wrong answer and also had a more conscious view that takes into account several points of view - he should not answer everything as his immediate view. As an entrepreneur and as a representative (CEO) of the company, it is his responsibility to answer for the company, that is, it is normal for certain responses to take longer as he has to consult others, reflect, etc.

Board members never asked for immediate answers - it's CEOs who want to look confident that they do. What members wanted is serious engagement and a response. A right answer is better later than an immediate wrong decision, especially when you have the reins of an entire company in your hands.

Still, as an entrepreneur, this attitude of not responding "in the can" but carrying on the challenge until you find the answer is a great example that should be given by the chief executive, so other people in the company will also do the same.

In addition to the principles, and pillars and the depressurization of the situation, you still have other ways to deny the whole situation - but that is not giving up and it may be if you actually take the lead. Whoever has never been in front of that situation where a certain offer is about to expire, 3, 2, .. and the seller, supplier or whoever it is is in front of you putting you in the difficult situation of having to decide to give an answer. It is worth remembering that these situations should not exist, not in this way. If you cannot think about peace, if you cannot ask for help, if you cannot consult external systems, if you cannot compare, you are probably in front of a trap, which was not even premeditated, which is not evil. Perhaps whoever put you in it simply does it on impulse or external force, like culture, or politics, system or procedure, etc.

Worse is that many times these situations can appear with the face of opportunity like "the super offer will expire". One way of thinking, which helps to get out of these situations, is to assume the protagonism - if you are the protagonist you will not need to depend on the chance of the situations like lightning offers. It may even seem that you are doing well because in front of you there was an expiring offer but look at the world now it offers expiring offers in abundance. You can also act out of the need zone, so you can be out of that situation.

### The other side of the hour H

It is that when you arrive, in your urgent schedule, say in a store, and there is a "H hour" situation, you are passionate to decide without the information you like. But remember that the other side is not on time because the other side everything has already been thought out and sometimes even planned. While for you it was on time H for the other it was programmed, it was prodecural.
