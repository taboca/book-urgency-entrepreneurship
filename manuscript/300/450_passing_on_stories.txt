In the world of entrepreneurship, we often venerate winners and their stories. Their inspiring stories can guide entrepreneurs to listen, become motivated, and certainly to act. But when it comes to building our own narratives, our tendency to accelerate towards successful outcomes - such as the winning numbers - can become a source of distraction that can mislead teams from achieveing solid results. 

Our focus in this section is an oppoortunity to look at how entrepreneurs use storytelling, how we come to believe and act on the basis of stories.

In the book It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work, Jason and David, calls our attention to a language that the business world is obsessed with. They call our attention to action-oriented themes that visceraly invite us into things such as "Let's double the market", "Who is getting which awards?", "Who is raising money?", and so on. For them, it is a "language of war" that fills out the skies of the entrepreneurial landscape. Or more likely, it clouds.

> "Sadly, it's not easy to escape the business tropes of war and conquest. Every media outlet has a template for describing rival companies as warring factions. Sex sells, wars sell, and business battles serve as financial-page porn. " (2018, P.21)

Is it that the storytelling of what really goes on is too boring and does not sell? In part, indeed, it makes sense that there is a lot of successful stories that doesn't not have room for failure, or for the longer-boring language of work as opposed to the language of war. And inded it might be a "language of war" not in the sense that we are excited with visceral things but because of the storytelling of war that generally presents a narrative oriented to outcomes, such as what one gets after the fact that they fight, when they fight, and if they win. 

As we dig towards giving us more responsibility, and not blame the world even if all stories were a lie, I invite us consider that we, as entrepreneurs, are the ones engaging, and listening and acting, with these things that sells, giving our likes, and echoying these things that sells. The complication is that we fall for a paradigm where we seek out for good reasons to buy-in things, to listen, and to act. And outcomes, such as "winning the market" are good reasons for us. 

But as Jason and David wrote, that is "a paradigm which does not make sense." Especially for entrepreneurs, as they have to focus on what matters, as they have limited resources, as they need to be strategic. This paradigm acts on our motivations to the cause, why we do it, and also on our roadmap, how we do it. As for the why we do it, Steve Blank reminds founders of the dangers of chasing the prize: 

> "You need to do what you are doing because you love it, because you can’t think of anything better to do with your life. And if that is not the case, don’t do this because it’s going to be a miserable 10 or 20 years. If you are looking at getting rich like the Facebook boys, or the Google boys, or whatever the hot startup is now, that is the wrong reason to do it. If you are chasing the money, I will guarantee you, the more you chase it, the further away is goes." (Steve Blank at MAP14, Mar 13, 2014, 34m33s)

But as we dig for the "how we do it", as teams execute and learne simultaneously, our tendency to use this paradigm for chasing "the prizes" might have more to do with the way we communicate and reason, and less with our obsession for money, market, or prizes. What I invite us to consider the narrative paradigm which can support us to think that founders are more of Homo narrans than sapiens. 

<!-- 

* teased - learning 

--> 

In this direction, starting with the obvious, we need to acknowledge that focusing on outcomes is a great feature of humans. It's on our alpha nature that we first target a salmon after having good reasons. And we found our ways to capture and bring back to our homes in a stick. Therefore, having an outcome in sight is a requirement that help us find our way to get solve the problem. 

After stating an outcome, which is a language that pulls us towards the action of capturing the outcome, it comes the question of how to achieve. For that we use comparisons. In the "language of war", one could be after something that the other has it, such as the marketshare of a competitor. Comparison is in us to help us decide with less analysis, quickly. According to Michael Dearing, "these are things you have instinctively in you as a human being, who makes discriminating choices between one thing and another thing that might be better." (Dearing, M. (2013, July 16))

We know that, when we wear shopping hats, when we pick the cheaper or the better. And we also know the cost of being stuck in analysis such as when we are in a hurry. 

> "Lots of companies are driven by comparisons in general. Not just wether they're first, second or third in their industry, but how they stack up feature for feature with their closest competitors. " David and Jason, (2018, P.22)

Connecting the dots, we can conclude that for the situations that we have things to compare, we can do a reasonably good job, of comparing. We do that quick as opposed to doing analysis which takes time. But the complication, especially for founders, is that we have lots of things to shop as we seek out to make the recipes of our companies. 

In the supermarket of entrepreneurship, we have an aisle for many aspects, such as market aspects where we can find labels such as "Let's us dominate the market," among others. In the aisle of features, we can learn, or better compare, about how to implement the feature of a competitor. But also, there are other labels in aisles like methodologies, advices, customers, and so on. 

The analogy of the supermarket does justice to the situation of founders as it points that they listen and act based on storytelling that conveys good reasons. The complication for them is not unlike the life of a hungry customer in a supermarket that is in the right place and in the right time, from the point of view of what sells. In the right moment, the presentation of a label, is enough for a decision to buy. Similarly, in the right moment and time, the entrepreneur will buy-in into actions as they listen to storytelling that has good reasons, as they compare their options. Comparing works much better than doing the full analysis, and it is the way to leave analysis paralysis which is something that founders fear as they have seen a lot of labels saying that analysis paralysis is bad. 

## The Lean Dilemma

Renowned entrepreneur Eric Ries in his book The Startup Way [^ericriesonfoundersnolean] discusses a complication that comes in the way of founders as they advance with the lean startup methodology. He provoke founders pointing an intriguing trend that emerges when entrepreneurs often abandon the lean methodology once they find a promising lead. It's akin to an urgency mode kicking in, driving them to forego the principles that initially brought them to iterate and to learn. 

[^ericriesonfoundersnolean]:

Therefore, even if they enter "safe zones" of lean, and learn, Eric's point suggests that startups fall that instinctive tendency. In other words, we find "good reasons" to switch modes. As an example, these good reasons can be found in the aisle of growth which brings a lot of solutions and good reasons for a founder to buy-in and act. Natural questions when walking this aisle are: At some point we gotta scale? Once we get product-market fit, and so on. 

What is intrinsic, in the art and science of entrepreneurship, is that the story we tell ourselves is also part in influencing the "good reasons" for the next steps.  Since nothing much there in the first place, we can rest knowing that the process often start with narrative, a story of how founders start, which indeed might have roots in personal individual values, or it could be based on "good reasons" of the founders to join a calling [^steveblankcalling]. 

But since nothing is there, and that it does not make sense to have a strict business plan for what is next [^stevenobusinessplansurvives], founders have to satisfy themselves by understanding that what hold them together is a story. One that compells then to work, to try, to learn, and to execute, towards their goals. And as they do, as expectations and goals are set, they seek out models to supports them to manage themselves, as resources, so that hopefully they can bring a value proposition for a potential market. 

[^stevenobusinessplansurvives]: 

Now, as indicated by the process, learning is involved so that the next phase of investment can be activated - either more funding, more resources, scaling needs, productization, and more. Implicit in this process is the idea that someone is observing, the judges, being the team or others supporting peers. Any learning effort that goes on, with a plan of execution (good or bad) will only happen in a period of time and should arrive at a presentation in front of a hypothetical judge that will approve the next phase. The judges can be the founders approving themselves as resources to try again, do a new cycle, keep on going, you name it. 

Therefore, for the approaval phase to happen, a narrative has to exist. This need creates an anchor to founders. Influencing the narratives that they tell themselves, analysis reports and other narratives that may fill the details for a presentation. This format invaribly involves founders advancing as they do analysis for a general narrative that attempts to add the supporting data related to their ideas, guesses or hypothesis, data and interpretation of their incomplete tests, interpretations of responses such as feedback from early users, and other partial analysis. 

Looking at founders as the ones carrying on narratives, they can be seen as protagonists of their entrepreneurial efforts and that they act to construct a narrative that presents good reasons for themselves, and others such as users and investors, to act, to trust. Looking using this perspective, I invite you to consider the idea that founders serve as great examples of the Homo narrans ("storytelling human") [^walterfisherhomonarrans], a metaphor for humans as beings that coordinates meaningful communication via storytelling and where where they participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. 

Consider a question in the cover of Walter Fisher's book [is it possible to fix this reference as I indicated a reference to the cover?] entitled Human Communication as Narration, which posits a question "How do people come to believe and to act on the basis of communicative experiences?" 

His work can be considered provocative in front of the assumption that communication, in the end of the day, carries rationality, under the viewpoint that in the end of the day, logic in communication conquers the world of communication, which suggestffs that communication that is available, in the end, pushes us in the right direction. That sort of makes a bit of sense, doesn't it? As in, that poor communication, or illogical communication, does not have a place, or that it cannot persist too long. At least, we hope. Or, in other words, we might have good reasons to believe in that. I believe in that as I am, in the end of the day, an optimist. I want to believe that the big story with communication, from a wider or zoomed out place, is a good story full of logic, that all communication especially in the entrepreneurial world should carry a good logic. 

Although the thinking that communication has to be driven by rational elements, such as logic that appears in it's cargo, Walter Fisher sheds a light to help us to see the ways that we use communication that are sometimes not so logic but still pushes the world forward. The reason, my own good reasons here that I am look at Walter Fisher work, is because it seems to help to explain the world we live in, the current networked world. 

Walter points that the entrance door for one that hears, that listens, has less to do with logic and reason, and more to do with storytelling. That is not to imply that we love to use good stories to justify our actions with no regard to rationality, logic, or reasoning. But it is like an entrance door. As written in the foreword in his book, "Later we learn more sophisticated criteria and standards for assessing a story's fidelity and coherence, but constructing, interpreting, and evaluating discourse as "story" remains our primary, innate, species-specific 'logic.'" (p. xx) 

Now, before I move on, I have to tell you that I am here simply bringing a perspective to prompt us - founders t - to reflect. [Here I want to make the case that communication seems and it is logical in ways, that the long run might actually have mechanisms to test.] It seems logical to provoke how founders use communication with the lenses of, as indicated, that very question from the back of Fisher's book, "how do people come to believe and act on the basis of communicative experiences."  It seems to be a good question to make, especially now that we live in the days of the social networks, and where many authors such as Max Fisher, are writing books (such as The Chaos Machine) and saying outloud to us that we live in a world that too many people are propagating news without checking, and, as a consequence of that, too many people are indeed believing and acting on the basis of communicative experiences. 

So, even if do not go all the way, towards the idea that we are more of a Homo narrans ][^homonarrans] than sapiens, still, if the point of us here is to reflect about the urgencies of the world, that pushes us to act in ways that can be bad for us, why not at least to invite us to reflect, for the context of entrepreneurs. So, here we are, let's consider for the moment that we are, in a way, operating our days by listening to stories and doing a storytelling check first, then to think later. At this point, I also would like to point that if our brains has a means to "check the storytelling" first before an more deep analysis of what was said, this might also show a sort of same pattern like in a way what the acceleration systems of entrepreneurship does, as you can read in the chapter Accelerated Systems [check if it is before or after and check how to refer to that in good way for the reader I mean how top writers make reference to other articles in the same book, is it possible to refer as footnote or with a citation that cites the same book? ]ios








Let's consider for a moment that what we do essentially has more to do with storytelling, as Homo narrans. A theory of Walter Fisher, known as the Narrative paradigm, claims that human communication occurs from our participation as storytellers or observers of narratives. The provoking point about the theory is that stories are more persuasive than arguments. Our capacity to grasp and retain ideas often hinges on storytelling, an intrinsic human trait. We learn, discern values, and act based on the narratives we encounter. Imagine someone who's never tried an orange. A persuasive story from a friend about their first delicious encounter might be the nudge needed to inspire a taste test.

By following this line of thinking, let's consider that we live out narratives and with that, that we understand, or measure, our lives, and consequently inclinations to do things, in terms of narratives that we evaluate. 

Now, by just focusing in storytelling, we are likely to understand that founders are not driven only based on that main aspect. We know that they have to be good storytellers, but also that what they try to create, in the end of the day, will need to pass a big test, the real test, in front of ultimately the ones that can accept or deny the product. The real judges, such as customers. We don't deny that the end has to bring value and has to be concrete. 

Still, our attention here, as we consider the process, is that a lot of support that founders get has to do with the judgements that they do themselves, and by the others that they are contacting on their way. In addition, that they need to be organized and coordinate actions by telling themselves stories of how they are doing, how they are executing. The complication for them is that the actual storytelling of the execution will naturally deal with data that is more or less accurate. In other words, the methods they use, in the early stages and through discovery, are lean methods that naturally don't guarantees success at the next stop. If we consider tools such as the MVP, business model canvas, or customer discovery; all of these are iterative solutions to help them to get data, or fragments of data, that are to be interpreted subjectively based on founders knowledge, and becomes information inserted in their stories to support the call, such as a yes or no, for the next stage of investment. 

But as we dive in the process, if we zoom in, we will see that storytelling is applied by the hour, as events are happening, as execution happens. To give colorful case, consider the "72h rule" created by Steve Blank to help teams to control the impulses of a CEO - that leaves the building to do interviews - that comes back with a story that seem to present good reasons to pivot. 

<!-- 

MAP14. (2014, March 13). MAP14 Public Forum: Steve Blank. [video]. Retrieved from https://youtu.be/UFx2CQUTpYo

--> 

The case presented by Steve shows how storytelling conveys partial data and compells the participants to act. It would be the case when the CEO presents its good reasons for a "let's pivot!" And as well, it is the case when the team stops that CEO with good reasons for "keeping your mouth shut, from when you think you got an insight do when you are allowed to announce the word pivot." (Steve Blank @ MAP14, 2014,  24m34s)

A CEO, when confronted with that strong saying, have a lot of reasons to trust the team too, as like a good classical story, the indicated rule might have being said in the right time and space and might pull a truth in it. Thus, the rule does not lie. It could be that it serves a purpose in the process but it may also influence the process. 

Thus, what is implicit in the doing of lean is a relationship with storytelling. We use storytelling to advance. But, of course, there is nothing wrong with that. But it serves as an alert of our propensity to decide for action x or y using stories. And a reminder for us that, when the clock is ticking, sticking with a story that supports decision is generally applauded. We need to be pragmatic, in the end of the day, we need to move. And, again, there is nothing wrong with that. As the process, as we know it, will ultimately reveal the truth, in the end of the days. 

As we delve into the process, consider how entrepreneurs might utilize storytelling not only to guide but also to feed their actions, akin to what communication theorists Frentz and Farrell term as episodes: "a rule-conforming sequence of symbolic acts generated by two or more actors who are collectively oriented towards emergent goals." 

Although this definition could be applicable to stories such as fiction stories, we can't deny that the definition of it does a good job that a lot of what founders do as they document their steps, their episodes. Consider that plus the undeniable, or implicit aspect, that they can't track what they do at all times by rewatching all the episodes that they have done. Therefore, as we advance projects, we are likely advancing a wider story with the episodes towards a general "climax" which guides a general outcome narrative, such as a final presentation which is presented in the context of the mission. 

And again, nothing wrong with that. But the complication is that as much as we like to have the truths, and facts, that tell us that we are in the right direction, still the process in itself is about experiencing, experimenting, learning, and creating new abstractions, conveyed in stories, intended to do the cycle again. We advance by summing support that will be presented as a short story to an audience, themselves or other partners in the process such as an investor. The next step, the judgment call, likely involves a supposedly external process of risk analysis. [^riskanalysisofvc]

[^riskanalysisofvc]: 

The supporting elements, to move on with new investments, becomes the stories we craft after our discoveries, and how others perceive our stories which may or may not involve data analysis, of course, as indicated by "risk analysis" the checking process is not totally done as data is incomplete. Another factor that the venture capital world confirms is that the early stage trust is tied with the reputation and credibility of founders. [^foundersreputation]. 

[^foundersreputation]: 

Consider how the community around founders is generally influential to help founders continue to move, or to try again, or continue to improve in the current line of development. The power dynamics is always present too and noticed when the CEO says something, when someone says that the data says something, that a mentor said something, the judges of an accelerator program, investors, potential customers, and so on. 

A case that is common is when an early customer is inclined to buy. This is quite powerful even when there is no product or what the customer wants is in fact not part of the goal. Many founders jump to getting that customer as it rings the bell that cash is coming in. That pulls effort for someone to try to put that into the story and can be quite powerful to promote a new direction if it fits as good reasons. 

But again, nothing too wrong that. But it serves to illustrate that revenue projection can also support telling a story for changing a direction, even to prompt founders into a conflicting decision, or to look for a new mission, but it is undeniable that a lot of these prompts in the early stage come from arbitrary interactions with arbitrary customers that had arbitrary needs. 

The complication is tied to the expectations, such as measurement expectations, which naturally pulls the team to make decisions as opposed to keep trying and exercising the lean cycle again and again. The story that they need to succeed with lean becomes in itself another storytelling that influences their actions. Consider the question that 
Rohan Workman asked to Steve Blank, if he has seen when founders claim that they are doing lean versus talking about lean. Steve Blank acknowledged that as a disorder that affects founders when they get enamored with the process. 

Consider how strong it can be the data "from the real world" for a group of founders that were in a prior condition where they never left the room where they kept idealizing too much in theory, as hypothesis. Wouldn't be the case that, perhaps, their act of going out and "get the data" to become fascinating and inspire them to consider the external event as real data or good reasons? And, again, there is nothing wrong with that, of course, as talking with someone, a real customer, can be fascinating in contrast with idealizing things in front of a digital screen. So important and interesting that the very fact of contrasting with the prior situation, poorer situation, becomes a good reason perhaps for a new decision. 

These illustrations are here to help us to execute these processes, the episodes of a lean process, with more tolerance to the results and awareness. Since awareness is key to any process, and founders generally suffer from being enamored with the process, it becomes the founder’s responsibility first to recognize such syndrome; then second, to find for ways to ensure the process is running with quality. But them, wait, what is quality right? Is quality related to control? Consider Scott Belsky’s view about faiure from Making Ideas Happen:

> “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity. Stay strong and stay calm as a situation settles itself over time and the clouds around any period of change start to dissipate. “ (Scott Belsky, 2010, Making Ideas Happen)

<!--

Belsky, Scott. (2010). Making Ideas Happen. London, England: Portfolio.

-->

This view perhaps support us towards the idea of the knowing that the process and our presence to tell stories, is likely affecting the whole proces. This notion, when embraced, can provoke founders to be in a more humble position which improves them into listening even more and to do the craft, such as to pull data and advance episodes, but to know that all their did had to do with their effort with limited data, as limited beings, influencing the story and the storytelling. As they say that, upfront, they keep a reminder to them, and to the audiences, and also open the door to get more data from external minds. The improvemet of quality derives from that listening condition and may improve when they engage with an advisory board as a body responsible for an outside perspective therefore supporting the founder to get out from instant pressures, and compromising decisions: 

> "That is why you need an advisory board, or board of directors, who is coaching the founders on this because you could get enamorated with the process and confused that the last person to blow on your ear, actually have a valid insight."  (Steve Blank @ MAP14, 2014, 24m51s)

Now the general indication of having an advisory board needs a reflection as it may make sense that there is an absurdity. That because a board of directors are, in general, known and applicable as necessary for large companies. Therefore, there is a general understanding that ignoring a board of directors is a good thing. 

But the reflection is key in establishing the idea of the "entity" of a board of directions, or the role of them. Consider the view For professor and investor Michael Dearing, for why founders need a governance approach: 

> "I need to make sure that somebody is looking at this who isn't just me. Who can critique the strategy it might be an advisor it might be a trusted colleague it might be a cofounder." Michael Dearing. (Greylock, 2015 October 8, 1:00:00) 

Now, we need to be sensible that an early team might not even be able to find a good external eyes to help them there. But the early founders should keep in mind that they need to construct their own system of support to save them from their bad narratives. Michal goes on to indicate that the key point is to seek to create a valuable function of a shock absorber that does the function of checking the progress of founders.

I didn’t work for him but I worked for somebody who worked for him and the whole idea there was — every big good idea is going to be subjected to a devil’s advocate case. And somebody, probably the smartest person he could find, is going to be in charge of trying to destroy your idea.

Chat gpt on cognitive behavior vs. narrative 

The narrative paradigm has been used in business research to analyze the narratives or stories told by CEOs and other business leaders. These narratives often shape the culture, identity, and strategy of a business. A few relevant sources are:

"Narrative and the Practice of Strategy" (Vaara et al., 2016)
"Building Theories of Organization: The Constitutive Role of Communication" (Putnam et al., 2009)
"The Role of Narratives in Sustaining Organizational Innovation" (Sonenshein, 2010)
These studies, among others, examine how narratives or storytelling are used by leaders to engage employees, enact strategies, and influence organizational culture and innovation.

Regarding cognitive distortions, it's reasonable to surmise that these would influence a leader's storytelling. Cognitive distortions, which are irrational or exaggerated thought patterns, can affect how one perceives and interprets information, including one's own experiences and the behavior of others. This could certainly affect the kinds of narratives a leader constructs and shares. However, as of my last update in 2021, I do not have specific research on the connection between cognitive distortions and storytelling in leadership.

It's a fascinating area for further exploration and it may be that there has been more recent research on this topic. Keep in mind that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques are often used to address cognitive distortions, and these techniques can include narrative components, which further highlights the potential connection between these areas.
