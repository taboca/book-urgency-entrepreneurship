In the world of entrepreneurship, we often venerate winners and their stories. Their narratives of what is being told become beacons that guide entrepreneurs and their stories. From a motivational standpoint, no one denies that stories of successful organizations - such as the quests of successful founders - are inspiring. But when it comes to what goes on, the real stories of what happens and matters, we fall short. Although there is no intention to document stories distorted [how come this?], what is taken from the stories - as narrated - fails to embody the bigger picture of what goes on and what makes a difference in terms of guiding entrepreneurs and their journeys. In this article, we will focus how on storytelling affects entrepreneurship. Or better, how entrepreneurship is affected by storytelling. And especially, as we know, how our quick reaction to what we hear and say affects even more. 

<!-- 

The above SCqA is: 

Situation - What is being told affect us. To inspire and to run. 
Situation - The storytelling we use is the one that sticks. 
Complication - What sticks does not help in many situations. 
Question - What to do? 
Answer - Learn how we use storytelling, the input and output, our tendency to run by stories, as human. As teams, and the impact for positive and bad. And as systems, how to regulate. 

--> 

One question that comes naturally is to wonder if the world - of how things are told - does not care about telling us truths of what happens, such as the longer version of all sucesssful stories. As an optimist for entrepreneurship, I can't say that. If we dig, we will see that good thoughts are everywhere. In addition, entrepreneurs need to act responsibility and not blame the world, even if all stories were a lie. We are the ones seeking truths. In this direction, I rather use our reflective moment to start with an inquiry: What is up with us when we deal with stories. What goes on that pushes us to act and decide based on stories. And especially now, that our entrepreneurial world is hyperconnected, what pulls us towards pursuing the status of a story more than what leads to a real good story. 

In the book It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work, Jason and David, calls our attention to a language that the business world is obsessed with. They call our attention to action-oriented themes that visceraly invite us into things such as "Let's double the market", "Who is getting which awards?", "Who is raising money?", and so on. It is a "language of war" that fills out the skies of the entrepreneurial landscape. Or more likely, it clouds. 

> "Sadly, it's not easy to escape the business tropes of war and conquest. Every media outlet has a template for describing rival companies as warring factions. Sex sells, wars sell, and business battles serve as financial-page porn. " (2018, P.21)

But it called my attention when they frame as "as a paradigm which does not make sense." This viewpoint offers an opportunity for us to consider that we, as entrepreneurs, might be the ones that are using what is out there, in the first place, trusting what seems to be "what sells" and giving the Likes to the things that sells, echoying the things that sells. What if all the truths are there but we can only see what is being shared? But even more complicated, than our inclination to love the thing that sells and to act as if it would work, is our propensity to push our actions, to believe and act, likewise with a sort of storytelling that sells. Consider a question in the cover of Walter Fisher's book entitled Human Communication as Narration, which posits a question "How do people come to believe and to act on the basis of communicative experiences?" 

## Entrepreneurs belive and act based on storytelling 

His work can be considered provocative in front of the assumption that communication, in the end of the day, carries rationality, under the viewpoint that in the end of the day, logic in communication conquers the world of communication, which suggests that communication that is available, in the end, pushes us in the right direction. That sort of makes a bit of sense, doesn't it? As in, that poor communication, or illogical communication, does not have a place, or that it cannot persist too long. At least, we hope. Or, in other words, we might have good reasons to believe in that. I believe in that as I am, in the end of the day, an optimist. I want to believe that the big story with communication, from a wider or zoomed out place, is a good story full of logic, that all communication especially in the entrepreneurial world should carry a good logic. 

Although the thinking that communication has to be driven by rational elements, such as logic that appears in it's cargo, Walter Fisher sheds a light to help us to see the ways that we use communication that are sometimes not so logic but still pushes the world forward. The reason, my own good reasons here that I am look at Walter Fisher work, is because it seems to help to explain the world we live in, the current networked world. 

Water points that the entrance door for one that hears, that listens, has less to do with logic and reason, and more to do with storytelling. That is not to imply that we love to use good stories to justify our actions with no regard to rationality, logic, or reasoning. But it is like an entrance door. As written in the foreword in his book, "Later we learn more sophisticated criteria and standards for assessing a story's fidelity and coherence, but constructing, interpreting, and evaluating discourse as "story" remains our primary, innate, species-specific 'logic.'" (p. xx) 

Now, before I move on, I have to tell you that I am here simply bringing a perspective to prompt us - founders t - to reflect. [Here I want to make the case that communication seems and it is logical in ways, that the long run might actually have mechanisms to test.] It seems logical to provoke how founders use communication with the lenses of the very question from the back of Fisher's book, "how do people come to believe and act on the basis of communicative experiences."  It seems to be a good question to make, especially now that we live in the days of the social networks, and where many authors such as Max Fisher, are writing books (such as The Chaos Machine) and saying outloud to us that we live in a world that too many people are propagating news without checking, and, as a consequence of that, too many people are indeed believing and acting on the basis of communicative experiences. 

So, even if I don't fully grasp what is going on with this work that suggest that we are more of a Homo narrans than sapiens, still, if the point of us here is to reflect about the urgencies of the world that pushes us to act in ways that can be bad for us, why not, at least to invite us to reflect. 

So, here we are, let's consider for the moment that we are, in a way, operating our days by listening to stories and doing a storytelling check first, then to think later. At this point, I also would like to point that if our brains has a means to "check the storytelling" first before an more deep analysis of what was said, this might also show a sort of same pattern like in a way what the acceleration systems of entrepreneurship does, as you can read in the chapter Accelerated Systems [check if it is before or after and check how to refer to that in good way for the reader I mean how top writers make reference to other articles in the same book, is it possible to refer as footnote or with a citation that cites the same book? ]

A quick review to how an accelerator might pick winners. Gives them a system to organize a bit what they were doing, or what they want to do, then apply a criteria that checks some "vital signs" of the situation. Such as 3 founders, such as prototype, and other aspects depending on the accelerator program. Then, if the team passes, other checks apply. Although it seems that this has nothing to do with storytelling, one thing we know, that if a team has the data, and a half prototype that shows signs of value, but can't tell the story, we know it it does not pass. We also know that subjective readings counts a lot, such as the grades that me mentors and judges do. If we consider that the system to judge has to be shows performance, and if consider that the find a good ratio, such as the winners end up yielding value in the long run, after investment even if one in 10 works, then perhaps the system of acceptance is good. Plus, it does not mean that they are not going to be critical later. Again, I am focusing on the passing factors, the entrance door, and making a point. That not only humans might be accepting a story first, giving attention first. But that the systems made by humans also shows that pattern. And it might be the case that this is the faster way to process things. And it makes sense, doesn't it? That we grasp what is being told with induction first, then we do the analysis, then we enter in detective mode. 

Thus, a first note here, before we enter the space of narratives and the reflection for entrepreneurs, is that if one wants to put a dent in the universe, or in a market, or a community, or even to convince her parents, one has to acknowledge that inductive communication comes first, and being good in storytelling. 

But the point of the article is, perhaps unfortunately, not to celebrate how we can do better via controlling storytelling, an important aspect for founders to learn. Silicon valley investor Michael Dearing recommends founders to read the book Story if Robert McKee, and also to improve their executive communication skills with The Pyramid Principle, the work of Barbara Minto. 

But anyway, here and now, in the context of reflection about narrations, and how founders use narrations to advance, I would like us to look at the beautiful side, the good side, and the complications, the bad side, that comes with this mechanism. The storytelling mechanism, that is present in the day by day of founders, is a magical thing. It is the thing that pulls them to do things, to get up in the morning, to mobilize others. And it is also the magical thing that pulls them to fail, to waste resources, to break companies. The real complication is that we can't control to only take the good parts of it. The price we pay, as founders, for using this tool that enable us to create things out of nothing, to project things before they exist, is that it project things that we will believe, especially in the very beginning, when a lot are ideas but efforts are being made, efforts to put out to the world 

Let's dive.

Let's us consider especially a powerful message, that Walter Fisher bought, "Narratives enable us to understand the actions of others 'because we all live out narratives in our lives and because we understand our own lives in terms of narratives. '" reference is p.83, After Virtue, Narratives of the Self, Studies in Social Identity. [We need to find a new way to deal with this citation as it is a citation that incorporates another citation. ]

This notion might suggest two themes for reflection. One is that our identity is maintained with narratives. So it could be a bit of an an absurd to think that who you are, or what you sense of what you are, is more like a story and even more strong, a story that you might have created, that you are editing it. 

But even if your general story of life isn't written as a story at a conscious level, explicit, we do have indications that people seem to adhere to their identity when they are engaged in works, like a job, or a project, or running a company. As indicated in "..." Andy Grove brought a reflection about the identities of executives that form as a result of a success, which creates for them complications to see with an external eye. He wrote, in Only the Paranoid Survive, p.x:

And before we move on here, consider for a while about our ability to anchor ourselves in certain places. How we might respond to engaging, or not engaging, with prompts in front of us, in many situations using an fast, or high performance, mechanism of judging ourselves.

I recall an episode where someone asked my mother for a visit. My mother instantly replied that she was very busy with her things, helping family and her sisters, and so on. Since I was in the position of an external eye, and also felt as in being in a position to be a critic of her, I said "mother, you do nothing." Of course, my observation to her didn't help her. Perhaps it even pushed her to believe that all that she was doing was even move important. At least more important than listening to that sort of comment. And it make sense, doesn't it? That we are in our bubbles. Like the situation that Andy Grove brought up was mainly a celebration that a lot of the people around you, especially when there is hierarchy, are echoing and maintaining the bubble. And plus, and we should not forget this, we are socializing too with the folks around us, colleagues too. Thus, a lot that goes on with people in work is commonly perceived a sort of identity too. We seem to know how to separate as in our lives from a work identity. But still, we also know how to maintain the work identity under a certain control, as we might know that we depend on it. Thus, it does not matter much if the a work identity really connects with the general identity of us. What matters, at least for thus reflection here about narratives, is that we do such as effort to keep that identity working, doing a good job. Again, because we might think that we depend on it. Such as when our future depends on it.

The secondary aspect, that narrative is how we make sense of things, deserves a bit of thought as well. Let's consider the process of entrepreneurship, such as when we start working in a new project, and how narrative driven progress influences us, again, to do good, and also to do bad.

## How successful stories make sense of stories 

Consider the dynamics of a start-up seeking investment. In their pursuit of the golden ticket, they might face rejection after rejection, before finally hitting the mark. The moment they secure funding becomes a photographic moment, shared and celebrated. But what about the numerous failed attempts that preceded this victory? The world only sees the tip of the iceberg - the success - but the failures and learnings that formed the bulk of the iceberg remain unseen.

This phenomenon isn't simply about the invisibility of failure; it's about the missing narrative of perseverance, trial and error, and the determination that brought about success. The world doesn't see the pre-lean phase, the struggles, the near misses. Yet, these form the bedrock of any entrepreneurial journey and hold invaluable lessons for those daring to walk the same path.

## The Lean Dilemma

Renowned entrepreneur Eric Ries in his book The Startup Way [^ericriesonfoundersnolean] discusses the lean startup methodology. But provoke founders pointing an intriguing trend that emerges when entrepreneurs often abandon the lean methodology once they find a promising lead. It's akin to an urgency mode kicking in, driving them to forego the principles that initially brought them close to success. This switch often leads to incomplete narratives, painting a picture of an effortless, straight-line journey towards achievement, while leaving out the meandering path of exploration that led to the discovery. This needs to be rectified, for the sake of completeness and responsibility towards upcoming entrepreneurs.

[^ericriesonfoundersnolean]:

So, we find ourselves at a crossroads. To better convey the journey of entrepreneurship, we need to slow down, reflect, and ensure we're grasping the complete stories. It's not just about success and failure; it's about the journey, the process, the learning. It's high time we told those stories in their full glory, complete with their many trials and errors. Only then will we truly honour the entrepreneurial journey and guide ourselves and out future generations responsibly.

[Author's Note: Please remember to revise and add references where necessary.]

What is intrinsic, in the art and science of entrepreneurship, is that the story told is a projection to start with, especially in the modern version of entrepreneurship promoted after the lean movements. It's a discovery, clearly all the lean methods recognize that. And in terms of reasons, or good reasons, for a founder to be in, as recognized by Steve Blank, it requires the state of founders to feel that they are "in a calling" [^steveblankreferred]. Therefore, we seem to be on a mission, to bring something to the world, and do us. Yes, indeed these processes have a core principle, to help founders to craft a solution for a current or future need of a given market, not exactly a demographic market as businesses used to define, but more like a needs market [^jobtobedonemarket]. 

[^steveblankreferred]: 

[^jobtobedonemarket]:

The discovery process [^customerdiscovery] tries to check if the founders can come up with a solution, which they don't know yet, for a need that they also don't know yet, in a way that value is perceived by them and their users users, and towards the situation where users are able and willing to buy. Therefore, processes like this are in place for the sake of testing for their capacity to execute such process. 

[^customerdiscovery]: 

Therefore, since nothing much is there in the first place, we can rest knowing that the process often start with narrative, a story of how founders start; which indeed might have roots in personal individual values, or it could be based on "good reasons" of the founders to join the calling. 

But since nothing is there, and that it does not make sense to have a strict business plan for what is next [^stevenobusinessplansurvives], founders have to satisfy themselves by understanding that what hold them together is a story. One that compells then to work, to try, to learn, and to execute, towards their goals. And as they do, as expectations and goals are set, they seek out models to supports them to manage themselves, as resources, so that hopefully they can bring a value proposition for a potential market. To explore this idea with colors, consider the popular notion of the minimum viable product, the MVP [^mvpprocess], which involves the idea of testing an idea, such as a prototype, in front of users to see if there is value. The idea could be a new kind of sandwich, or something prototyped in paper, or a software system. There are different ways to do an MVP but it's accepted the general notion that an MVP is not the early version of a product. The idea is that they can test and learn, not to increment it. The goal is to learn if users enjoy and see value. And then, depending on the results and other factors, the team makes a decision for doing something else, such as to advance towards another MVP that may test other hypothesis - all that to sort of improve the confidence level about the next phase of investment which should naturally involve more resources. The development of an MVP follows a narrative, a plan, althouht no MVP has the goal of being the product. It's a means for learning, mostly.  

[^stevenobusinessplansurvives]: 

[^mvpprocess]: 

Now, as indicated by the process, learning is involved so that the next phase of investment can be activated. Implicit in this process is the idea that someone is observing, the judges, being the team or others supporting peers. Any learning effort that goes on, with a plan of execution (good or bad) will only happen in a period of time and should arrive at a presentation in front of a hypothetical judge that will approve the next phase. The judges can be the founders approving themselves as resources to try again, do a new cycle, keep on going, you name it. 

Thereore, for the approaval phase to happen, a narrative has to exist. Such as short narratives that they tell themselves, analysis reports and other narratives that may fill the details for a presentation. This format invaribly involves founders advancing as they do analysis for a general narrative that attempts to add the supporting data related to their ideas, guesses or hypothesis, data and interpretation of their incomplete tests, interpretations of responses such as feedback from early users, and other partial analysis. 

Looking at founders as the ones carrying on narratives, they can be seen as protagonists of their entrepreneurial efforts and that they act to construct a narrative that presents good reasons for themselves, and others such as users and investors, to act, to trust. Looking using this perspective, I invite you to consider the idea that founders serve as great examples of the Homo narrans ("storytelling human") [^waterfisherhomonarrans], a metaphor for humans as beings that coordinates meaningful communication via storytelling and where where they participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. 

## The narrative paradigm 

Let's consider for a moment that what we do essentially has more to do with storytelling, as Homo narrans. A theory of Walter Fisher, known as the Narrative paradigm, claims that human communication occurs from our participation as storytellers or observers of narratives. The provoking point about the theory is that stories are more persuasive than arguments. Our capacity to grasp and retain ideas often hinges on storytelling, an intrinsic human trait. We learn, discern values, and act based on the narratives we encounter. Imagine someone who's never tried an orange. A persuasive story from a friend about their first delicious encounter might be the nudge needed to inspire a taste test.

By following this line of thinking, let's consider that we live out narratives and with that, that we understand, or measure, our lives, and consequently inclinations to do things, in terms of narratives that we evaluate. 

Now, by just focusing in storytelling, we are likely to understand that founders are not driven only based on that main aspect. We know that they have to be good storytellers, but also that what they try to create, in the end of the day, will need to pass a big test, the real test, in front of ultimately the ones that can accept or deny the product. The real judges, such as customers. We don't deny that the end has to bring value and has to be concrete. 

Still, our attention here, as we consider the process, is that a lot of support that founders get has to do with the judgements that they do themselves, and by the others that they are contacting on their way. In addition, that they need to be organized and coordinate actions by telling themselves stories of how they are doing, how they are executing. The complication for them is that the actual storytelling of the execution will naturally deal with data that is more or less accurate. In other words, the methods they use, in the early stages and through discovery, are lean methods that naturally don't guarantees success at the next stop. If we consider tools such as the MVP, business model canvas, or customer discovery; all of these are iterative solutions to help them to get data, or fragments of data, that are to be interpreted subjectively based on founders knowledge, and becomes information inserted in their stories to support the call, such as a yes or no, for the next stage of investment. 

But as we dive in the process, if we zoom in, we will see that storytelling is applied by the hour, as events are happening, as execution happens. To give colorful case, consider the "72h rule" created by Steve Blank to help teams to control the impulses of a CEO - that leaves the building to do interviews - that comes back with a story that seem to present good reasons to pivot. 

<!-- 

MAP14. (2014, March 13). MAP14 Public Forum: Steve Blank. [video]. Retrieved from https://youtu.be/UFx2CQUTpYo

--> 

The case presented by Steve shows how storytelling conveys partial data and compells the participants to act. It would be the case when the CEO presents its good reasons for a "let's pivot!" And as well, it is the case when the team stops that CEO with good reasons for "keeping your mouth shut, from when you think you got an insight do when you are allowed to announce the word pivot." (Steve Blank @ MAP14, 2014,  24m34s)

A CEO, when confronted with that strong saying, have a lot of reasons to trust the team too, as like a good classical story, the indicated rule might have being said in the right time and space and might pull a truth in it. Thus, the rule does not lie. It could be that it serves a purpose in the process but it may also influence the process. 

Thus, what is implicit in the doing of lean is a relationship with storytelling. We use storytelling to advance. But, of course, there is nothing wrong with that. But it serves as an alert of our propensity to decide for action x or y using stories. And a reminder for us that, when the clock is ticking, sticking with a story that supports decision is generally applauded. We need to be pragmatic, in the end of the day, we need to move. And, again, there is nothing wrong with that. As the process, as we know it, will ultimately reveal the truth, in the end of the days. 

As we delve into the process, consider how entrepreneurs might utilize storytelling not only to guide but also to feed their actions, akin to what communication theorists Frentz and Farrell term as episodes: "a rule-conforming sequence of symbolic acts generated by two or more actors who are collectively oriented towards emergent goals." 

Although this definition could be applicable to stories such as fiction stories, we can't deny that the definition of it does a good job that a lot of what founders do as they document their steps, their episodes. Consider that plus the undeniable, or implicit aspect, that they can't track what they do at all times by rewatching all the episodes that they have done. Therefore, as we advance projects, we are likely advancing a wider story with the episodes towards a general "climax" which guides a general outcome narrative, such as a final presentation which is presented in the context of the mission. 

And again, nothing wrong with that. But the complication is that as much as we like to have the truths, and facts, that tell us that we are in the right direction, still the process in itself is about experiencing, experimenting, learning, and creating new abstractions, conveyed in stories, intended to do the cycle again. We advance by summing support that will be presented as a short story to an audience, themselves or other partners in the process such as an investor. The next step, the judgment call, likely involves a supposedly external process of risk analysis. [^riskanalysisofvc]

[^riskanalysisofvc]: 

The supporting elements, to move on with new investments, becomes the stories we craft after our discoveries, and how others perceive our stories which may or may not involve data analysis, of course, as indicated by "risk analysis" the checking process is not totally done as data is incomplete. Another factor that the venture capital world confirms is that the early stage trust is tied with the reputation and credibility of founders. [^foundersreputation]. 

[^foundersreputation]: 

Consider how the community around founders is generally influential to help founders continue to move, or to try again, or continue to improve in the current line of development. The power dynamics is always present too and noticed when the CEO says something, when someone says that the data says something, that a mentor said something, the judges of an accelerator program, investors, potential customers, and so on. 

A case that is common is when an early customer is inclined to buy. This is quite powerful even when there is no product or what the customer wants is in fact not part of the goal. Many founders jump to getting that customer as it rings the bell that cash is coming in. That pulls effort for someone to try to put that into the story and can be quite powerful to promote a new direction if it fits as good reasons. 

But again, nothing too wrong that. But it serves to illustrate that revenue projection can also support telling a story for changing a direction, even to prompt founders into a conflicting decision, or to look for a new mission, but it is undeniable that a lot of these prompts in the early stage come from arbitrary interactions with arbitrary customers that had arbitrary needs. 

The complication is tied to the expectations, such as measurement expectations, which naturally pulls the team to make decisions as opposed to keep trying and exercising the lean cycle again and again. The story that they need to succeed with lean becomes in itself another storytelling that influences their actions. Consider the question that 
Rohan Workman asked to Steve Blank, if he has seen when founders claim that they are doing lean versus talking about lean. Steve Blank acknowledged that as a disorder that affects founders when they get enamored with the process. 

Consider how strong it can be the data "from the real world" for a group of founders that were in a prior condition where they never left the room where they kept idealizing too much in theory, as hypothesis. Wouldn't be the case that, perhaps, their act of going out and "get the data" to become fascinating and inspire them to consider the external event as real data or good reasons? And, again, there is nothing wrong with that, of course, as talking with someone, a real customer, can be fascinating in contrast with idealizing things in front of a digital screen. So important and interesting that the very fact of contrasting with the prior situation, poorer situation, becomes a good reason perhaps for a new decision. 

These illustrations are here to help us to execute these processes, the episodes of a lean process, with more tolerance to the results and awareness. Since awareness is key to any process, and founders generally suffer from being enamored with the process, it becomes the founder’s responsibility first to recognize such syndrome; then second, to find for ways to ensure the process is running with quality. But them, wait, what is quality right? Is quality related to control? Consider Scott Belsky’s view about faiure from Making Ideas Happen:

> “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity. Stay strong and stay calm as a situation settles itself over time and the clouds around any period of change start to dissipate. “ (Scott Belsky, 2010, Making Ideas Happen)

<!--

Belsky, Scott. (2010). Making Ideas Happen. London, England: Portfolio.

-->

This view perhaps support us towards the idea of the knowing that the process and our presence to tell stories, is likely affecting the whole proces. This notion, when embraced, can provoke founders to be in a more humble position which improves them into listening even more and to do the craft, such as to pull data and advance episodes, but to know that all their did had to do with their effort with limited data, as limited beings, influencing the story and the storytelling. As they say that, upfront, they keep a reminder to them, and to the audiences, and also open the door to get more data from external minds. The improvemet of quality derives from that listening condition and may improve when they engage with an advisory board as a body responsible for an outside perspective therefore supporting the founder to get out from instant pressures, and compromising decisions: 

> "That is why you need an advisory board, or board of directors, who is coaching the founders on this because you could get enamorated with the process and confused that the last person to blow on your ear, actually have a valid insight."  (Steve Blank @ MAP14, 2014, 24m51s)

Now the general indication of having an advisory board needs a reflection as it may make sense that there is an absurdity. That because a board of directors are, in general, known and applicable as necessary for large companies. Therefore, there is a general understanding that ignoring a board of directors is a good thing. 

But the reflection is key in establishing the idea of the "entity" of a board of directions, or the role of them. Consider the view For professor and investor Michael Dearing, for why founders need a governance approach: 

> "I need to make sure that somebody is looking at this who isn't just me. Who can critique the strategy it might be an advisor it might be a trusted colleague it might be a cofounder." Michael Dearing. (Greylock, 2015 October 8, 1:00:00) 

Now, we need to be sensible that an early team might not even be able to find a good external eyes to help them there. But the early founders should keep in mind that they need to construct their own system of support to save them from their bad narratives. Michal goes on to indicate that the key point is to seek to create a valuable function of a shock absorber that does the function of checking the progress of founders.

The founder engaging in the devil’s advocacy business
“[Reid Hoffman asks] And what are the indicators that you would use for checking the idea. [context: You could be jumping off a clicf without the ability to assemble the airplane on your way down]. What are the crosschecks you think people should do?

> "[Michael Dearing] One really good one is to give a chunk of time in the schedule to devil’s advocacy. And this was a tactic that I learned from Michael Eisner at Disney. I didn’t work for him but I worked for somebody who worked for him and the whole idea there was — every big good idea is going to be subjected to a devil’s advocate case. And somebody, probably the smartest person he could find, is going to be in charge of trying to destroy your idea. And he or she isn’t gonna be held as, like, they’re not going to be considered to be out of bounds for trying to destroy your idea it was their job to try to destroy your idea. And that technique of saying — okay, you please spend the next two days finding everything wrong with this, and then you have full permission to be the biggest asshole you ever met, trying to torpedo this idea. If you can find some people in your life who can play that role, that’s a huge positive as a founder. (Michael Dearing @ Greylock, 2015, 33min18sec)

Chat gpt on cognitive behavior vs. narrative 

The narrative paradigm has been used in business research to analyze the narratives or stories told by CEOs and other business leaders. These narratives often shape the culture, identity, and strategy of a business. A few relevant sources are:

"Narrative and the Practice of Strategy" (Vaara et al., 2016)
"Building Theories of Organization: The Constitutive Role of Communication" (Putnam et al., 2009)
"The Role of Narratives in Sustaining Organizational Innovation" (Sonenshein, 2010)
These studies, among others, examine how narratives or storytelling are used by leaders to engage employees, enact strategies, and influence organizational culture and innovation.

Regarding cognitive distortions, it's reasonable to surmise that these would influence a leader's storytelling. Cognitive distortions, which are irrational or exaggerated thought patterns, can affect how one perceives and interprets information, including one's own experiences and the behavior of others. This could certainly affect the kinds of narratives a leader constructs and shares. However, as of my last update in 2021, I do not have specific research on the connection between cognitive distortions and storytelling in leadership.

It's a fascinating area for further exploration and it may be that there has been more recent research on this topic. Keep in mind that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques are often used to address cognitive distortions, and these techniques can include narrative components, which further highlights the potential connection between these areas.
