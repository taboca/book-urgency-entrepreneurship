<!-- Provocation --> 

Our focus in this section is an oppoortunity to look at how we, as entrepreneurs, come to believe and act on the basis of the stories that we read and the ones we write, as we move on. 

In a more traditional way of thinking, there is an idea that storytelling is a tool, that can be used to our advantage, such as when a founder gives a pitch to an investor with the intent of receiving an investment. Or, from the perspective of acquiring feedback, when a team seeks advice from a board member. Therefore, mainly as a tool where the stories listened, or the ones said, are working for the strategy, to move on, to advance. In this way of thinking, we have good reasons to believe that stories are crafted with rationality and serves strategy. That we are in control. 

But our line of inquiry involves the consideration that we can be less conscious about we use storytelling. In other words, we are interested in checking when storytelling eats strategy for breakfast[^footnote_andygrove_peterdrucker]. We will attempt to isolate what can't be isolated - to look at how we as entrepreneurs depend on storytelling. Or, to consider a provocation on our way: If entrepreneurs are storytellers, are they able to control, or differentiate, when they are using, or being used by, storytelling?

[^footnote_andygrove_peterdrucker]: Andy Grove quoted Peter Drucker's famous quote that "culture eats strategy for breakfast" in the book High Output Management. 

In the book *It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work* (2018), Jason and David, calls our attention to a language that the business world is obsessed with. They call our attention to action-oriented situations that visceraly invite us, to act. These can be questions such as "Let's double the market?", "Who is getting which awards?", "Who is raising money?", and so on. For them, it is a "language of war" that fills out the skies of the entrepreneurial landscape. Or more likely, it clouds. 

> "Sadly, it's not easy to escape the business tropes of war and conquest. Every media outlet has a template for describing rival companies as warring factions. Sex sells, wars sell, and business battles serve as financial-page porn. " (2018, P.21)

Is it that the storytelling of what really goes on is too boring and does not sell? In part, indeed, it makes sense that there is a lot of successful stories that has that selling thing so that it doesn't not have room for failure, or for a boring language of work. And indeed, it might be a "language of war" not in the sense that we are excited with visceral things but because the storytelling in the language of war generally comes with a narrative of action, a language that is oriented to outcomes, a language that projects what we can get, such as what we would get after the fight. 

As we dig towards giving us more responsibility for dealing with storytelling, I invite us consider that we, as entrepreneurs, are the ones engaging with the reasonability of stories on our way, in the first place. We are the ones listening, and acting, on the things we buy-in, giving our likes, and echoying to ourselves and the ones around us. The complication in the domain of founders is not much different from the world of mortals in the trenches of social networks, as one in a syloed socia network enjoys the narratives of the group that they identify with, in many situatios echoying stories as they decide to act. [This paragraph attempts to illustrate that Chaos Machine supports that we network in the social, and spread words, such as fakenews. Is there any related mechanism that affects entrepreneurs on their domain? Are they subject to echoying to themselves?]

Therefore, the complication, is that we fall for a paradigm where we seek out for good reasons in the face of what is next, a decision that has to be made. In other words, we are seeking to buy-in something so that we can act. And outcomes, such as "winning the market," become good reasons. Or better, these things (action oriented ideas) become accepted in the face of good reasons, not out of the sudden but in the face of the context. 

Do the test, invite a friend to cook a dinner for you, such as one that goes to the oven. As the process happens, tell him to "win the market!" and wait for an akward face or just a  sip of wine to happen. But when "win the market" is said in the context of baking a start-up, then it has more to do with good reasons to act as opposed to taking a sip of wine which could save them from trouble of a drive that pushes them towards actions that won't at all help with win any market.

But as Jason and David wrote, that is "a paradigm which does not make sense." Especially for entrepreneurs, as they should keep a focus for what matters, as they have limited resources, as they need to be strategic about how they use their limited resources towards what matters. This paradigm, (for us to come to believe and act), affects us for why we do, what we do, and how we do. Consider when Steve Blank reminded founders of their inclinatation to being a founder with the goal of chasing a prize such as money: 

> "You need to do what you are doing because you love it, because you can’t think of anything better to do with your life. And if that is not the case, don’t do this because it’s going to be a miserable 10 or 20 years. If you are looking at getting rich like the Facebook boys, or the Google boys, or whatever the hot startup is now, that is the wrong reason to do it. If you are chasing the money, I will guarantee you, the more you chase it, the further away is goes." (Steve Blank at MAP14, Mar 13, 2014, 34m33s)

It is reasonsable to consider, even when a team is in it for a special cause beyond money, the question of when and how financial outcomes - or related outcomes indirectly linkedin to financial - are projected in the narrative of a start-up. It is part of the reasons for a start-up to exist, isn't it? In other words, to exist, to be in the market, to survive, to sustain itself. Thus, it is also important not only to ask if we are in it for the money as a big call. But when good reasons for winning - winning as we know - comes our way and affects the routine. These outccome-based reasons are there, we know, and we don't even worry about it. Which is a reason, again for this article. We tend to move too fast in many situations, in the face of fragmented data and stories we listen, we model the storytelling, we convince ourselves. 

As we dig for the "how we do it" - the things we do in the daily basis - as teams execute and learn simultaneously, our tendency to use this paradigm for "chasing prizes", or orient ourselves to outcomes, might have a lot to do with the way we communicate and reason, and less with our obsession for money, market, or prizes. Now I then invite us to consider the narrative paradigm which can support us to think that founders are more of Homo narrans than sapiens. We will start with learnings from Walter Fisher, known for extensive research in terms of how we, as human beings, come to believe and act on the basis of storytelling. [Check this statment if it is the best for a short introduction.]

## The narrative paradigm 

<!-- as a transactional mechanism applicable to urgency 

* Situation, transactional communication helps with speed. 
* Situation, assume rational-world as the frame. 
* Complication, we fail. We blame rationality or logic. We never check on storytelling. 
* qA, let's understand how we believe and act. 

* Key point a - How our trust for all, such as communication storytelling, as a result of reason, make us blind to communication storytelling, thinking it's a mere tool that sometimes fails, communication problem. Our framework starts with being scientific, affects us. OUr thinking that communication follows from rational thinking, effect us. Provoking is urgent. 

* Key point b - We as storytellers, and the basic mecanism of advancing with storytelling, applies perfect to urgent and decision-oriented processes. The reccounting and accounting nature of everyday argument is present. 

* Key point c - Good reasons are used well. 

* Conclusion, we model, all the time, in the fact of an outcome that is being pursured, we conform with a track. We find good reasons for the mode of communication that pushes us forward, with reccounting and accounting. p.62. 

--> 

Looking at founders as the ones carrying on narratives, they can be seen as protagonists of their entrepreneurial goals. They are generally in control of the stories they listen. And in control of of writing their stories. With that, they use communication as a tool, such as when they use it to convince them themselves, and others such as users and investors, to trust, and to act. 

That view aligns with a paradigm familiar, especially in the west. It is the rational-world paradigm which helps us to see that in the end of the day, communication is available to serve the needs of humans as rational beings, where decision-making and communication is argumentative. Or, with the words of Walter, where "argument as product and process is the means of being human." (p.60)

But then, as entrepreneurship happens, trouble comes our way. We find that we run into problems after we follow some outcomes such as "win the market." [Consider indirect or other examples not at the goal top level.] We go back to revising the things we are doing, but with the assumption that we rere following a rational plan in the first place. The conclusion, we arrive at considering the strategy. Which makes sense, apparently. Or to consider that as we were moving on, we didn't have a full strategy or roadmap in the first place. 

So it does not matter what fail comes from our doing, we again and again, think that the only available solution is to think about that rationality, or the rational plan, as the only thing to be judged. Such as we arrive at an "oh, we did't have a good strategy or our strategy were poor." We don't see that even such a sentence can be too powerful and meaningful and give us good resons, such as good reasons to go back to strategy. As opposed to focus on how we are victims of a powerful storytelling mechanism. 

Let's look at considerations and we having anchored ourselves in the rational-world paradigm, and learn the basic components of the narrative paradigm. Let's consider, point B, the great and risky feature in us in the face of urgency, as we demand action-orientation. The aspects of the narrative paradigm and how it fits with the entrepreneurhip action-oriented model. And the approach of based on good reasons that we use in our stories. 

## Urgent - Awareness of how we are storytellers and how we anchor ourselves in what we think as rationality 

We rarely consider is that we where evolve decisions based on a storytelling mode of communication that actively serves the everyday argument and conveys good reasons to support whatever we are doing. The contrasting view presented by Walter - the narrative paradigm - help us to understand a problem when rationality fails to be present in the everyday argument. Walter sheds a light, and give us a reflective moment, for us to realize that our very assumptions about communication, and that storytelling is more of a tool serving rationallity, preven us to seeing that our communication approach has less to do with that can trap our ways. 

The narrative paradigm will provoke us to see ourselves more like the Homo narrans ("storytelling human") [^walterfisherhomonarrans], a metaphor for humans as beings that coordinates meaningful communication via storytelling and where where they participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. Consider a question in the cover of Walter Fisher's book [is it possible to fix this reference as I indicated a reference to the cover?] entitled Human Communication as Narration, which posits a question "How do people come to believe and to act on the basis of communicative experiences?" 

The reason, my own good reasons here that I am thankful for the work of Walter Fisher, is because it seems to help to explain the how entrepreneurs engage in quick decisions from storytelling, as in what many refer to them as using their instincts, and failing to later blame their plans, and never considering communication they use. 

* Paul Graham on instincts
* Steve Blank on instincts 

Especially at this stage, as all is interconnectdd, as we operate entrepreneurship in the networked world, entrepreneurship suffers even more with storytelling-based communication that is action-oriented and take them to waste resources and become frustrated but never frustrated about how they communicate. 

Walter points that the entrance door for one that hears, that listens, has less to do with logic and reason, and more to do with storytelling. That is not to imply that we love to use good stories to justify our actions with no regard to rationality, logic, or reasoning. But it is like an entrance door. As written in the foreword in his book, "Later we learn more sophisticated criteria and standards for assessing a story's fidelity and coherence, but constructing, interpreting, and evaluating discourse as "story" remains our primary, innate, species-specific 'logic.'" (p. xx) 

> "I believe that the narrative paradigm may offer a better solution, [In contrast with the rational-world paradigm] One that will provide substance not only for public moral argument, but also all other forms of argument, for human communication in general. " (p. 62)

* "With minor adaptation, I find no imcompatibility between the narrative paradigm and the language-action paradigm. " (p.64)

* Pressupositions of the narrative paradigm. P.64 

* "Humans are essentially storytellers. "
* "The paradigmatic mode of human decision making and communication is 'good reasons,' which vary in form amoung situations, genres, and media of communication. " p.64 
* 3... complex
* "Rationality is determined by the nature of persons as narrative beings - their inherent awareness of *narrative probability*, what constitutes a coherent story, and their constant habit of testing *narrative fidelity*, whether or not the stories they experience ring true with the stories they know to be true in their lives.

### The elements of good reasons




## Back to outcome-based storytelling 

<!--

Outcome-based works as good reasons. Anchors at various levels. 

--> 


In this direction, starting with the obvious, we need to acknowledge that focusing on outcomes is a great feature of humans. It's on our alpha nature that we first target a salmon after having good reasons. And we found our ways to capture and bring back to our homes in a stick. Therefore, having an outcome in sight is a requirement that help us find our way to get solve the problem. 

After stating an outcome, which is a language that pulls us towards the action of capturing the outcome, it comes the question of how to achieve. For that we use comparisons. In the "language of war", one could be after something that the other has it, such as the marketshare of a competitor. Comparison is in us to help us decide with less analysis, quickly. According to Michael Dearing, "these are things you have instinctively in you as a human being, who makes discriminating choices between one thing and another thing that might be better." (Dearing, M. (2013, July 16))

We know that, when we wear shopping hats, when we pick the cheaper or the better. And we also know the cost of being stuck in analysis such as when we are in a hurry. 

> "Lots of companies are driven by comparisons in general. Not just wether they're first, second or third in their industry, but how they stack up feature for feature with their closest competitors. " David and Jason, (2018, P.22)

Connecting the dots, we can conclude that for the situations that we have things to compare, we can do a reasonably good job, of comparing. We do that quite fast as opposed to doing analysis which takes time. But the complication, especially for founders, is that we have lots of things to shop - be that advice, methods, systems, principles, you name it - as we seek out activities that advance the roadmap of our startups. [Consider this one following to bring that connection of action with possible expecting outcomes, such as ones in a hierarchy, can support decisions and listening. L1: for the money, l2: win the market, l3: features. And the things inthe middle, methods. ] 

In the supermarket of entrepreneurship - and now these are mega supermarkets that are connected - we have too many products, or solutions, properly available in various aisles. When we go out, we find soutions that comes with labels such as "This is good if you want to dominate the market", among others. But there are too many aisles for all the sorts of needs. Things we can learn, things to help implement features, things sold as methodologies, advices, and so on. 

The analogy of the supermarket does justice to the complication not because founders necessary go out to do a shopping seeking for solutions of-the-shelf as in pre-planned, as in to get tools and resources, at once, for a big recipe to happen such as a business plan where a team would deal with arrangement of things make sense later. But because in the modern and iterative approach for entrepreneurs, we are visiting the asiles of this 24x7 supermarket all the time, listening to solutions from others the the ones we have created too, with storytelling present when we deal with all of these things. The complication for founders is not unlike the condition of a hungry customer that happens to be in the supermarket in a hurry, that happens to be in a place and a give time with a latent need. THe visit of as aisle is already an anchor we create and give us good reasons. After that, we compare and decide quick. Not unlike the shopper situation, our first reaction in the process of evaluation is to check the storytelling, if it has certain attributes, such as if it is valid, if it makes sense. Depending of what we get, it might provoke us to decide such as comparisons as opposed to all the time engaging in a complex analysis process. What puts in even in a more complicated place is that what used to be a long and complex process, such as a business plan, is now a long list of small processes, and all of them bring their own storytelling and very good reasons to be used. It is not diffult, for new entrepreurs, to jump to make a startup and come out from the supermarket of entrepreneurship with a lot of "solutions" in the cart, a lot of ideas, a lot of advices, methods, you name it. But it is also not difficult for this shopper to find later that the recipe didn't work as expected. 

A pause for a reflective moment about our decisions when we are pressured, such as hungry. I went to have lunch with my companion. The place is what we have in Brazil that is called live pasta - the cook, behind a glass, holds a hot pan and there are many ingredients so you can make your own pasta. I was the next so I had the chance to see her ordering first. It is important to note that I have Italian origins so a bit of a tendency to pick something more plain. If I was to order my pasta, and pick ingredients out of the 24 compartments, I would probably make a script such as: pasta, olive oil, olive oil, olive oil, garlic, garlic, garlic, manjerona, majerona, salt, salt, and bacon, bacon, and bacon. But I am guessing that she didn't have a recipe she was craving and out of the sudden the cook used the spoon to point to the first box and said butter? And was in front of a yes or not and said yes. Then bacon? She said yes. And after a while I could only hear her yes or no depending on what he was prompting. She end up with a brownisn colored plate with many things in it except the things she didn't like. So in a way, it seemed to be a false-positive. It passed, moved well, within the zoomed in narratives, but it wouldn't pass the italian test. 

Going back to entrepreneurs, and seeking a colorful example, consider the very situation when founders need to make a decision in front of a situation and findthemselves doing quick decisions based on the storytelling as opposed to a full analysis. Many entrepreneurs might simply gravitate towards deciding the quick route after the fact that they associate analysis with analysis paralysis [^analysisparalysis]. For the ones that read and taken a lesson about that notion, or story, consider the fear that they have as they might have heard of read about that and the risks of doing analysis. In other words, what if we once time heard about the condition of analysis paralysis as that advice were told in the right time and right moment and right context.

## The Lean Dilemma

<!-- 

And Reasons to drop lean 

--> 


The situation is that we will learn, we iterate. Lean is for that. But we also give up on that as soon as we stumble in what appears to be evidence. 

Renowned entrepreneur Eric Ries in his book The Startup Way [^ericriesonfoundersnolean] discusses a complication that comes in the way of founders as they advance with the lean startup methodology. He provoke founders pointing an intriguing trend that emerges when entrepreneurs often abandon the lean methodology once they find a promising lead. It's akin to an urgency mode kicking in, driving them to forego the principles that initially brought them to iterate and to learn. 

[^ericriesonfoundersnolean]:

Therefore, even if they enter "safe zones" of lean, and learn, Eric's point suggests that startups fall that instinctive tendency. In other words, we find "good reasons" to switch modes. As an example, these good reasons can be found in the aisle of growth which brings a lot of solutions and good reasons for a founder to buy-in and act. Natural questions when walking this aisle are: At some point we gotta scale? Once we get product-market fit, and so on. 

What is intrinsic, in the art and science of entrepreneurship, is that the story we tell ourselves is also part in influencing the "good reasons" for the next steps.  Since nothing much there in the first place, we can rest knowing that the process often start with narrative, a story of how founders start, which indeed might have roots in personal individual values, or it could be based on "good reasons" of the founders to join a calling [^steveblankcalling]. 

But since nothing is there, and that it does not make sense to have a strict business plan for what is next [^stevenobusinessplansurvives], founders have to satisfy themselves by understanding that what hold them together is a story. One that compells then to work, to try, to learn, and to execute, towards their goals. And as they do, as expectations and goals are set, they seek out models to supports them to manage themselves, as resources, so that hopefully they can bring a value proposition for a potential market. 

[^stevenobusinessplansurvives]: 

Now, as indicated by the process, learning is involved so that the next phase of investment can be activated - either more funding, more resources, scaling needs, productization, and more. Implicit in this process is the idea that someone is observing, the judges, being the team or others supporting peers. Any learning effort that goes on, with a plan of execution (good or bad) will only happen in a period of time and should arrive at a presentation in front of a hypothetical judge that will approve the next phase. The judges can be the founders approving themselves as resources to try again, do a new cycle, keep on going, you name it. 

Therefore, for the approaval phase to happen, a narrative has to exist. This need creates an anchor to founders. Influencing the narratives that they tell themselves, analysis reports and other narratives that may fill the details for a presentation. This format invaribly involves founders advancing as they do analysis for a general narrative that attempts to add the supporting data related to their ideas, guesses or hypothesis, data and interpretation of their incomplete tests, interpretations of responses such as feedback from early users, and other partial analysis. 

## [Seems to be talking about lean yet]

(Take this away from this if we want to keep as lean )

Let's consider for a moment that what we do essentially has more to do with storytelling, as Homo narrans. A theory of Walter Fisher, known as the Narrative paradigm, claims that human communication occurs from our participation as storytellers or observers of narratives. The provoking point about the theory is that stories are more persuasive than arguments. Our capacity to grasp and retain ideas often hinges on storytelling, an intrinsic human trait. We learn, discern values, and act based on the narratives we encounter. 

By following this line of thinking, let's consider that we live out narratives and with that, that we understand, or measure, our lives, and consequently inclinations to do things, in terms of narratives that we evaluate. 

Now, by just focusing in storytelling, we are likely to understand that founders are not driven only based on that main aspect. We know that they have to be good storytellers, but also that what they try to create, in the end of the day, will need to pass a big test, the real test, in front of ultimately the ones that can accept or deny the product. The real judges, such as customers. We don't deny that the end has to bring value and has to be concrete. 

Still, our attention here, as we consider the process, is that a lot of support that founders get has to do with the judgements that they do themselves, and by the others that they are contacting on their way. In addition, that they need to be organized and coordinate actions by telling themselves stories of how they are doing, how they are executing. The complication for them is that the actual storytelling of the execution will naturally deal with data that is more or less accurate. In other words, the methods they use, in the early stages and through discovery, are lean methods that naturally don't guarantees success at the next stop. If we consider tools such as the MVP, business model canvas, or customer discovery; all of these are iterative solutions to help them to get data, or fragments of data, that are to be interpreted subjectively based on founders knowledge, and becomes information inserted in their stories to support the call, such as a yes or no, for the next stage of investment. 

But as we dive in the process, if we zoom in, we will see that storytelling is applied by the hour, as events are happening, as execution happens. To give colorful case, consider the "72h rule" created by Steve Blank to help teams to control the impulses of a CEO - that leaves the building to do interviews - that comes back with a story that seem to present good reasons to pivot. 

<!-- 

MAP14. (2014, March 13). MAP14 Public Forum: Steve Blank. [video]. Retrieved from https://youtu.be/UFx2CQUTpYo

--> 

The case presented by Steve shows how storytelling conveys partial data and compells the participants to act. It would be the case when the CEO presents its good reasons for a "let's pivot!" And as well, it is the case when the team stops that CEO with good reasons for "keeping your mouth shut, from when you think you got an insight do when you are allowed to announce the word pivot." (Steve Blank @ MAP14, 2014,  24m34s)

A CEO, when confronted with that strong saying, have a lot of reasons to trust the team too, as like a good classical story, the indicated rule might have being said in the right time and space and might pull a truth in it. Thus, the rule does not lie. It could be that it serves a purpose in the process but it may also influence the process. 

Thus, what is implicit in the doing of lean is a relationship with storytelling. We use storytelling to advance. At the macro level, such as when we seek higher outcomes - financial rewards - or at the micro level, in the daily routine, as we are oriented to outcomes that seem to be aligned with the further outcomes.  But, of course, there is nothing wrong with that. 

But it serves as an alert of our propensity to decide for action x or y using stories. And a reminder for us that, when the clock is ticking, sticking with a story that supports decision is generally applauded. We need to be pragmatic, in the end of the day, we need to move. And, again, there is nothing wrong with that. As the process, as we know it, will ultimately reveal the truth, in the end of the days. 

## More case of lean?

But again, nothing too wrong that. But it serves to illustrate that revenue projection can also support telling a story for changing a direction, even to prompt founders into a conflicting decision, or to look for a new mission, but it is undeniable that a lot of these prompts in the early stage come from arbitrary interactions with arbitrary customers that had arbitrary needs. 

The complication is tied to the expectations, such as measurement expectations, which naturally pulls the team to make decisions as opposed to keep trying and exercising the lean cycle again and again. The story that they need to succeed with lean becomes in itself another storytelling that influences their actions. Consider the question that 
Rohan Workman asked to Steve Blank, if he has seen when founders claim that they are doing lean versus talking about lean. Steve Blank acknowledged that as a disorder that affects founders when they get enamored with the process. 

Consider how strong it can be the data "from the real world" for a group of founders that were in a prior condition where they never left the room where they kept idealizing too much in theory, as hypothesis. Wouldn't be the case that, perhaps, their act of going out and "get the data" to become fascinating and inspire them to consider the external event as real data or good reasons? And, again, there is nothing wrong with that, of course, as talking with someone, a real customer, can be fascinating in contrast with idealizing things in front of a digital screen. So important and interesting that the very fact of contrasting with the prior situation, poorer situation, becomes a good reason perhaps for a new decision. 

## Moving on with storytelling 

<!--

SCqA balance: Considering perspective storytelling too, breaking storytelling with shock-absorbers. 

-->

The challenge for founders lies in the knowing that truths are wanted, such as facts, that tell them about if they are in the right direction. Still, as we have seen, the process for advancing entrepreneurship uses storytelling as the most basic transactional mechanism - a mechanism of collaboration - that conveys meaning in the fact of the needs of the present and future. 

One way to help with the checking the sanity of storytelling is to test it against different viewpoints. Of course, a question remains as what is the viewpoint that matters. And this is a strategic conversation, or collaboration, that happens as stories are developed. 

The presence of venture capital in the path of a start-up offers an exercise for us to understand how analysis in perspective can provide opportunities. If a start-up is in a path to get investment, such as venture capital, it is likely assumed, on the one hand, that the start-up team is aware of the dynamics of that path, that might have a resonable knowledge of the type of partners that align with the start-up vision and mission. [Hard to assume that, right?] With that established, on the other hand, the dynamics with the venture partner likely involves a step ahead where judgment calls are made, likely involving a risk analysis. [^riskanalysisofvc]

[^riskanalysisofvc]: 

The supporting elements, to move on with new investments, becomes the stories we craft after our discoveries, and how others perceive our stories which may or may not involve data analysis, of course, as indicated by "risk analysis" the checking process is not totally done as data is incomplete. Even if the team works to adapt, or pass a criteria, the team does not know the criteria for initially passing and the qualitative reviews involved. [Other chapter refers to not game the system, as wasting time for selection. And other chapters we reflected about quantitative and qualitative later. ] This, it is reasonable to consider that the venture capital barrier has a viewpoint that founders might not have. An example, is that VC firm Sequoia Capital were in the seeking for what would disrupt cabs, such as yellow cabs. They also had insights about the challenges for that disruption to happen, such as that facing the fight with yellow cabs would be dfifficult. According to [Brad Scale up] Sequoia had an interaction with a good candidate that has refused to get out from the yellow cab situation, in the sense of being strategic to work with black cabs first. Uber end up receiving the support later. [Bring the data of that. ] In that story, it is sort of noted that one would not say no to a VC like Sequoia. But, on the other hand, the no meant that wxpectations for scaling with certain VC traits, like strategics, had more conformity with Sequoia-Uber relationship.  

To point another example of dynamics, consider how VCs look at founder reputation for the situations where VC does not have indications yet, or have provided limited data on potential, which is a lot of trhe case. In other words, venture capital "pipeline" confirms is that the early stage trust is tied with the reputation and credibility of founders. [^foundersreputation]. 

[^foundersreputation]: 

Consider how the community around founders is generally influential to help founders continue to move, or to try again, or continue to improve in the current line of development. The power dynamics is always present too and noticed when the CEO says something, when someone says that the data says something, that a mentor said something, the judges of an accelerator program, investors, potential customers, and so on. 

A case that is common is when an early customer is inclined to buy. This is quite powerful even when there is no product or what the customer wants is in fact not part of the goal. Many founders jump to getting that customer as it rings the bell that cash is coming in. That pulls effort for someone to try to put that into the story and can be quite powerful to promote a new direction if it fits as good reasons. 

From an accelerator perspective, conside the data that Brian Confirmed where the founders having done the cereal box project have influenced in part the approval for Y Combinator. [Bring data on that.]

These illustrations are here to help us to execute these processes, the episodes of a lean process, with more tolerance to the results and awareness. Since awareness is key to any process, and founders generally suffer from being enamored with the process, it becomes the founder’s responsibility first to recognize such syndrome; then second, to find for ways to ensure the process is running with quality. But them, wait, what is quality right? Is quality related to control? Consider Scott Belsky’s view about faiure from Making Ideas Happen:

> “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity. Stay strong and stay calm as a situation settles itself over time and the clouds around any period of change start to dissipate. “ (Scott Belsky, 2010, Making Ideas Happen)

This view perhaps support us towards the idea of the knowing that the process and our presence to tell stories, is likely affecting the whole proces. This notion, when embraced, can provoke founders to be in a more humble position which improves them into listening even more and to do the craft, such as to pull data and advance episodes, but to know that all their did had to do with their effort with limited data, as limited beings, influencing the story and the storytelling. As they say that, upfront, they keep a reminder to them, and to the audiences, and also open the door to get more data from external minds. The improvemet of quality derives from that listening condition and may improve when they engage with an advisory board as a body responsible for an outside perspective therefore supporting the founder to get out from instant pressures, and compromising decisions: 

> "That is why you need an advisory board, or board of directors, who is coaching the founders on this because you could get enamorated with the process and confused that the last person to blow on your ear, actually have a valid insight."  (Steve Blank @ MAP14, 2014, 24m51s)

Now the general indication of having an advisory board needs a reflection as it may make sense that there is an absurdity. That because a board of directors are, in general, known and applicable as necessary for large companies. Therefore, there is a general understanding that ignoring a board of directors is a good thing. 

But the reflection is key in establishing the idea of the "entity" of a board of directions, or the role of them. Consider the view For professor and investor Michael Dearing, for why founders need a governance approach: 

> "I need to make sure that somebody is looking at this who isn't just me. Who can critique the strategy it might be an advisor it might be a trusted colleague it might be a cofounder." Michael Dearing. (Greylock, 2015 October 8, 1:00:00) 

Now, we need to be sensible that an early team might not even be able to find a good external eyes to help them there. But the early founders should keep in mind that they need to construct their own system of support to save them from their bad narratives. Michal goes on to indicate that the key point is to seek to create a valuable function of a shock absorber that does the function of checking the progress of founders.

## Curating the devil's advocate, it's okay to destroy 

The founder engaging in the devil’s advocacy business
“[Reid Hoffman asks] And what are the indicators that you would use for checking the idea. [context: You could be jumping off a clicf without the ability to assemble the airplane on your way down]. What are the crosschecks you think people should do?

> "[Michael Dearing] One really good one is to give a chunk of time in the schedule to devil’s advocacy. And this was a tactic that I learned from Michael Eisner at Disney. I didn’t work for him but I worked for somebody who worked for him and the whole idea there was — every big good idea is going to be subjected to a devil’s advocate case. And somebody, probably the smartest person he could find, is going to be in charge of trying to destroy your idea. And he or she isn’t gonna be held as, like, they’re not going to be considered to be out of bounds for trying to destroy your idea it was their job to try to destroy your idea. And that technique of saying — okay, you please spend the next two days finding everything wrong with this, and then you have full permission to be the biggest asshole you ever met, trying to torpedo this idea. If you can find some people in your life who can play that role, that’s a huge positive as a founder. (Michael Dearing @ Greylock, 2015, 33min18sec)

Chat gpt on cognitive behavior vs. narrative 

The narrative paradigm has been used in business research to analyze the narratives or stories told by CEOs and other business leaders. These narratives often shape the culture, identity, and strategy of a business. A few relevant sources are:

"Narrative and the Practice of Strategy" (Vaara et al., 2016)
"Building Theories of Organization: The Constitutive Role of Communication" (Putnam et al., 2009)
"The Role of Narratives in Sustaining Organizational Innovation" (Sonenshein, 2010)
These studies, among others, examine how narratives or storytelling are used by leaders to engage employees, enact strategies, and influence organizational culture and innovation.

Regarding cognitive distortions, it's reasonable to surmise that these would influence a leader's storytelling. Cognitive distortions, which are irrational or exaggerated thought patterns, can affect how one perceives and interprets information, including one's own experiences and the behavior of others. This could certainly affect the kinds of narratives a leader constructs and shares. However, as of my last update in 2021, I do not have specific research on the connection between cognitive distortions and storytelling in leadership.

It's a fascinating area for further exploration and it may be that there has been more recent research on this topic. Keep in mind that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques are often used to address cognitive distortions, and these techniques can include narrative components, which further highlights the potential connection between these areas.
