In the entrepreneurial journey, the pressure for growth and rapid expansion is constant. Additionally, the desire for validation and social acceptance often leads entrepreneurs to invest in social media interactions as a way to advance – which is good. However, this immersion can be a double-edged sword: while it offers instant feedback and visibility, it is also a fertile ground for self-validation based on superficial feedback that does not represent validation for the future of the business.

How can we understand this dynamic and help entrepreneurs avoid these pitfalls? To address this issue, it is important to reflect on the factors that contribute to this problematic situation, starting with how social media communications are used as mechanisms to regulate the entrepreneur's self-esteem, leading to a mirage of progress. In the course of these reflections, consider the importance of not cheating the validation system and understanding how validation systems are also flawed.

#### The Pursuit of Positive Feedback on Social Media

Digital platforms, especially social media, have become a potential ground for quick feedback and popularity. Entrepreneurs, driven by the potential volume of interactions, may confuse social approval with progress, propelling them into a cycle of self-validation instead of genuine growth.

This phenomenon can be explained through Mark Leary's 'Sociometer' theory, as contextualized by Max Fisher in his book "The Chaos Machine: How Social Media Reprogrammed Our Minds and Our World" (2023). According to the author, Facebook made a significant leap in engagement after launching the Like button. Certainly, as users, we know the positive side of the Like button, which allows us to instantly connect with friends, support a poem, a celebration, or a theme that someone in your network launched. But Facebook's great discovery is that for the person posting, the Like button and the like counter function as a sociometer: a mechanism that feeds our self-esteem. In this sense, Fisher brings Leary's definition of self-esteem as a "psychological measure of the degree to which people perceive that they are valued in relationships and socially accepted by others" (Fisher, 2023, p. 44).

Logically, we know that these features are present on many other social platforms, such as LinkedIn, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Although this idea about our dependence on posting (to receive likes) may signal a relationship with self-esteem regulation, we still have good reasons not to worry about it and activate the posting mode when undertaking.

The act of entrepreneurship implies that the entrepreneurial mode is different from the "normal" user condition. It's as if the entrepreneurial mode gives us a status like "now I'm not just any user, now I'm in control."

But what we are not necessarily aware of is that we are advancing a narrative about our entrepreneurial action in general. When Facebook realized the power of the Like button, the social network created something more. According to Fisher (2023), "It's not just that 'likes' provide the social validation we invest so much energy in obtaining; it's that they offer this validation with an immediacy and scale that was unprecedented in human experience" (p. 45). He suggests that life was not like this; applause was rare, especially in public. He indicates that, on social networks, receiving many applauses can be part of a normal morning.

As a result, the entrepreneurial mind, which feels in control, recognizes these actions as small strategic actions. They are just likes, nothing more. Or even, we know the low cost of a post, we know that these applause are not that big, we don't feel victims of the need for these Likes. Consider, for example, a communication plan where entrepreneurs are engaged in a larger, long-term strategy that gives a sense of control – we only decide to support our business, we are just making some posts. Additionally, they may even do it mechanically with the aim of supporting their brand or value proposition. In this sense, they are aware that they do not feel bad when engagement does not occur; they are not in the zone of dependence on the likes associated with each post. It's as if they see themselves as the one flying over, in "post, post, post" mode, because they know they are accumulating results, such as followers and more views. When questioned about depending on the acceptance of Likes, they say they don't even look and that the posts are light, with positive results week after week. Nothing could go wrong with this idea. Additionally, they have a clear thought, resulting from their strategic position, that the real victims are their users.

It's like a basic math that gives carte blanche to advance digital communication on social networks. Consider the number of people around you from the business world, such as digital influencers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners, who promote these methods and practices for social media activity. In this situation, even if your project idea is the most physical in the world, like a plate of food, it becomes natural to think that everything can proceed with actions in digital media and social networks.

In this process, which does not necessarily appear urgent, the cost to be paid may lie in the use of energy, time, and focus on digital activities; with metrics focused solely on the "strategic" action itself, such as the total number of followers or even following some opportunity that suddenly arises on a beautiful day. A simple test, to see if the sociometer is in action for the team of entrepreneurs, consists of noting how happy the team is when a comment from someone successful, like an influencer, appears. See the situation of the user "Uncle of the Valley" of this author:

> *"I don't forget my first user who commented on a post on my channel 'Uncle of the Valley,' about entrepreneurship. It was the angel investor João Kepler. In fact, that day, I had sent a post to a friend who knew João Kepler and tagged him. João Kepler liked the post. It was very cool."* – Uncle of the Valley, Marcio S Galli, https://www.instagram.com/tiodovale

It is inevitable that we want to measure – to observe the results of what we are creating. It may even seem that practical actions are low cost, but in our mind, in our narrative, in the subconscious, you will be connected to it, and it starts to consume you.

The price we pay for increasing our network, our channel, is becoming attached to the narrative that can be fueled by the actions, many of them fragmented, and logically the metrics, such as the total number of followers or a comment from someone special. We become dependent on the narrative as a whole, and it can change our behavior. The more we watch what we sign up for, such as our numbers, the more we believe that our entrepreneurship occurs in that arena, on that stage. But the cost to be paid is not in the possibility of the project's failure if these signals do not resonate with the reality and truths the business or project will face. The cost is in the emotional condition we reach when we face disappointment or when, despite the peaks of dopamine and excitement, we are still pursuing the larger goal that is not resolved day by day. With this, we can find ourselves cornered, or letting time pass, without considering another environment and believing that environment is real.

In defense of another category that posts occasionally without much dedication, a note is worth mentioning. In practice, perhaps many of us do not dedicate specific time to social media posts. It's something light, we do it occasionally like "Look, my company is more than this, I just post and it doesn't even wear us out." But consider the cost to be paid when taking this path, once the individual(s) position themselves in defense, at face value. Who could hold responsibility for something done in free time or in strategic time slots? As if saying, "Oh, it's just some posts I do occasionally." We don't stop to consider that much of what we do, such as things in free time and escapes from time, can actually be things we expect a lot from. It is not logically and well-defined charges, but it consumes silently. And this is exactly the addiction game that Mark Leary suggests. For example, when a person goes there and makes another post believing that perhaps one of them will be a winning post. On one hand, it suggests a construction narrative, without major losses. On the other, it is treading a behavior and a dependence. The focus pays the price. A basic recommendation, if one day you think about "posting occasionally" as an unofficial activity; consider turning this into an official activity. Consider that everything you do for your business should be accounted for during working hours, and you should be responsible and evaluate and judge it in front of your goals.

#### Navigating the System Game

In their pursuit of growth, entrepreneurs may find themselves in a chase for validation, attempting to control - not to say manipulate - the interaction in ways that supports the project development by acceptance from the outside world. Paul Graham, in his talk *Before the Startup with Paul Graham* (How to Start a Startup 2014: Lecture 3), had alerted a whole class of generally young founders to the risk of that instinctive movement: 

> *"[...] Starting a statup is where gaming the system stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. [...] Giving the impression of productivity by sending emails late at night. [...] But in startups, that does not work. [...] There is no boss to trick. There's no, how can you trick people if there's no one to trick? There's only users. [...] You can't, like, wave a red flag at a shark and fool it, it's like, meat or no meat. So, you have to have something people want. [...] And you only prosper to the extend that you do. The dangerous thing is, particularly for you guys, the dangerous thing is that faking does work to some extent with investors. You, if you're really good at knowing what you're talking about. You can fool investors for one, maybe two rounds of funding. But it's not in your interest to. I mean, you're all doing this for equity. You're playing a confidence trick on yourself. You're wasting your own time. *" Paul Graham (2014, Y Combinator: The Vault)

--> 

Charman (2015), in his article *The difference between Bootcamps, Incubators and Accelerators,* raises the question about not only of the self movement of entrepreneurs into the possibility of gaming the system, but also of themselves to be induced by the very systems meant to support them, i.e. accelerators, incubators, and bootcamps. He states: "We see more and more people self-qualifying their own personal achievements, and using these to drive their business and their media behind it." This observation raises an important consideration - that there is to some extent that instinctive game the system possibility - such as the one that Paul Graham might have suggested which likely has origins in universities as known so far - but there is also some other systems of acceleration that might be in fact inducing, to some extent, the possibility of setting the team to seek the results such as in a hurry, which may take the team to not even realize it the necessary conscious view for it. The social system in which we might be navigating cam be in away a probing system - not to say a game - in itself that can confuse us. The systems, supposedly the projection of real life, nevertheless an environment such as percepived by the interactions with social media, may not reflect the actual reality towards your goal.

#### The Mirage of Validation


Andrew Chen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, highlights the well-discussed pattern called the *Trough of Sorrow*, where startups face challenging times after launch efforts with external audiences. In his article, *After the TechCrunch bump: Life in the “Trough of Sorrow"* [^footnote_andrewchen_trough], he first describes the pattern where many founders launch their projects, living through a phase of excitement but one which is followed by a setback - where things are not excited - where the actual work could happen, could start, when an actual slower learning and development phase may happen (a potential opportunity) given that the team can support that long journey. But the point of these investors and practitioners spreading the world about this pattern-curve that looks like a rollercoaser, not a fun one tough, is really a revelation to founders of something that somehow they miss or may enter the path not knowing it. The situational, inescapable, it how consistent founders and teams fall, as in to be taken by strong emotions. He is givin a hand to founders as in "wait, this is normal" or "folks, that wasn't a real product" or "people, things are hard" or "team, don't fight much" or "founder, think twice before quit." 

[^footnote_andrewchen_trough]: In *After the TechCrunch bump: Life in the “Trough of Sorrow"*, Andrew Chen, partner-investor at A16Z, had reflected about a pattern which was discussed with Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, and others colleagues, a pattern that shows a struggle that founders live through as they launch their early "products."

The revelation, from the revealed pattern, not directly stated in the article perhaps due to obvious reasons, can't anyway be missed since the title carries *TechCrunch* [^footnote_techcrunch] in it. In other words, the phenomenon observed cannot be disconnected from the prior movement of them telling stories, in the media, about their "hot new products." Stories from these "hot founders." Andrew too reminds them of that, that "working on press mentions, conferences, etc," is not enough [^footnote_andrew_press]. What is inescapable is: how can these founders be induced into the track of publishing that is about getting news and publications without knowing that the movement from audiences is not really totally real? Why do they miss the nuanced observation, the meta-analysis of what will happen? Why the pattern is real? They do want to interact in cheaper ways? They know that. Are they into a path for improving things, for learning, perhaps pivoting? They know it too. But into that, why is it that when the limelights sets in, they fall into that trap movement as if they got famous and as if their brands or product were real? In other words, they fell into creating a narrative for themselves. How much of that is signal or noise? They generally aren't prepared for that. The fact that excitement takes them to high places, the their down movement to a place of sorrow, reveals that they aren't really in control, that they were essentially controlling and becoming a team-being that are to a certain extent obsessively using that PR-like movement as a self-validation, to be right. Which likely sets them out of their creative and flexible condition. That is why consequences like the considerations to quit become real.

### Being gamed by your own system

Thus, we might signal a possibility. That the frame of growth that entrepreneurs are immersed, as part of the startup process (process?) that they follow, puts them to project and fail mindset, under the pressure to lift data, or signs, so that they can risk more. Thus, they project, such as engaging in communicating, through articles or even cheaper prototypes - the situation of Eric Reis, showed in th Startup Way [Check aorund here if the case of a major coorporation in a denial to prototype a sort of fake system] shows how the projection is part of the culture and model. Products might be simulated in other words, articles serves or that too, landing pages too. Thus, the "launch" is not really a launch, which is also confirmed by Brian Chesky of Airbnb in the multiple lanunches of Airbnb: 

> ".... Launch launch launch " Brian Chesky, Blitzscaling. 

Thus, the entrepreneurs might, at some point, even consider - are we lying in part but being corageous for the sake of coming up with something good, appears as valid. But they might also step into the trap themselves, when data appears. 

IN this regard, Michael Dearing when interviewed by Reid Hoffman has listed, among a list of many things to drop, that "freaking PR" is an area to watch out. Thus, here, consider how your "PR" might take many forms, your artificialization. 



## Conclusão

A jornada empreendedora é frequentemente marcada pela pressão de crescimento e expansão rápida. Em um cenário acelerado e imerso em redes sociais, o empreendedor pode inadvertidamente cair em um jogo perigoso de autovalidação, e assim, sem perceber, criar seu próprio palco ilusório. Impulsionado pela ilusão de progresso e aceitação social, ele pode acabar ignorando que perde foco para outras realidades, como as verdades desconfortáveis. Consequentemente, pode executar uma realidade distorcida que apesar de não ser uma criação deliberada de empreendedor, torna-se uma armadilha fácil em um mundo digital onde o feedback instantâneo e a aparência de sucesso podem ofuscar a realidade. Portanto, é essencial que os empreendedores mantenham a consciência e questionem regularmente a realidade - dos seus projetos - para evitarem serem consumidos, perder energia, entrar em momentos de decepção. 

## Considerations draft 

I am working in a book Slow Down to Win, part 3, I am concerned with a topic, a subject, a theme, which is when the entrepreneurs attempt move with evidence of sucess using signals from the networks around, falling into accelerating into not success. 

Now, here, I will basically give hints to the introduction but also you will notice that my writing shall be used, of course with grammar fixes, William Zinsser style of business plan objective english. 

In terms of introduction, to put a logic for this article, we can lead the reader starting with a situation, which is truthful, undeniable situation, that if she is doing an entrepreneurial path, she has started with a premise that she need to grow. That the startup thesis has a premise: to grow. 

And that it implies with any project that wants to be launched, that it wants to break in the market, towards a market, to thrive in a market. And with that, that world around is likely a validation, such as customers, partners, stakeholders, investors; and that they are likely to get early evidence of these around networks of their own initial networks, as signals. 

In terms of intro, it is worth recognizing that this is not new, to use signals of the ones around, such as an investor. But the complication here that brings us to the reason of this article is that the founders are navigating a  networked space that offers a potentially boosting model, starting with the fact that you can meet online people, for example people you want to hire, cofounders, and more like investors, or customers. The potential is of something that could happen quick, as we know social networks could give us that as they accelerate in public what seems to be signs of popularity. 

Reiterating the theme, where we are going, is that we might be driven by feedback that shall guide ourselves in the accelerated networked world. But it also can misguide us. 

The actual complication is of being out of the winning side, out of what we expect in terms of success which is likely to be nowadays a transactional propability of, say, passing the judge, passing the test with the investor, passing the test with the real user. With that, one may not notice that they are subscribing to an approach of self-validation that drives them not towards what in fact would support them to get there, to thrive.  

In other words, we are likely to subscribe to the behavior of engaging in searching for ways to validate, in a hurry, in accelerated fashion, using signals as we perceive from what our network tells us. The likely revelation, an inflection point in this article, the reason to the article, is that. Thus, you are seeking to find data that offers support, thinking that any hints of support from the social offers a correlation with that truly puts you in the acceleration "esteira / convey".  

In order to give us light about the phenomenon, let's first see how some of the networks and the stages of the public scene of public social systems affect us, or how these systems were designed to self in force some.mechanisms that favors our willingness to find validation and pleasure. 

The situation that depicts how we search for validation and feedback, being out enemy, is explained by Max Fisher in the book "A Máquina do Caos: Como as Redes Sociais Reprogramaram Nossa Mente e Nosso Mundo; Todavia; 2023. " - notice that I want APA Citation. As he highlights how the algorithms of social networks such as Facebook, actually in fact are tuned and resonate with our survival operating model. 

The point presented by Max Fisher in the book, where he pinpoints the "Sociometer" theory of Mark Leary,  is that such sociometer element is what the digital world has launched as a means that provides feedback to the user of what she said - a measurement signal that used "likes" and where she gets likes, the amount of likes, gives the illusion to the user that what she said was good, that she is accepted. That is perceived as good to us, it boost self esteem. 

The psychological explanation offer by The Mark Leary work as referred by Max Fisher, is that Mark Leary has a quite accepted THEORY that defines self esteem, from the pt-br, as "medida psicológica do grau com que as pessoas percebem que são valorizadas nas relações e são socialmente aceitas pelos outros." this is page 44 of Max Fisher above book - APA Citation ok? And keep the quote. 

The point here, in the context of urgency as we are in the social, supports and explains that signals from the steps of us, steps in the digital, acting on social, can be used by us to regulate our steps. We are driving looking in a mirror.   This is my bridge to pinpoint Max Fisher conveying Mark Leary's Sociometer theory, which makes the supporting case to explore dangers in the entrepreneurial navigation - a situation is to be considered for us entrepreneurs and founders - considering that the stage of what happens, where entrepreneurial navigation is likely starting for many,  these days, are likely to start in the digital.  Just consider how many people may start to attempt to innovate, express her ideas and potentially exploring an entrepreneur endeavor, starting from readings, from evaluating an idea that is digital, from iterating with digital things. The base, start point, is likely in the digital as it is the space to ideate that offers solutions such as what can be found via search or social networks. 

In this context, diving a bit here on the path in the digital, there might be many entities/systems/roles that are potencially signaling if the entrepreneur is doing well or not, all around in the digital space as one dives. 

Consider a comparison - as a complication exploration - Imagine a very specific transactional world such as an accelerator system, an incubator system or a challenge, that could in itself use some social validation to put you in the next phase. So, for example, one is subject to certain interactions, and performance is evaluated, then the outcome happens. But now, on the other hand, as the team is in the void of social, it might jump in too many options that may also provide social feeback, which in theory feels great, and might seem to be progress; which is also comparable of the first situation, it pushes you to the next level. But how long will these levels take you to what? To the next stage? What is really the next stage? Imagine that some interactions are so small that takes you to a few likes ahead, which for a founder promotes self esteem but in terms of goals, what really? 

Consider digital influencers, for examples. As they are hubs to others, they act as speeding, or boosted validation. Would then an entrepreneur in it's digital navigation for growth, for passing criteria, seek to try to play the game of seeking validation by entering in certain easier spaces as a means to get validtion or to be promoted? 

Now, moving from the Complication, towards the Q-A, or the Answer/solution, comes back to what you are doing, the question, and navigation in general. The call for us in the way of enlighted navigation is to get serious about your long real goals and the audience system that ultimately validates your goals - central introduction to the point in this essay. 

And in this regard, of enlighted way to move, we need to start from the identificatin of what we might think means passing vs. the what means passing, and in terms of this Answer pilar one, I would day, the awakening about our tendency to game the system, as we are likely aware of the criteria and judgemental mechanism of networks of validation. In this regard, according to Paul Graham , YC mentor and investor, it is conterintuitive for startups the idea of not gaming the system, as perhaps we have seen some of what somewhat working, perhaps in spaces such as university model environment that might have offered to us some indication of gaming the system to work. But now, the approach would not work as there is no boss to trick. 

Bring the quotation from Paul Graham, which is in APA citation for the video youtube whose link https://youtu.be/f4_14pZlJBs?t=687 and title "Before the Startup with Paul Graham (How to Start a Startup 2014: Lecture 3)" position 11 min 28 sec and the quotation block: 

"[] Starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working.  Gaming the system may continue to work, if you go to work for a big company; depending on how broken the company is, you may be able to succeed by sucking up to the right person giving the impression of productivity by sending emails late at night, [..]" 

He adds that in in startups "that does not work" because "there is no boss to trick". He compares startup customers with sharks - there is meat or no meat. 

Now that is a case of what can be seen, as mentioned above, as the longer range case such as a startup in an acceleration track? Perhaps? But also consider the micro version of that, back to the daily activities, to a potential navigation that happens with a willingness to move by tracking feedback. Are we likely to try to regulate, or curate, the validation system? Or could we just be subject to gaming the system without even noticing?  

Notice, Paul Graham has his criteria, and if you do not game that then you can pass.  But what if other validator systems had criteria, or end points, that are meaningless to your goals and yet you could pass their system and for them you would not be gaming? Such as influencers? See the point of this pilar? That although you could well not game a system, is it your responsibility to curate what you think is the system. 

If your network around is applauding you, but what if for things that in the end do not contribute to you towards what you really want?

Therefore in terms of this curation, or your responsibilities, it comes to the complication that you are likely listening to the walls of your network, that you have curated , or anchored yourself, in the first place. Such as the network that happens to be your friends or represent anything in terms of passing to the next sucess stage of real growth.  Consider that, listening to the signals, echo chamber, searching for maintenance of your self esteem as a founder, as an entrepreneur, in alignment with a sociometer. In netshell, the awareness of gaming the system matters, pilar one, and the awarness of the system be already a game that wil puzzle you. System of you being inside a social network's digital realm of not a reality towards your goal. 

The point really to consider is that there is  micro stages that you are likely to play or a macro stage. That the phenomenon is across the board, doing a zoom out, Tom Charman, of ... , wrote: 

"There are also other forms of business building that are sprouting up all over, such as ‘Online Incubators’, ‘Venture Programs’, and even ‘Virtual Accelerators’. But where is this leading? Are we finding ourselves building businesses to support other businesses? Is this an endless bubble and a ticking time bomb that’s waiting to explode like we saw in the banking sector in the recent economic crisis? We see more and more people self-qualifying their own personal achievements, and using these to drive their business and their media behind it." Put APA Citation for the article  "The difference between Bootcamps, Incubators and Accelerators" from the medium article link https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/the-difference-between-bootcamps-incubators-and-accelerators-632a4d4e8bd8 published by Business Daily: Startups, Business Development, Management. 

In conclusion, and reflecting about the evidence  of these moments, consider an approach that is verifiable from the patterns of founders and seen by the pattern identified as  "Trough Of Sorrow'" mentioned written here Andrew Chen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in "After the Techcrunch bump: Life in the “Trough of Sorrow"", where he conveys the situation, according to Andrew, "It captures a viscerally truthful thing about the life of a new company- first you’re excited, then you’re not, and if you stick with it, you just might make it work. It could take years. But you may fail too, you never know until you do it." Retrieved from https://andrewchen.com/after-the-techcrunch-bump-life-in-the-trough-of-sorrow/ "After the Techcrunch bump: Life in the “Trough of Sorrow" 

Make the point that the following illustration, according to Chen  (above) was a depiction of a life of a startup, in his words "A few years back at a YCombinator dinner, Paul Graham and the other partners drew a great diagram depicting the life of a new product." But it shows the interesting first spike of attention/feedback, the idea of super momentum that they have seen founders go through and identified in the chart as "TechCrunch of INitiation" followed by the, down of momentum noted as "Wearing Off of Novelty" and then the "Trough of Sorrow". These labels, although a Joke [footnote: Paul Graham in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=173261  on April 25, 2008 wrote "I didn't add those labels, though. Those were added by Trevor as a joke."] clearly indicates an indication that the signals perceived as "TechCrunch of INitiation" are in fact connected with their own effort of launching, or publishing.

 Wouldn't that be a case, for us to consider the reflection in concluding, that one, the team, that perhaps has projected in its networks, given a social network that gave them temporary projection of success, naturally pushes them towards any new stage of post-mortem, a pattern, of always a "Wearing Off of Novelty"" Which is nothing more than in fact nothign to do with novelty and the realization that in a way they either gamed the system or didn't game but entered a social validity system in the first place that does not trully represent any indication of the market they are after. 

And to give a discount to the teams, they don't usually know where they going, right? But anyway, still the reflection that we are moving with signals is here, and that as individuals we have that thing build in, the need for preserving, acceptance and approval.. But the key lessons, all digital systems are also doing their jobs, signaling as they are players of the networks, as judges, not always being able to feed the right but propagaging tiwh the lenses they see, they get a skim in the game, a digiral influencer, an accelerator, and more. They do not track the holistic to the end, your story, right? An accelerator cares more about the winner. 

Strong saying of my workd, the thing inside you, you can't turn that off as you are thursthy see to maintain the state of acceptance. In pt-br "Estamos com sede para sermos aceitos e vamos operar com o feedback que estamos vendo. As pessoas ao lado, a rede ao lado. Cabe a nos curamos as redes de validação, escaparmos das redes que promovem sucesso iniciail na busca do sucesso além do muro. " 

Now before the conclusion we should have passed through the notion of structured holes of Ronald Burt to indicate that one might be connected and have benefits, but also Ronald indicates that the qualitative approach is to break beyond too many contacts in a given network and access diversity, in other words, to reach out to other networks. The following quote  "Network benefits are enhanced in several ways. There is a higher volume of benefits because more contacts are included in the network. Beyond volume, diversity enhances the quality of benefits.
Nonredundant contacts ensure exposure to diverse sources of
information." APA data Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition
Por Ronald S. Burt , Harvard University Press, 30 de jun. de 2009 - 

Explain a bit that the social network of your friends, or groups, can self inforce the same benefits; and that also the new algorithms of pushing same interests, in a way does the same.
