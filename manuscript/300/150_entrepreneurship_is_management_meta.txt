## Research points 

* A balancing view to Christina Wodtke's point - against outcome-based OKR - Christina wrote that "Key Results need to be outcomes, not outputs. If you make a key result “launch this feature” and halfway through the quarter you discover it won’t move the number you hoped it would, you’re stuck. You committed to that feature and now you feel like you have to deliver it. But if you pick a number you want to move, you can try dozens of things to change it." The point of the view from Andy Grove, IMHO, is that you need to be able to see whappens. When both cases fail, the option A - output - is better for knowing what was done. The option B could be implemented like gambling. In the point is, in the extremme bad usage of each, which does worse?

* Management linked to business performance - Peter Drucker, in The Practice of Management, p.8, The Role of Management, indicates that "In a competitive economy, above all, the quality and performance of the managers determine the success of a business, indeed they determine its survival. " (p.8)

( ) Make intro 

* Situation - We all set goals, and our goals exist so that we can do some work. 
* Situation - But we find complications on our way. That what we said is wrong, that we become too anxious, the team is not anymore motivated, goals are not meaningless, there is no room to learn, an more. 

* Complication - We gravitate towards performance, and we lock goals, or as we lock goals. We respond to goals even when they were very unclear, more like a mission or vision. We tend to lock so that we can be productive. 
* ( ) Need to improve complication.
