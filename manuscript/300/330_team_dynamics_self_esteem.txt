* conscious business - do you have the time?

* Maslow, p. 178 - Maslow points out potential problems when people with different levels of Intelligence (as measured by iq) are interacting. Such difference between people would create a tension in the collaborative environment, such as for the less smart to potentially engage in self-defense, to even get hostile. Yet such tension would be potentially minimized if consciousness is developed about the nature of the interaction. Because people would not misunderstand the others when they have conflicts. For maslow, there is a connection with self-esteem. This thought also supports the idea, mentioned somewhere else in this work, and presented by Andy Grove (Only the Paranoid Survive) that a great culture needs to acknowledge the role of fear and people should never be punished or feel fear regarding their ability to speak. Allowance for speaking, without the fear of being punished, is a key element at innovative companies and a essential trait for collaborating teams. Not fearing trouble is a team version of self steem. For Silicon Valley legend, Bill Draper, one essential attribute of venture investors is not fearing failure; an idea that is perhaps intrinsic of the field exactly because venture investing is a business of ups and downs, or as bill said "some lemons" (get fast clip of Bill).

* Regarding self-esteem, actually the concrete point from Maslow is that that people engage in defense mechanisms in order to safeguard their self-estreem. P.178
