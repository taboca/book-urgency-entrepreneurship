# Productivity and innovation culture 

<!-- 

( ) Review (1998, citation Maslow from the Maslow on Management. )

--> 

É importante lembrar que a razão de chamar de metro de ação é que você estabeleçe uma cultura de viver e trabalhar sempre orientada as ações. O método da ação de Scott Belsky reconhece a necessidade de estabelecer uma cultura, ou ritual — comportamentos orientadas as ações.

Olhando sob a ótica da cultura, e como o processo pode se estabelecer em times, o autor Michael Dearing, em Creative Destruction Blitzscaling,  diz que as pessoas de uma organização podem se tornar responsáveis pela valorização das suas ideias. E que, com o tempo, a gestão passa a obter padrões, se elas são efetivas naquele processo e então você pode ou não estabalecer um sistema de alocação de recursos para os projetos.  O comentário do Michael está situado em [40m @ Capitalism, Creativity and Creative Destruction](https://youtu.be/3vCdfa_aeI8?t=39m52s).

Por exemplo, para validar a ideia ou priorizar a execução delas, ele refere-se a uma ideia, um mercado interno (marketplace), que pode ser estabelecido dentro das empresas como sendo uma forma de criar competição interna e mecanismo de seleção para priorização do uso dos melhores recursos com os projetos mais promissores. No exemplo apresentado, o critério de análise foi NPV (Net Present Value) que leva em consideração questões como a lucratividade de projetos existentes.  Ele também apresenta o contraponto, que colocar prioridade nos negócios mais lucrativos pode se tornar um fator negativo porque grandes empresas se tornam escravas dos seus próprios negócios.

O exemplo do Michael Dearing não deve ser visto como sendo uma recomendação sobre a forma mas é um validador com relação a existência de processos internos e como grupos de gestão olham para estes. Também sobre a necessidade de constantemente monitorar as chances ou como os processos causam impactos com relação aos objetivos — como criar uma cultura onde todos são responsáveis por curar o processo que quer validar quais ações são as que devem ser priorizadas.

## The improvement of lives of individuals as part of their organizations

So if we pick an identity, and we run with it, and we see ourselves as sort of protagonists of a story, and if we know we have good serious reasons to do so, such as the results of what we do an help us to make a living, then the fusion happens. And, as we have seen, it happens the fusion with what we do, in the field, schools, social networks, work, hobbies, family, entrepreneurial project, all that matters. But a key factor to be considered has to do with the amount of time that we give these episodes as they unfold. Work as we know it affects in big way the subjects we bring to our homes, the themes we talk with others too. It is clearly that a lot of what happens in work, such as the social communications, the challenges and expectations, comes to our lives for too many of us, and so that we bring to the ones around us, not limited to the people from the location where things are happening. Perhaps this phenomenon happens more with people involved in entrepreneurial activities as opposed to people that have the sort of dual reality of work vs. family. Anyway, the notion of an identity - which is tied to the stories that we progress - affects our future and the future of our companies.

What comes from that is that the environment impacts us, to good or bad. And there are the situations of these projects, such as the work that we depend, that can impact our lives positively too. This viewpoint seems to be what Maslow had seen, that human being that is not yet prepared - in terms of Maslow self-actualizing conditions - can also improve themselves given the conditions:  

> "Proper management of the work lives of human beings, of the way in which they earn their living, can improve them and improve the world and in this sense be a utopian or revolutionary technique. " Abraham Maslow, The Attitude of Self-Actualizing People to Duty, Work, Mission, p.xx (1998)






<!-- our identity in this -->

Let's us consider especially a powerful message, that Walter Fisher bought, "Narratives enable us to understand the actions of others 'because we all live out narratives in our lives and because we understand our own lives in terms of narratives. '" reference is p.83, After Virtue, Narratives of the Self, Studies in Social Identity. [We need to find a new way to deal with this citation as it is a citation that incorporates another citation. ]

This notion might suggest two themes for reflection. One is that our identity is maintained with narratives. So it could be a bit of an an absurd to think that who you are, or what you sense of what you are, is more like a story and even more strong, a story that you might have created, that you are editing it. 

But even if your general story of life isn't written as a story at a conscious level, explicit, we do have indications that people seem to adhere to their identity when they are engaged in works, like a job, or a project, or running a company. As indicated in "..." Andy Grove brought a reflection about the identities of executives that form as a result of a success, which creates for them complications to see with an external eye. He wrote, in Only the Paranoid Survive, p.x:

And before we move on here, consider for a while about our ability to anchor ourselves in certain places. How we might respond to engaging, or not engaging, with prompts in front of us, in many situations using an fast, or high performance, mechanism of judging ourselves.

I recall an episode where someone asked my mother for a visit. My mother instantly replied that she was very busy with her things, helping family and her sisters, and so on. Since I was in the position of an external eye, and also felt as in being in a position to be a critic of her, I said "mother, you do nothing." Of course, my observation to her didn't help her. Perhaps it even pushed her to believe that all that she was doing was even move important. At least more important than listening to that sort of comment. And it make sense, doesn't it? That we are in our bubbles. Like the situation that Andy Grove brought up was mainly a celebration that a lot of the people around you, especially when there is hierarchy, are echoing and maintaining the bubble. And plus, and we should not forget this, we are socializing too with the folks around us, colleagues too. Thus, a lot that goes on with people in work is commonly perceived a sort of identity too. We seem to know how to separate as in our lives from a work identity. But still, we also know how to maintain the work identity under a certain control, as we might know that we depend on it. Thus, it does not matter much if the a work identity really connects with the general identity of us. What matters, at least for thus reflection here about narratives, is that we do such as effort to keep that identity working, doing a good job. Again, because we might think that we depend on it. Such as when our future depends on it.

The secondary aspect, that narrative is how we make sense of things, deserves a bit of thought as well. Let's consider the process of entrepreneurship, such as when we start working in a new project, and how narrative driven progress influences us, again, to do good, and also to do bad.


## Network effects potential and social impact 

Thus, perhaps, communities on top of platforms, and the values, economic, social and psychological, and ultimately if a platform offers space for all the sorts of characters of beings. The blitzscaling authors Reif Hoffman and Chris Yeh bring up pointers to the very aspect, and concern, that can or should be considered when platforms are being created. The geneal well-bring concern is certainly a function to be considered, and what it takes for a platform to endure. 

One point, brought my Max Fisher (Fisher, 2023, p. 9144), is of a discovery by DiResta, where Facebook has optimized its algorithm, such as based on engagments, which would result in supporting interactions of users of a kind which happens to be the kind that maximizes interaction. Thus, the algorithm does not really know what is being said and if that is really causing harm to people, such as helping them to organize radical movements. Basically, what they are saying is that the system, in order to optimize for a metric, like engagament; the system is not aware of impact to users, such as psychological impact. Thus, the network effect show a potential, for psychological change and social change. Now the topic, to close this chapter, might start with the recognition that a lot of startup ideas are considering network effects, and are envisioned to become network platforms. We are also assuming the general intention of growh, and also that the Blitzscaling movement is about higher speed, for when the situation calls for that. In this regard, and under the lenses of our goal - of celebrating non urgency, of honoring awareness - we should consider that any networking platforms need to account that the usage of the network by constituents causes health changes for the constients. Chris Yeh, makes that call at the end of the book. I would even consider if the 4th book of Chris and Reid could be about that aspect, as we are going through a new stage of development with AI-based systems defining a hybrid space of humans and systems. 

<!-- Make note of Chris Yeh quote or section --> 

Now, a point of view, to suggest a line of reflection, may show some synchronity with an analogy from Abraham Maslow, where he elaborates a situation of an enlighted salesperson as the one concerned with the sales and also concerned with the situation of being around - not to totally focus in the present needs such as what could be the case of a salesperson that will do a one-time sales to someone and never see them anymore, thus which depending on his connection with the individual, will likely not be interested in defending the other human needs in the society and in long term. 

Motivated by this line of thinking of Maslow, there is the thinking of separation between the users, the roles in a given platform. A company, for example, may have employees or 3rd-party suppliers, or partners. The difference between the separation might be around and about recognition that certain activities can be strategic, or that there is a lot being learned about that role and their functions. Actually, it is important for us to check when and how and why people should be in or outside. But if we take Uber, for example, the drivers are not employees, they are users, in what Uber - the startup industry as a whole - recognizes as a multisided marketplace. In this system and network, the drivers also form a community. The company might be interested in listening to them so that their needs can be satisfied, of course with an supervision so that value continues to be generated for the network and for the constituents interaction health in the network. But a possible topic, or distinction, between drivers as users versus drivers as employees, should be taken into account - mental health. Mental health, although neglected also by many companies, is generally accepted as a valid theme for human resource professionals. Then as certain group of users happen to be part of platforms, would their mental health be considered as key, such as in situations that mental health is not directly linked to value?

It might also be good to check The Cold Start Problem to see if Andrew Chen talks about anything in terms of awareness for human interaction.

## Extended integration 

<!-- 

    This part was in winning, part 1 

 --> 

* Consider the situation with Blitzscaling, p.289 and p.301 for the responsible Blitzscaling and requirement of Blitzscaling for the entrepreneur, which is to be an always learner, p.301, and also what Reid and Chris referred as paradox, p.301, which has to do with a need for estability and peace, which is a requirement which seems to aligh with diversity. 

Therefore, we want to focus in our beings as supporters for the projects of now but without losing ties with the projects of after. There is no way to advance with entrepreneurship without facing the reality that you need to be around, as things change in front of you. What I care about, that helps me to support this line of conduct, is that I care about you and want you to be around, winning. 

I want you to advance your life, to improve yourself on the way, to improve your team, and your organization. Therefore, it is a conscious winning, an enlighted winning, a winning idea. And with that, to help the world with your energy, alive. As you engage with teams, I want you to do it in a way that they shall be interested in staying around, you. As you launch your ideas into the world, I also want you to do it in a way that people are helping, you.

## Reducing impulses 

Benjamin Zander became widely known after his inspirational talk, "The Transformative Power of Classical Music" (Zander, 2008), although he is also a renowned conductor and co-author of 'The Art of Possibility'. But inside him comes a fire that allowed him to use classical music to enlighten many about what is leadership.

In the talk he uses classical music to guide us through an idea about leadership for - in my view - driving towards maturity. He sits in the Steinway piano and tells the audience that is going to play like of a seven-year-old that just started to take lessons. We can see and hear from his acting that each key note is being played hard and the "kid's body" moves in synchronicity with every key strike - a struggle for every note. Then he plays what would be the same kid after one more year of lessons, and plays the nine, and ten, where the audience confirms how the kids's body movements reduce and how notes seem like letters transforming into words and phrases. The audience suddenly laughs as he interrupts the playing with a remark that the eleven-year-old is when they usually give up. Then he plays the what would be eleven-year-old if he had continued to take lessons - where his body swifts beautifully with the music phrases. His explanation follows: 

> "Now, what happened was not maybe what you thought, which is, he suddenly became passionate, engaged, involved, got a new teacher, he hit puberty, or whatever it is. What actually happened was the impulses were reduced. You see, the first time, he was playing with an impulse on every note. And the second, with an impulse every other note. You can see it by looking at my head. The nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes. The 10-year-old, on every eight notes. And the eleven-year-old, one impulse on the whole phrase. I don't know how we got into this position. [He pauses his body shifted 45 degress.] I didn't say, "I'm going to move my shoulder over, move my body." No, the music pushed me over, which is why I call it one-buttock playing. It can be the other buttock. [He moves his upper body to the other side where the center of gravity sits on the other side.] You know, a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing, when I was working with a young pianist. He was the president of a corporation in Ohio. I was working with this young pianist, and said, "The trouble with you is you're a two-buttock player. You should be a one-buttock player." I moved his body while he was playing. And suddenly, the music took off. It took flight. The audience gasped when they heard the difference. Then I got a letter from this gentleman. He said, "I was so moved. I went back and I transformed my entire company into a one-buttock company."* 
> (Zander, 2008, 02:24-03:26)

Now, the above scene seem far from the real world of entrepreneurship but the inspired CEO movement perhaps saw a hint for a principle of maturity, or growth, that is natural of human beings. A principle that might be applicable as we engage in activititis, such as working with a team with a goal. 

One thing to note, first, from the illustration of the young learning piano, is that he started playing a well-known classical music. Thus, it is fair to say that anyone starts to learn on top of an existing "ongoing conversation," in the case of classical piano lessons it might be a complex score which the good professor might have simplified, taken certain notes out, reducing complexities, so that some the apprentice can play, although using effort, and living the struggle. Still, the music is there already. Then, as the kid continues to ride the train, coming from a station of not being able to feel the whole power of, or coherence of, the music; still should at the stations ahead, as he gets used to not struggling for all the small stones on the way, he naturally gets to see the path and the river, where is it going, the whole song. In the work situation, a young apprentice might also be thrown to play a complex music that is being played, although managers might cut complex parts so that activities can be meaningful to what goes on. The secret of maturity, then unfolds, as the possibility that playing, and playing, might offer a door for being able to hear the meaning of the longer phrases, such as the intentions of projects, the goals. The equivalent to "an impulse on every note" in the corporate setting can be seen as "attention to the specific task at hand". And if one does not give up and if the setting offers possibility, one shall then be able to access higher-order phrases. Benjamin adds, at the end of his talk, of what could be the leader conductor: 

> *"Now, I had an amazing experience. I was 45 years old, I'd been conducting for 20 years, and I suddenly had a realization. The conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound. My picture appears on the front of the CD [cover of a compact disk; laughter of audience.] But the conductor doesn't make a sound. He depends, for his power, on his ability to make other people powerful. And that changed everything for me. It was totally life-changing. People in my orchestra said, "Ben, what happened?" That's what happened. I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people.

The shift that Benjamin were able to see may not be straightforward to all the conductors, or to all executors, or all entrepreneurs. What makes Benjamin an inspirational leader is that he teaches his students to shift their roles, to transform themselves, from people that focuses on specific keys to people that can listen to phrases, and finally to be able to play beautifully the whole song. Conversely, I may now connect the dots, that the CEO of that Ohio corporation might have seen the transformative power of reducing impulses, or the human ability to shift from key results, or the activities from the doing, the struggles of specific efforts; towards what matters, towards goals and objectives, towards the meaning of the whole phrase, towards the vision of a company.
