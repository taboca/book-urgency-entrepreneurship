# Foco Não Tão Radical

Quando a função empreendedora acontece para destruir criativamente o antigo e mudar a realidade, ela faz isso mais por realizar coisas[^nota_de_rodapé_schumpeter_empreendedor_realizando_coisas] e menos por causa da teoria, ficção, invenções e outros arranjos necessários para prosperar. Focando no trabalhador - chamemo-los de realizadores, executores, empreendedores - logo após colocarem seu capacete e se posicionarem na trajetória, imediatamente visualizam que, se querem realizar coisas em casa, não podem apenas estar fazendo coisas, como realizar coisas arbitrariamente. Em outras palavras, os realizadores vão longe, mas fazem isso chamando o controle terrestre - estabelecendo metas e temendo incessantemente[^nota_de_rodapé_medos_impulsionadores] serem desviados no espaço das oportunidades.

[^nota_de_rodapé_medos_impulsionadores]: Discutimos na primeira parte como os medos desempenham um papel significativo no impulso dos empreendedores, ou no verdadeiro empreendedor de suas vidas. Tememos falhar, tememos estar perdendo tempo, tememos ficar sem combustível ou oxigênio, e esse medo também pode nos fazer correr bastante rápido, entrando até mesmo em um movimento destemido de ação.

[^nota_de_rodapé_schumpeter_empreendedor_realizando_coisas]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), o renomado economista e cientista político austro-americano conhecido por suas teorias sobre desenvolvimento econômico e ciclos de negócios, em "Capitalismo, Socialismo e Democracia", enfatiza a caracterização de "realizar coisas" (p. 132) como um elemento essencial da função empreendedora. Ele argumenta que esse aspecto é ainda mais crucial do que outros, como a capacidade do empreendedor de inventar novas coisas ou criar condições para a empresa prosperar.

Agora, ao considerarmos a situação de uma startup, o tema de gestão por objetivos aparece não apenas como uma resposta para ser produtivo (no sentido filosófico), mas por causa de necessidades externas (no sentido material) que crescem conforme a equipe cresce com mais pessoas, e mais diferenças, e, portanto, a pressão para descobrir como cada um pode contribuir. Além disso, isso vai junto com a necessidade de clareza sobre as principais prioridades pelos trabalhadores. Em uma pesquisa[^nota_de_rodapé_michaeldearing_objetivos_claros] com 250 pessoas trabalhando em empresas de alto crescimento, 70% delas confirmaram como extremamente importante ter clareza sobre as principais prioridades da empresa.

[^nota_de_rodapé_michaeldearing_objetivos_claros]: Michael Dearing discute a importância de entender as principais prioridades em empresas de alto crescimento em seu curso 'Autoestudo GM2: Estabelecendo Objetivos & Medindo Desempenho'. Neste curso, Dearing pesquisou 250 pessoas trabalhando em empresas de alto crescimento sobre a clareza das principais prioridades e a qualidade da gestão de equipes. Ele descobriu que 70% dos respondentes confirmaram que entender as prioridades principais era extremamente importante; além disso, o estudo mostrou uma correlação entre a qualidade da gestão e a clareza sobre as principais prioridades.

Embora olhar para esse horizonte possa soar um alerta para o que está à frente, isso não é inteiramente suficiente para os primeiros realizadores - permita-me colocar desta forma - se distraírem dos desafios reais do dia, que podem parecer como "saltar de um penhasco tentando montar um avião durante a queda,"[^nota_de_rodapé_reidhoffman_aviao_penhasco] como vividamente descrito por Reid Hoffman. Em outras palavras, o verdadeiro chamado que fazemos ao controle terrestre nos coloca no que é mais importante - fazer primeiro o que precisa ser feito e, depois, voltar para organizar coisas como arrumar post-its como parte da reflexão[^nota_de_rodapé_michaeldearing_realizando_postits] e do trabalho organizacional.

[^nota_de_rodapé_reidhoffman_aviao_penhasco]: Ao discutir a natureza das startups, Reid Hoffman celebra a metáfora na qual, na situação de uma startup, "você se joga de um penhasco e monta um avião durante a queda," (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2013) para notar vividamente sobre os desafios como a situação de mortalidade e de foco.

[^nota_de_rodapé_michaeldearing_realizando_postits]: A Harrison Metal ilustra - através da animação "Objetivos & Resultados Chave" [Harrison Metal, 2016] - brilhantemente como geralmente lidamos com a organização de metas com a situação de um proprietário de negócios que começa com uma aspiração inicial, se envolve com as atividades do dia a dia e, em seguida, se empenha em fazer a análise em retrospectiva, gerando ideias na esperança de que arrumar post-its possa melhorar sua produtividade, o que inevitavelmente leva à gestão por objetivos, se feito corretamente.

Mas a complicação permanece - dado que a conversa contínua sobre gestão por objetivos está viva - que nós, gerentes de nossos objetivos reais e concretos de agora, ficamos ocupados com a realização de coisas, sob o tema central "como devo contribuir da melhor forma?" e vivendo as pressões do momento. Essa realidade nos empurra a evitar o envolvimento mais formal com o tema - pois parece uma distração, ou o próprio desperdício de recursos que é improdutivo, diante do nosso desejo de alcançar os objetivos.

Isso nos leva a ficar desconfortáveis com o tema - até o ponto de duvidar da aplicabilidade de qualquer ideia para gerenciar metas e progressos, ou adiar para mais tarde como se fosse algo que pode ser usado no momento certo, como depois de mais tração existir ou a equipe ser maior.

Mas realmente, e para ser justo, nossa inclinação não é por preguiça ou apenas pelo puro impulso por resultados que coloca a carroça na frente dos bois. Podemos ter muitos motivos para estar irritados e frustrados com muita coisa acontecendo enquanto corremos pelos corredores do hipermercado da startup, olhando as capas de tudo que parece tão coerente - dado que tudo se promove como o Santo Graal para nossos problemas. Nós lemos as letras pequenas e nos envolvemos de forma responsável em verificar as coisas, como quando pedimos opiniões de colegas ou críticos. Considere a visão de Fried e Hansson (2018, p. 32) - os renomados fundadores da bem-sucedida empresa do Vale do Silício Basecamp - em *Making it up as you go* sobre como eles administram sua empresa sem seguir metas rígidas, como planos de 2, 3 ou até 5 anos:

> *"A cada seis semanas ou mais, decidimos no que estaremos trabalhando a seguir. E esse é o único plano que temos. Qualquer coisa além disso é considerada um 'talvez, vamos ver.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 32).

Além disso, eles nos dão um bom argumento para a situação onde metas rígidas podem ser prejudiciais ao progresso:

> *"Muita ansiedade corporativa vem da realização de que a empresa estava fazendo a coisa errada, mas é tarde demais para mudar a direção por causa do 'Plano.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33)

Há verdade nisso - verdade que também nos guiará adiante - mas por agora eu prefiro considerar a complicação de uma inclinação que, baseada nesses valores, constrói uma lógica positiva que se soma - como um investimento - onde cada dia podemos desenvolver uma visão fundamentada de que isso tem a ver com mais uma prática de gestão do mundo lento da administração, que simplesmente não é aplicável à nossa situação. O que perdemos é que o "não" que dizemos a esses temas não é apenas um "sim" às coisas que queremos realizar. É um sim para nossa própria solução de gestão, já que fazer as coisas acontece de qualquer forma. Uma nota de Jonathan Nightingale em *How Fucked Up Is Your Management* nos ajuda a ver os perigos da inclinação positiva que às vezes nos apoia a descartar a gestão:

> *"Não preciso que você seja o melhor do mundo em gestão. Mas se você não planeja ser, se você não vai ser realmente estudioso e dedicado a isso, então pelo amor de Deus, pare de mexer com isso. Prometo que você não pode construir um sistema de gestão melhor no seu tempo livre."* (Nightingale, J., 2017, p. 23)

Portanto, aqui nos colocamos em um dilema onde estamos engajados e preocupados com a produtividade, em fazer o nosso melhor em direção aos nossos objetivos, mas igualmente preocupados com os aspectos de quando e por que. Em outras palavras, vale a pena se envolver com o aprendizado sobre definição de metas e gestão de metas e, se sim, quando é o momento certo para considerar a aplicabilidade de qualquer método ou estrutura formal?

A resposta curta para se envolver é *sim*, porque você está envolvido se tiver objetivos à frente - mesmo que esteja sozinho - e muito envolvido em uma situação de equipe. Em outras palavras, você começou, está usando tempo, energia, e então você está no comando de um tremendo impacto. Isso também resolve o Quando, para que possamos considerar o Como:

Primeiro, nossa estratégia para avançar deve trazer uma oportunidade de refletir sobre o problema da definição de metas e a gestão de metas, mas mais como uma conversa. Assim, estando fora da pressão de ter que mapear o que fazer - e como as coisas se aplicam às nossas equipes - o que geralmente acontece em tempo real com a leitura e aprendizado dos métodos ou estruturas. Minha esperança é que possamos levar algo conosco que seja prático para agora, e para nossas vidas e para nossas equipes, de uma maneira que possa ser duradoura.

Dito isso, vamos avançar com OKR - Objetivos e Recursos-Chave - uma estrutura de gestão para definição de metas e progresso com metas. Alinhados a essa estratégia, nossa abordagem terá menos a ver com a introdução da estrutura - ou sugerindo-a como um manual - e mais com "consultar o OKR" ou "verificar com conversas sobre OKR". Essa abordagem deve nos colocar para participar das conversas contínuas e ricas que o OKR tem oferecido, como veremos nas próximas seções; mas não vamos colocar a carroça na frente dos bois e começar honrando o que faz o OKR ser ótimo como uma conversa, além de ser uma estrutura.

#### OKR como uma Conversa Rica

Sob nossa estratégia, considero o OKR como uma abordagem de gestão estratégica. Originado no Vale do Silício na Intel Corporation, ganhou uso generalizado após sua adoção pelos funcionários do Google. Em resumo, o OKR sobreviveu ao teste do tempo - e à potencial objeção - da inteligência coletiva dos trabalhadores de alta tecnologia[^nota_de_rodapé_marciogalli_pessoas] dessas empresas do Vale do Silício. Também é justo reconhecer a enorme quantidade de novas pessoas que, através do OKR, abraçaram as amplas conversas de gestão que acontecem internamente e fora dessas organizações. Uma pesquisa informal feita por Kris Duggan[^nota_de_rodapé_krisduggan_pesquisaokr] durante a palestra intitulada *Usando OKRs para Obter Resultados, também conhecida como ‘Segredos para Alcançar Seus Objetivos’*, oferece insights sobre sua gama de aplicabilidade e popularidade:

[^nota_de_rodapé_marciogalli_pessoas]: Baseado em minha experiência na Netscape Communications no início dos anos 2000, nosso ambiente consistia em muitos indivíduos criativos e inteligentes que estavam desenvolvendo o futuro da Internet, usando ferramentas da Internet para colaborar e que pareciam caóticos em seu envolvimento com a ideia de quebrar normas.

> *"A propósito, levantem a mão, quem realmente faz OKRs agora? OK, cerca de um terço de vocês. E quem está pensando em OKRs? OK, um terço de vocês e então um terço de vocês veio pelas bebidas e jantar grátis, eu acho. OKRs são simplesmente uma metodologia de gestão que ajuda as empresas a focar seus esforços no que é importante e a fazer isso em escala em toda a organização. Eu não acho que você possa ser pequeno demais para pensar em OKRs. Uma ou duas pessoas em uma equipe, grupo, divisão, departamento, empresa, ou até literalmente 60, 80, 100 mil pessoas poderiam fazer isso em escala."*

[^nota_de_rodapé_krisduggan_pesquisaokr]: É importante reconhecer o profundo envolvimento de Kris Duggan com OKRs. Sua empresa, BetterWorks, fornece uma ferramenta para definir, acompanhar e gerenciar metas via OKRs; e recebeu investimento de John Doerr, um proeminente investidor do Vale do Silício e renomado evangelista dos OKRs.

À medida que avançamos com o OKR, a boa notícia é que não estaremos cavalgando nele enquanto tentamos aprender a cavalgar e, ao mesmo tempo, preocupados com os desafios do roteiro. Digo isso porque o OKR pode ser visto como um animal temperamental onde as pessoas tentam controlá-lo, domá-lo, e então elas ficam confusas, caem, se machucam; embora essa ilustração não seja tão triste quanto a possibilidade de ficarem frustradas com o OKR e desistirem, até mesmo desistindo da conversa sobre os desafios da definição de metas. Ao usar o OKR para fins de reflexão, estaremos considerando as coisas em perspectiva, focaremos no elemento temperamental subjacente real - o elemento humano - que torna a definição de metas e a gestão de metas tão difíceis. Jonathan Nightingale (2017) captura bem esse sentimento quando diz que '[g]erenciar pessoas é excepcionalmente difícil de fazer bem. As pessoas são complexas, e as organizações estão cheias delas' (p. 23).

Com isso, nossa reflexão será mais como conversar caminhando, com a intenção de nos ajudar e aos nossos colegas quando precisarmos realmente caminhar ou falar e agir no domínio da gestão de metas. Vamos começar verificando por que metas de cima para baixo são importantes, o que o OKR nos diz sobre o uso de metas fortes ou ambiciosas ou possivelmente de longo prazo, e as considerações para lidar com metas quando o caminho é incerto. Em seguida, verificaremos como a gestão de metas - e o OKR junto com ela - lida com a necessidade de correção de curso. Na última seção, consideraremos as complexidades de medir e julgar o progresso e como a perspectiva radical demais pode influenciar o julgamento pobre da equipe.

Why is it that when a young worker enters an organization they find tops-down goals so impactful to their lives? And I don't mean impactful as seen by the eyes of the executives that deploy them expecting from them mostly outcomes; but impactful in ways that brings tears from their eyes, that drains their creative potential if not their health. Although that can be an extremme, yet it doesn't disconnect from point from the Basecamp founders - that state of anxiety - where the doers are harmed and with that the impact turns out to be the lower performance to the organization. But if tears can't be seen, still it drive us nuts when we feel the feedback of that need for speed where tops-down goals mostly expects the gauges to reach high limits - expectations that are careless to whoever is behind the wheel. Much of that sounds like the harsh bad old days where self-called masters expected from people, their time and energy, and saw them as effort-deploying units that happens to walk and talk, and to be tired. 

Moreover, and even if we set ourselves in the startup way and become in the positions to manage ourselves and our own organizations, all that unfolds can be a big confusion - that has the power to impact in terms of making us not excited with the subject of managing goals and progressing with them. We get confused to see what appears to be a conflict between that tops-down view and the reality of the doers, of doing it. Without figuring things out, and when it is time to recruit others, and and even if we do not do it in the most brutal old ways,we still can't figure much what to do except to set some breezy version of setting tops-down expectation and expect outcomes in the hope that their subordinates can do it. That seems to be an unsolvable battle anyways, on one side the thing to do and on the other an outstanding request that sets an outcome and expects - such as from the doer to find their way. 

Following up with the perspective of not reinventing the wheel and growing from what management has given to us, let us move on towards the historical perspective from the evolution of goal-setting and management of goals and start by recognizing that the tops-down goals - that in many circumstances appears to be so harsh on us - can actually go along well with the reality of the doers where the bottoms-up discoveries make the real change and brings about the opportunity. And as said earlier, and as we go along with these elements, will be be checking with the OKR conversation.

#### Historical perspective - from management of time to the management of people

What appears from the historical perspective, the flight from above, is that the science of goal management is evolving to reduce that *fight from above*. What I mean is that management is adapting goal management, or stretching it, to enable more collaboration and by that more doers to become real constributors and so that they can achieve goals - especially that aspiring and ambitious goals are more frequent as opposed to the expected commitments where humans are expected to act as robots. The following passage from Stephen Covey, from *7 Habits of Highly Effective People*, we are moving from time management towards the managent of ourselves: 

> *"In the area of time management, each generation builds on the one before it - each one moves us toward greater control of our lives. The first wave or generation could be characterized by notes and checklists, an effort to give some semblance of recognition and inclusiveness to the many demands placed on our time and energy.
> The second generation could be characterized by calendars and appointment books. This wave reflects an attempt to look ahead, to schedule events and activities in the future.
> The third generation reflects the current time management field. It adds to those preceding generations the important idea of prioritization, of clarifying values and of comparing the relative worth of activities based on their relationship to those values. In addition, it focuses on setting goals – specific long-, intermediate-, and short-term targets toward which time and energy would be directed in harmony with values. It also includes the concept of daily planning, of making a specific plan to accomplish those goals and activities determined to be of greatest worth. 
> While the third generation has made a significant contribution, people have begun to realize that "efficient" scheduling and control of time are often counterproductive. The efficiency focus creates expectations that clash with the opportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs and to enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis."* 
> (Covey, Stephen., 1989, p.149-150)

He concludes, since we moved on from that *time management* to the management of ourselves, that we shifted from expecting tasks to be done - the *things* in *time*. And, as the fourth generation, we started an interest in accomplishing results and building relationships.

With the early justification for going along with OKR - in terms of popularity in the space of high-growth organizations - as a lively conversation about goal-setting and management of goals, this context calls for checking the historical development of OKR. OKR didn't happen overnight but going backwards, its popularity was championed by John Doerr [^footnote_johndoerr_okr] through the evangelism work where he pushed the movement further inside Google, and later engaged wider audiences with the initiative entitled *What Matters* [^foonote_whatmatters_site] starting with the book entitled *Measure What Matters*, where the discussion continues to evolve. Visiting these resources will give you a view of the size and reach of the movement which is occupied with evolving the framework and ideas about goals and management of goals through real experimentation. 

[^footnote_johndoerr_okr]: John Doerr, a renowned venture capitalist, has been an advocate for the framework of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) which he discusses in his book *Measure What Matters*. He learned much about that directly from Andy Grove during his time at Intel. 

[^foonote_whatmatters_site]: The "What Matters" web site, accessible through https://www.whatmatters.com/, is part of an initiative that gained popularity with the book from John Doerr "Measure What Matters," which promotes Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) as a goal-setting framework that helps organizations define and track objectives and outcomes. 

As said by John Doerr in Measure What Matters, much before it was widely know, his early movement to push at Google started from his motivations that he saw smart engineers working in magical ideas but as the company started to grow they would need a system to organize how to get things done, or as John would say how to focus on what matters. Thus, the development of OKR inside Google added strenght to form OKR, to grow its principles in ways that smart engineers from top-tier Silicon Valley firms would not dismiss: 

> *""* John Doerr, Measure What Matters 

Beyond that, or before that, OKR has origins with the teachings of Andy Grove while he was the CEO of intel and an educator championing the approach under the idea of MBO or Management by Objectives. John had the opportunity to learn directly from Andy Grove. I think that John fell in love with the vision and challenge where Andy - as an educator and manager - wanted MBO to be used inside of Intel to help his colleagues in planning after working; so that they could later *determine* the *decisions* to set the company in the direction of a better future. But to so that, of course, he needed a simple system to allow work to be done, the minimal unit for getting things done, to exist in the first place. Only after that celebration that any further analysis could happen. This is why Andy had to use a very simple set of questions about the work being done to start with:  

> *"A successful MBO system needs only to answer two questions. One, where do I want to go? The answer provides the objective. Two, how will I pace myself to see if I'm getting there? The answer gives us milestones or key results."* (Grove, A., 2015, pp. 111)

<!-- 
@meta @references
* reference - Grove, A. (2015). High Output Management. Vintage Books.
--> 

In other words, Andy needed first a responsible system with a fundamental element that granted permission to work to happen, and to happen transparently, without a critical system to attack the work being done while being done. For example, as I am writing this paragraph I am going for a specific milestone: to complete an initial editing of the draft of this chapter by the end of this week. Such milestone is helping me to focus, to work. With that I am trying to not be too critical as if I get distracted with that I can put the actual milestone in danger. Naturally, my goals expect a future version of this chapter to be useful to the reader. But that has to be a different milestone in the future; granted that will expect an other more formal editing effort to take place. It is my hope that this work of now appears in the end - and while it remains to be seen - but to be concerned with that it would be a waste of time right now. In other words, I am working and I know that even if this goes away and gets removed that should be possible because of further clarity achieved because of this work; therefore, this milestone is necessary, therefore my work of now is valid, therefore I am necessary just like I am being myself now.   

We will come back to the challenges of reviewing key results and objectives and the conversation about OKR from the perspective of learning and replanning. For now, I want to highlight that this component, that makes work possible and visible and concrete and measurable, is what gives the doer the opportunity to, first, to get involved if they feel they can join the boat, and if so to know what they have to do, through these milestones or key results. 

I have no doubt of an optimistic and humaninistic perspective in that component of MBO because it holds the allowance to work and also it allows the work to be seen. And naturally other humanistic perspectives will be equally necessary for progress to happen - or the whole OKR system to work well - which we will discuss ahead. But the point being is that Andy were concerned with enabling his colleagues to work and talk about what they were doing and that would not be possible if they didn't have a way to look into what is being done. This is also the right time to acknowledge the challenges that Intel went through when the company's leading position as a memory chip manufacturer were surprised by what Andy called "a 10x force" [^footnote_onlytheparanoidsurvive_intel] provided by the competition from Japanese memory chip manufacturers that had better technology which would likely sink Intel especially if Intel kept following strictly its long-term objectives. 

[^footnote_onlytheparanoidsurvive_intel]: Andy Grove's "Only the Paranoid Survive" discusses the concept of a 10x force as a significant change that it changes the fundamental dynamics of a business or industry. Grove elaborates on how Intel's need for adaptability in business.

@meta @outline 
* Outline - answer k1.2.3 - Leadership in tops-down has to do with team's goal and not a bad critic 
--> 





By showing these aspects of the challenges of these managers, we can build a sense of values that were bundled and helped to shape the principles of OKR. Given what it was said, OKR starts - yes -  with the need for tops-down goals that can be accomplished and also can be quite ambitious: 

> *"An effective goal setting system starts with disciplined thinking at the top, with leaders who invest the time and energy to choose what counts."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)

The point is a great opportunity for us to consider that such idea of a 'disciplined thinking' done by a role of a leader has less to do any notion of any superior entity - like a boss that passes on what has to be done to subordinates ordering them to follow strictly like barbarians would ask. The point being does justice for the actual job of the leader to engage with such disciplined in the first place - an element which is necessary to guide any team even being that one person. In *Seven Habits of Highly Effective People*, Stephen Covey help us to see how that management works starts to build clarity:  

> *"Effective management is putting things first. While leadership decides what 'first things' are, it is management that puts them first, day-by-day, moment-by-moment. Management is discipline, carrying it out. "* (Covey, Stephen., 1989, p.148)

In other words, if we look at what to do and we happen to see people, and likewise the complexities with their communication such as subjective and variable communications that happens to be outstanding because they seem to know how get things done [^footnote_nightgale_outcomes], that should not confuse us about the essential point that goals - and clarity of goals - comes from the actual work of management of a role, or an entity, that uses a tops-down goal definition system as a communication system that sets upfront - as opposed to surprise people with what to do - and by that it proposes the objectives that prompt us to the actual work, or steps, which in conformance with our line of thinking, that are expected to be accomplished by measurable milestones, or key results.  

[^footnote_nightgale_outcomes]: Jonathan Nightingale had recognized, in *How Fucked Up Is Your Management*, that outcomes still matter (2017, p. 171). We went on to recognize that if everyone is measured by effort mainly is not great. With that, he recognizes that, in the end, "every company needs a set of folks who do understand the context, who can be held accountable for the right things actually getting done."

#### OKR on upfront goals and the mission or strategy

One will wonder if OKR would be a kind of system that happen to only be applicable after a giant machine - that knows where it is going - is moving; because generally the idea of setting tops-down goals and knowing things upfront carry some pressure in terms of a strict need to follow and to honor that plan and investment. And that is likely valid, to a certain extent, otherwise it would be like writing it down arbitrary moves which would likely confuse the doers. Still, that is why it is challenging anyway - and this involves certainly excitement and stress to a certain extent. Therefore, whoever mobilizes any effort has a degree of power, even if this starts with the work of a solo person. Given that challenging situation, it is still the sort of work that takes things out of the head of the leader that decides to do something that later becomes a startup. It gotta be something big enough to mobilize the effort anyway. 

But in the light of OKR, and given the growth demands of the startup situation, these leaders are asked to write in down and that in itself is an act of courage. No one is asking to waste time, such as to keep writing too much in ways that makes no sense and causes the doer to be doing nothing. The idea is that what is upfront planned is the upfront written and that gets to be what is upfront said which helps with the actual developments, the doing it in the first place in alignment with some of the ideas we have considered by now. These organizational aspects in OKR resonates with some of the following elements: 

* Putting things upfront is less about surprises - the exercise of doing it upfront demands courage and permission, or allowance. You may not know where you are going yet but you have to deal with it and to put it out. This process is what will help you and your team to understand that it is okay say upfront. As you put it out you are then granting permission to change too and you are going to - over time - to get you know and you and your team will get better in abstracting and conceptualizing after prior upfront developments happened. This is the opposite of making yourself and your team comfortable with surprises and arbitrary movements. 

* Formal team communications and clarity of priorities - even if you are alone but willing to move on with a team, the act of writing it down, and reviewing it, and coming up with statements that humans can read; will help you to read better, and to review it, also with others. With that, you are improving your team communications, you are developing a model that also disconnects the hidden thoughts of one or another - as you are setting an example - and therefore improves transparency. If something has to be improved, is the writing. Roles happen to be working on those things. 

* Craft a north star, the inspiring mission - it is okay to acknowledge what is there already, that we are after something that makes us feel incredible if that thing happened to be happen. But if not, it makes a lot of sense to have an idea for what future looks like. The very exercise of coming up with your north star will give you and your team a north to start. When this exists, it gives inspiration, and motivation, and from that the specific exercises of setting the work to do and expectations follows from. 

As you will see in the next section, these tops-down formalities will help with the initial design of the specific OKR plans - the more specific expections for what to do and why it matters - which  will involve the practice of revisiting frequently. In other words, expect that the tops-down design to not only influence but to facilitate the design of things to do and what to focus, to help with the break-down. A note from where we are. So far, there is nothing in the OKR, from these criteria for starting with the tops-down, that sets the whole ship to miss the need to understand what is going on, or to ignore the vital force of the doers which is essentially the role that does it and by doing so the role that discovers the need to change - we will get there.

Managers know that doers' real contribution rises from the doing - from the action - and it is influenced by how they do and why they do and therefore their state of well-being which supports their creative state. Or they get to know that over time as it is inescapable. Therefore, the perspective of the doers enters management, even if by fragments of what happens from the office of their psychologists, because it enters the workplace and because it impacts the organization's productivity. Peter Drucker, in Managing Oneself, portraits frames of the big movie and how the what is told is provoked with the what's happening:

> *"Throughout history, the great majority of people never had to ask the question, What should I contribute? They were told what to contribute, and their tasks were dictated either by the work itself - as it was for the peasant or artisan - or by a master or a mistress - as it was for domestic servants. And until very recently, it was taken for granted that most people were subordinates who did as they were told. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, the new knowledge workers (the so-called organization men) looked to their company's personnel department to plan their careers. 
> Then, in the late 1960s, no one wanted to be told what to do any longer. Young men and women began to ask, What do I want to do? And what they heard was that the way to contribute was "to do your own thing." But this solution was as wrong as the organization men's had been. Very few of the people who believed that doing one's own thing would lead to contribution, self-fulfillment, and success achieved any of the three."* (Drucker, Peter. 2008. pp. 35)

And goes on into a more enlightened view that the management of the self gains space, and consciousness, as the work place evolves. The modern doer is there, more aware of their development. They are alive and they react more. The following three elements of from the anyone working in an organization isn't a duty given by a manager but a way for the actual contributor to look at what they do there:

Now, if that role of the doer is alive and if OKR something to say about that is it so as a consequence of the very real frame of work that brought OKR. From the perspective of evangelism, John Doerr popularized it at Google and through the *Measure What Matters* but of course by checking its own usage and from its past experience by Andy Grove as he worked at Intel and learned about management by objectives directly from Andy. In addition, Andy has credited that he improved his views of management by objectives from Peter Drucker.

> *""* Andy Grove (Andy on Peter, from High Output Management)

All that to give us a view that OKR has strong points because of the interest if we want to make it real and strong and meaningful and if we are interested in improving it from the actual experience of doing it; and recognizing the changes that happens. Therefore, it is not unwise to consider that the willingness for one to contribute, in an organization, has ties with the effort to manage oneself. It's everywhere how OKR carries the viewpoint of the doer: 

> *"Leaders must get across the *why* as much as the *what*. Their people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)

Now if people to join projects, with causes and goals, they do because they know their strenghts can be used for the situation that needs to be changed. This is the premise necessary such as when one accepts to join the boat and even if they don't know, still it is by knowing what is ahead that they organize themselves to learn. You as a leader holds the position of responsibility where you have to be clear to start first pulling out from your head. This is what your team is dying to know [^foonote_michaeldearing_clarityteam] and this is a great first show of respect for your team - even if you have a too bold strong vision this is how any professional conversation starts.

--> 

#### The fight between the selfish and the non-selfish 




Before we move into the next section - the aspects of course-correction - it is worth to go back to an illustration of a fight and into an extrapolation of a generally assumed fight or source of anxiety between the tops-down things to do, protagonized through a historically a harsh bossy entity -  versus the bottoms-up effort of a doer that struggles under the relatinship and pressures of being a subordinate. Indeed, the tops-down, boss or manager or superior or an entity, appears to provoke a fight, indeed, with the bottoms-up role, the doer, the contributor, the effort maker. As if if one were the one that tells and on the other side the one that listen, and it is required to do and in the toxic condition is measured not by the effort but by the necessity to solve and achieve the outcome. This is then a source of anxiety where the doer suffers in many situations, such as anxiety or producing their tears as a by-product. 

But if these sides show a fight - by the photos we have taken of the workplace especially if we go back through history taking notes from the toxic organizations - we should use our time to pass through that hard wall and access an inner fight, or challenge, that really gets to feed that fire of the corporations that had created a lot of confusion to us. What is ahead, or under all that fire reveals an essential and struggle of a learning process when the doer is required to change, and by that a management process is required for enabling the new, the outcome, to be brought and change the system.  

Consider a micro context like a small team or even friends working, and even the micro context of an individual involved in the challenge to achieve an objective that is not easy. This is the fight that one deals with when they want to lose weight, or to learn to write, or to writer better, or to come up with an invention when the materials were not invented yet, or seeking some kind of freedom in the situation when the rules don't allow yet. When we lock in this situation - not by looking to any role of a bad person - we are required to recognize that achieving them goals will be hard, like it or not; and with that that we as managers have to face the reality for nurturing an environment for them to be achieved because the doer can only do one thing - to contribute - if they are onto it and involved and care. 




<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k1.3.2.1 - Management and grove on nurturing and supporting the surrender of the self for the team 
--> 




To celebrate a few OKR inputs up to this point - we should remember that OKR had asked us to have goals that are meaningful. As for the contributor, that there is an assumed inclination from the whole system that sought help and this doer, an interest in seeking what should be my contribution - which does not give up his values but recognizes the doer's weaknesses and strenghts. This relationship reveals two sides, the tops-down and the bottoms-up, or two personalities if you will where one being the doer that can be hold aspects of an apprentice and of an experts in various degree plus this doer can be also sensitive and innocent and generally feels good or hurt. On the other side, it is configured the personality of a critic or a judge or an editor that expects results, as a representative of the goals, a stakeholder. Our goal, as managers in the situation, has to do with the ability to look at what happens and reflecting so that we can help with what matters. Thus, we shall continue to check and nurture the conversation - like the OKR one - so that it can tell us how we can do our best, especailly that we may not know what to do and that furthermore the actual goals and therefore the ideas for how to get there aren't fully clear. Andy Grove came up with a viewpoint that recognizes the whole body work and the implication of it being that a system should exist that asks the individuals to do for the team: 

> *"To make such a body work requires the *voluntary surrender of individual decision making to the group*. Being a member means you no longer have complete freedom of individual action, because you must go along with the decisions of your peers in most instances. By analogy, think of yourself as one of a couple who decides to take a vacation with another couple. You know that if you go together, you will not be free to do exactly what you want to do when you want to do it, but you go together anyway because you have more fun, even while you'll have less freedom. At work, surrendering individual decision-making depends on trusting the soundness of actions taken by your group of peers."* (Grove, A., 2015, pp. 134-135)

<!--

--> 

In alignment with that, an enlightened view from Abraham Maslow gives us light into a a key aspect of "the fight" by considering that the doer is selfish and also the acknowledgement that her ability to perform, and to work, and to be embraced, shall lead her into accessing - if the environment is favorable - the non-selfish which is essentially to embrace adaptation: 

> *"This is an easy medicine for self-esteem: Become part of something important. Be able to say, "We of the United Nations . . ." or "We physicians . . ." When you can say, "We psychologists have proven that . . ." you thereby participate in the glory, the pleasure, and the pride of all psychologists any place. 
> This identification with important causes, or important jobs, this identifying with them and taking them into the self thereby enlarging the self and making it important, this is a way of overcoming also actual existential human shortcomings e.g., shortcomings in I.Q, in talent, in skill, etc. For instance, science is a social institution, with division of labor and colleaguehood *and* exploitation of characterological differences - this is a technique for making uncreative people creative, for making unintelligent men to be intelligent, for enabling small men to be big, for permitting limited men to be eternal and cosmic."* (Maslow, Abraham H., 1998, pp. 11-12)

<!--

--> 

This, of course, requires or goes along with a degree of a healthy, or enlighted condition, where the challenges of work are not affecting the doer's healthy condition to work and then it becomes the space for growth self and with that the expected growth of the work. 

Now, considering the possibility of a peaceful space between the role of the "one" that holds and expects the tops-down needs, now not being against the role of the contributor - the one that wants to contribute - the management of this health dynamics is not only the right thing to do - it's the necessary thing to do and the main thing to do. But also, when better explored or studied, such as under a calmer reflection, one will realize that this is the space where opportunity arises. That idea also goes along not only with the necessity for supporting the role of the doer but to support the role of the tops-down role that didn't have a full clarity and likely had phrased the tops-down goals - or for the matter where are we going - with limitations; which reveals the opportunity to let the actual work of the contributor role - individual or unit - to help with the discovery of clarity which will then help to course-correct the path. Let's move on to see how that opportunity to course-correct goals happens and how OKR offers a great deal of support to that.

## Course-correcting decisions for ambitious goals 






When it comes to translating objectives into actions - thinking that we started from the wishes and having entered the tops-down modeling effort after the higher-order goals - there is a natural and optimistic expectation - and purpose - for this modeling phase as a planning process to find things we can do that brings the objectives closer. 

With that said, you may remember what I have briefly introduced Andy Grove's intentions to put MBO in place as a practical system to help his colleagues in the planning by working although intended to help them to "*determine* the *decisions* to set the company in the direction of a better future," which goes inline with Andy's observation that "the true output of the planning process is the set of tasks that cause to be implemented." (Grove, A., 2015, p. 109)

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* reference - Grove, A. (2015). High Output Management. Vintage Books.
-->

But keeping that in hindsight, it still remains a challenging situation for the doers to be practical. And this is where we should - again - celebrate the simplicity in Andy Grove's two questions (2015, pp.111) from the management by objectives where the first answer "provides the objective," and the second "gives us milestones or key results:

* "Where do I want to go?" 
* "How will I pace myself to see if I'm getting there?" 

<!-- 
@meta @references
* reference - Grove, A. (2015). High Output Management. Vintage Books.
--> 

This second question is the birthplace of *Key Results*, or the milestones, which in alignment with great OKR thinkers [^footnote_okr_timebound] and set us to make them to be time-bound and to be clear - not ambiguous - for us and our colleagues. In other words, there is no doubt that OKR aims for achieving the objectives by having the objectives writen down and static and by having the key results written down and static. Yes, as I have said, that demands courage such as the courage to be wrong and to allow failure to happen - it's necessary. 

[^footnote_okr_timebound]: From the conversations about Key Results, both 'High Output Management' by Andrew S. Grove (2015) and 'Measure What Matters' by John Doerr (2018) align with Michael Dearing's General Management 2 course - https://www.harrisonmetal.com/classes/gm2-setting-goals-measuring-performance/lessons/magic-of-okrs - where Key Results need to be measurable and time-bound.

* Outline - Answer k2.0.1 - complication - Goal-setting fails to re-evaluate objectives under low self-esteem whole
--> 




We shall then proceed to celebrate a natural question, or a complication with that idea, which is that it pulls the doer - the individual or the team working - towards being locked by the following the key results, which indeed could cause anxiety under circumstances when the performer feels that things are not going well in the future. Worse it is when, in the face of the feeling that things are not going well, the performer is pressured to work even more towards pre-defined key results, as if assuming that more effort would save the strategy. Along with that idea, we shall well celebrate a view of the horizon pointed out in the complication given to us by David and Jason, who stated: 

> *"the sooner you admit you have no idea what the world will look like in five years, three years, or even one year, the sooner you will be able to move forward without the fear of making the wrong big decision years in advance."* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33).

Indeed, when working in the path of uncertainty and seeking out to come up with innovative solutions - the situation of startups - in a world that changes fast, that sounds about right that it could be the situation that many founders live by. It might come a situation of conflict when the findings along the way pulls the team to reconsider what is going on while they they feel that they cannot change direction, that they cannot be creative. The situation if pushed further generates confusion such as the essential conflict with the question of Peter Drucker: how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?

That is why OKR sounds complex but it is the beauty of OKR too. OKR accepts things to be done, as written. OKR accepts that what was done may not pull the objective closer. OKR does not want the doer to be fired, or out of the loop, under these situations. OKR recognizes that these situations are just part of working and are the reasons why we work. In other words, OKR goes well with the view from Andy (2015, p. 102) that "planning is an ordinary everyday activity; it's something all of us do all the time with no fanfare, in both our personal and professional lives."

#### OKR on non-ambiguous and strategic flexibility of objectives  






Therefore, it is justifiable to question if OKR has mechanisms in place that support teams to evaluate and course-correct what they do, as they go. The short answer to that is that that is why OKR is for. But as a longer one, OKR exists to help with pulling the objectives closer after the fact that the doing of it allow further reflection and evaluation. In other words, nothing can be improved if you don't know what you are doing - through the Key Results. But when you know it, it creates an opportunity for objectives to be evaluated, and then as a new iteration happens, new Objectives and Key Results to be designed. To give you an idea of cadence, it may be the case that the analysis of key results happens in terms of weeks; but keep in mind that the cadence of reviewing the KRs and the Os have a lot to do with the variability and learnings that the activity demands. As an example, if you set yourself to build a wall to your house, and you know that the challenge is pretty straight, it makes sense to not bother much with the reflecting and reconsidering the KRs since you can sense that the steps in to achieve the KR as expected are properly pulling your objective closer. But of course, with more ambitious key results, and the potential variability of internal movements - from the effort put in place - the analysis of Key Results can be benefited from a specific and strategic cadence. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.4  - answer - 
--> 

But again, and back to the point of this section - the point being is that OKR has to supports the possibility that objectives and the key results were not well designed given the actual north that we are after. Just keep in mind that not knowing exactly the future can be interpreted as an opportunity which should not be confused with writing poorly the objectives and key results such as in ways like being unrealistic or ambiguous. The key to help doers from a potential bad direction - and under the optimistic view to achieving a great and promising future - lies in nurturing the work that allow them to essentially transcend from the actual execution being done.

Accordinng to What Matters, there are different kinds of objectives that in essence demand different attitudes. 

* Committed - 
* Aspirational - 
* Learning -

The complication with choosing the right kind of objective - defining the attitude - is essentially the opportunity to be strategic given the where we are and where we want to go. Consider the following illustration given by Billy Casey (2024) in Dear *Andy: "Lights On" OKRs* of a restaurant chef that struggling under the pressure of coming up with aspirational and motivational OKRs:

```
Dear Andy,

My partners and I are currently in the process of opening a new restaurant in NYC’s West Village (fingers crossed we’ll be able fully open by late summer), and I want to create OKRs for my team to keep us focused and motivated. We have our company-wide Objective: Be a second home for the people in our neighborhood. We’ve also recently figured out our mandatory financial benchmarks we need to meet to pay the bills (X amount in profit, keep labor under X%, etc.). I know OKRs are supposed to be aspirational and motivational, but is it a good idea to include the “keep the lights on” goals somewhere in there, too?

Chef Claire
```

A great first point from Andy had recognized that the idea as valid under the assumption that it means what matters to the team; which is about celebrating that it moves the needle: 

```
Goals like “keep the lights on,” or, to be a little cheeky, “don’t run out of money,” would be considered committed OKRS (the things that must be achieved). You can absolutely include these types of revenue based goals in your OKRs — as long as you’ve decided that’s what matters most.
```

And Andy goes on to make the point that the accomplishment of that objective - in the situation of success - will likely bring them into the opportunity to move on, to keep moving the needle further: 

```
Once you’ve got your system locked into place and your restaurant is running like a well-oiled machine, you can file that OKR under “business as usual” and shift your focus on growth opportunities. 
```

This example shows how these attitudes go well together and that it can be harmonious.

#### OKR on needs for courage for transparency 


Consider an OKR that started with an initial objective, such as an objective that was created ahead of any work, such as one that comes from a mission or a vision. It does so with the purpose of pushing the design process of OKR into the modelling, or planning, for the steps that are thought to be steps that pulls the objective closer. 

This part, the Key Results part of OKR, appears first as a mechanism to keep track, that adds transparency, and which reveals what is being done and what is ahead. In additin, it is also a mechanism that offers a window of opportunity to see what goes on and how what is being done connects with where we want to go. Here is where OKR starts to get complicated as, in essence, it's becomes a collaboration mechanism. What I mean by complicated is that much more simpler to simply use OKR for tracking, as in a stream that goes to one direction, than for enabling it as a collaborative communication tool that allows teams to evaluate what they do, to change what they are tracking, if not to chage what they are going after. 





<!--

* Outline - Answer k2.1.1 - Collaboration - Example - Case of a book writing, the goal and the doing it. 
--> 




Through a case of a writer's situation - which may apparently look like a non-collaborative effort of a solo person - we can better see how the mechanics of using key results can be powerful a transparent and honest work effort of doing things, when supported by the right environment, can lead to greater impact - which in the case of the writer is to have the book published in order to help his audience. With that, we will be celebrating how the upfront writing is necessary, or daring if you will, and how the accomodation of key results sets the doer in the direction of progress.

From the following situation which I used as an example in the section about leadership:  

> *"For example, as I am writing this paragraph I am going for a specific milestone: to complete an initial editing of the draft of this chapter by the end of this week. Such milestone is helping me to focus, to work. With that I am trying to not be too critical as if I get distracted with that I can put the actual milestone in danger. Naturally, my goals expect a future version of this chapter to be useful to the reader."* Marcio Galli (2024)

Consider an initial note where this writer pinned in wall with a top label "Have a great chapter about how to progress with goals" which is part of this higher order goal of having his book published to help the startup audience with a more conscious execution. From the general situation, he expected to deliver pages, and pages into chapters, and a lot of other processes to pull the ambitious goals closer. At any point in time, his OKR had to had key results that he believed could be helpful. A note here is that OKR as a framework can't give him or you or anyone the actual strategy such as to judge  [^footnote_michaeldearing_judging_examples] the key results. 

He had then consider a prime key result as "To write down the whole sections to comply with the current chapter's outline," by the a given date with a reminder for him, necessary under the time-bound condition, that he would not be engaging in reviewing it or judging it and would even allow potential naive writing to happpen that would likely bring about elements of a poor writing.  Therefore, it could be seen that his KR had some nuances like of keeping the score but he knows that it has nothing to do with the grading or judging; and that has more to do with allowing the work to flow. As an example, the write had read a nuanced interpretation from Julia Cameron and allowed himself to not worry about grammar when doing initial draft works. With that, he had considered that the KR of delivering pages to be quite valid. With that, he had set himself into the window of opportunity which is to let the work to happen, and then from the key results accomplished, openning the opportunity for the later reflection. In other words, under the OKR expectations and with the communication going on, he would then be able to do the evaluation cycle and come up with a new OKR for a next cycle. 

[^footnote_michaeldearing_judging_examples]: From GM2 course from Harrison Metal, a real OKR of a highly technical founder was shown with the objective as "Understand the business side of our company so I can be a better founder," and his top KR to "Analyze two customers product use per week and write notes." Michael had noted, in case we find ourselves trying to judging it, that "it is his list, not yours," point being that the judgement of what ambitious means has to do with what matters to the doers.

Altough the example seem to be of a lonely writing, it reveals a collaborative aspect of OKR that is used by organizations that reportedly does well. Consider how individuals can take advantage of posting their OKRs, of sharing it. If we come to realize that this situation takes a great culture and effort, and by that that they enjoy the benefits of a virtuous collaborations such as colleagueship where people are helping each other, then, in essence, we're noticing and valuing that we need to see what's being done in the first place, and that's the primary movement that is necessary which deserves a lot of caring and nurturing.




<!--

* Outline - Answer k2.1.2 - Collaboration - Example - Case of a book writing, the editor-critic.
--> 




Now the writer had done it and even noticed that his effort in allowing a time-bound and safe work, such as of pushing out words as fast as possible and letting thoughts to come about; had pushed him to achieve clarity in terms of what he wanted to think. As he had completed the work, he felt a need to modify things, to come up with new things to do, such as to review the outline. At this stage, he had then engaged in the new version of his OKR with specific KRs where one of them required him, under a time-bound situation, to "read the content and annotate keywords and interesting phrases," and another "to consider editing the outline," so that the whole chapter improved in terms of coherence. And after he did that he would then move towards other opportunities to version his OKRs. Notice that he had to assume a certain personality to keep the process safe, such as to hold on and supress his willingness to be critisizing his own writing in realtime. 

Therefore, and I know that I asking you to be flexible here with me, a collaborative process rises from this apparently solo situation, especially if we consider that the human side of the doer - that judges it and that edits it and that were a holder of the tops-down things to do - wanted to be critically working on top of the human side that needed to write. The nuanced understanding of the whole situation of the doer that had to to align with the team's purpose - to complete the chapter - required the separation of the processes, and required the critic editor to step back. When the critic was on the side, and waiting, and the KR were about allowing pages to happen, the young writer spirit  of the doer was activated and he were able to write with the worse English if that was the case and to let all his ideas to flow and to let his innocence to happen through the writing. He were so happy doing that that he even started to like the critic editor. That OKR, in essence and under the view of a collaborative situation, became the contract that allowed the young writer to do his job. And then, ahead, the young writer happened to get the review from the critic editor, and so on.

In other words, the output of the planning process is the *decisions* made and the *actions* taken as a result of the process."* (Grove, A., 2015, p. 109)

BUt likewise with the concerns, these are there in ways that the doer is real, a contributor, and not following blindly. The opportunity is for understanding the best work possible and also reading from the data, the real information that is applicable to the context. In the view of Andy the meetings with the managers are the key aspect where the doer is the owner and the manager is there to help: 

> *""* Andy Grove, High Output Management 

Andy Grove elaborates on the aspects of the strategic management that arises from the actual involvement, the actual work. As an example, the opportunity lies in the identification of "both effect and counter-effect." This in essence has to do with checking the impact or the cost of the impact or the like against the higher order objectives or the bolder and ambitious goals in the view of the transcendence, which does not disconnect from the considerations about the self versus the non-selfish we have seen. 
As an example, a prior situation of an indicator could involve the doer to be attached and see the indicator as "my precious" in a given moment in time. 

As an illustration, consider the case of Harriet Tubman which I will add some elements of fiction but of course to make a point following from the actual values and virtues of her historic and brave heroic life. From the history of Harriet, she were able to escape the enslaved condition and by that she had achieved practical freedom to a certain degree. And she had achieved that as she had used her skills and following her aspirations. But connected with that, she had other aspirations and ambitions for freeing the others. Naturally, she had the idea of starting with her friends and people that she loved which you can confirm that by watching Michael's talk (2018) or the movie [^footnote_harriet]. 

[^footnote_harriet]: Spoiler alert - The following content contains spoilers for the movie 'Harriet.' In the film, after successfully escaping, Harriet Tubman's story notably includes her profound desire to free her friends and family.

And according to Michael Dearing, Harriet had to come up with new strategies, or to scale her operation or model; to make that work because she wouldn't be able to just free all the slaves all of the sudden using the same sort of key results, or methods that she were using in the beginning. She could, for example, dream about scaling if we were writing a private letter to herself; but even if she did it would not achieve results if not she would end up in more trouble by the existance of the letter. Therefore, and under the circumstances of the relative success that she had, which is actually too big as a relative because that was the prime movement for the opportunities for scaling; Harriet had to face the challenges and transcend and accept the non-selfish aspects involved in being rigorous or strict with the same approach of guiding small groups of people through the woods. In other words, and as she had achieved her milestones and new knowledge, she had to organize herself, to change herself, to adapt and to transcend from attachments with the prior attitudes; in order to get there and to free a lot more people later. In essence, she moved from helping herself to being a conductor and her key results reflected that too.

--> 






> ".................." 

When exposing what we do, the things we are doing, and letting others chime in to help, even people that are not connected directly, it is natural to consider that the mechanism promotes communication and open ideas to flow in which would result in an opportunity to reduce self bias and improve not only effectiveness, in the sense of performance for what is being done and in the sense of the simpler nature of accounting and tracking, but also taken that this simpler factor is present, the more complex collaborative communication which is the opportunity to evaluate all that is being done. 

Consider that the point about transparency and collaboration has to do not with the benefits like gambling, of one helping with the other, as if people have the clicks, that is a by-product of doing in a collaborative and transparency way. But in addition to that, it is important to recognize that transparency, having things written down, also reveals failure in the eyes of everyone, which could be complicated depending on the effects from the exposure of failure, such as if the protagonists of the failed propositions aren't to be valued. Therefore, in other words, the exposure goes along with the necessity of the right attitude, a system of protection which when exists gains a strategic meaning, as indicated by Michael Dearing, gains a tone of competition, a healthy competition: 

> *"It seems to me that the best product roadmaps come from vigorous internal competition for time and talent from engineering, design, marketing."* Michael Dearing (2016)

The point suggested by Micheal was isnpired from the general point about competition in macro markets (2016) - the situation and acknowledgement that competition drives better results with the rise of the winning competitor. But then, deriving from that, it comes the natural question if any of that is the actual mechanism we use when we come up with a better thing to do in the face of our goals. Perhaps Michael saw the whole world as a one big company which is the analogy for the intercal micro market and the notion of competition. In this model, consider that there is the input of doing, from doing, from vision, from brainstorming, first in the beginning of a process like a funnel. And then, a quantitative and qualitative judgement chimes in which separates the gold from the things that we can separate, as in the data to support recyling it. 

But a quite important aspect of it has to do with the need for transparency and exposure. "Put the roadmap where everyone can see it is one of the most powerful actions a founder can take." (2016) which goes along with " It is to be expected that people who care about what they work on are disappointed when something doesn’t work out the way they wanted. The approach above arms them with the information they need to make sense of the disappointment and to improve the probability that their next ideas will get funded." (2016)

Notice that in the illustration he created the idea of "funded" can be interpreted as approved or the general idea of buy-in.

The effort of redoing the OKR hundreds of times, is for the sake of being open. Now, in this regard, a question that comes is if OKR does not allow room for bottom-up contributions that affects the tops-down. Part of it I have covered, the conversation is there. But the cycle for reviewing all the top down plan exists too and bottom-up contributions is recognized as key. In other words, the approach needs and depends on the confrontation of the what we want to do with the what is happening. Of course, the cadence for that sort of strategic planning work might have a cadence, needs a cadence applicable to the organization.



The very process that Michael has suggested seems to go along well with the individual situation of a writer - so I this makes me comfortable to see a pattern and then to consider the situation of the individual being the same of the team; which may help us to achieve clarity of that the problem we have for achieving ambitious goals is always the problem of finding support and may also connects with high self-esteem. 

Consider the ideas from Jordan Peterson from his *Essay Writing Guide* [^footnote_jordanpeterson_essaywritingguide]. When all starts in the lifecycle of an essay, after she had chosen a topic and wants to go writing, he suggests that our inclination to "write trite, repetitive and cliché introductions and conclusions" are real. And he even acknowledges - under the view of supporting the work to happen - that it is "often useful" to *write* a stock introduction, such as "What is the purpose of this essay?" as part of the process which is to say that these elements will be later be thrown away.

A similar situation happens in the end of the process when it is time to edit paragraphs through a process that he uses that consists of creating two screens and comparing article A with a variation of it on the side. He goes on and illustrates that through his process he will be editing and literally testing different paragraphs til he finds one that is good and does justice to what he expects of the paragraphs according to the outline. According to Jordan: 

> *""* (Peterson, J., )

When I read Jordan illustrating this process "of the self" it was inescapable for me to see the role of a doer, a contributor, that were able to innocently try different things - such as a competing paragraph - in the attempt to match the objective, the ouline. In way, this goes well with the idea of a highly supportive environment for a writer to get to the point of, as pointed by Jordan if one goes towards the publishing, to let it go and remove 80% of the thoughts behind, under the achievement of more clarity. In other words, by keeping up and accepting the momentary injustice [^footnote_momentary_injustice], and keeping the innocence high and safety for healthy competition, we can advance and connect towards the objective, even to a point of transcending and understanding that the higher-order objective - such as an outline - has to change. By going through that, we go through change ourselves.

#### OKR on the non-creative work space 



Of course, depending on the culture, toxic aspects can come the way to influence the process to offer no value. For example, depending on how the measurement of performance of an employee is done, such as when the compensation is associated with the Key Results and moving towards the Objective as written, then the results can be catrastrofic. Would one want to course correct its path, after having good reasons for so, after knowing that she or he could be evaluated as bad performer and even get fired? That kind of situation would certainly bring anxiety and a lot of distractions for a call that would not likely happen. 

It's important to pause here and reflect that a lot of companies indeed entered that mode. They set goals in stone, they put prizes for the people that follow the path as written, and they punished the ones that didn't do well, that in other words, couldn't achieve those numbers expected, such as outcomes. So by doing that, the company, the organization, engages in the very same process where the king used to kill the messenger, because the messenger brought bad news. That's the reason for why key results are milestones. They need to have an association with the actual effort, and not exactly an association with the outcome it the notion of outcome is connected with the very thing that evalutes people. 

Then it comes the question, do they course correct? Yes but they do that in macro terms, by facing a crisis, which likely involve getting people fired, managers fired, teams reorganized. From the point of view of an employee, under a whole team that got fired for moving in the bad direction claiming it was good, the employee generally tries to escape the spiral of death by reclaiming that he was told to do that job and was performing well. In a lot of situations like that, a lot of people can get away. But still, anxiety was present and a lot of effort to manage the crisis which can and should be considered a bad use of the time of people. 

Therefore, it is ideal to think that a plan for progressing is not about a plan for evaluating people - as in to consider them in or out the boat. This is a key aspect of the OKR approach that when well considered can make OKR become a useful tool and one that also serves well for course-correcting and actually bringing everyone on board and focusing on what matters. 

With cadence for evaluating what's being done, with allowance for reviewing, with transparency and strategic thinking too, and with the subjectiveness and the judgment of the things being done, and as we shall remember Andrew Grove saying that, "but the MBO system cannot be run mechanically by a computer. The system requires judgment and common sense to set a hierarchy of objectives and the key results that support them. Both judgment and common sense are also required when using MBO to guide you in your work from one day to the next." (2015, pp. 114)

This approach that can help the people to change the plan at the level of key results and objectives is the very approach that recognizes that the effort is what matters in the first place, and along with the effort, the capacity to reflect on effort and actions, and by that of course, the true output of management by objectives rises, that is, to come up with decisions and actions.

## The battle of Outcome vs. Output  

There are situations that people enter the OKR train is valid, as it stops beautifully on time in the station. It’s a trip with a goal, such as to learn and use OKR in the best way possible. But then we enter in it, the wagon starts smooth and the scenery is beautiful, it’s unbelievable and the roadmap seem to make sense with scenes around. But then, give it some time and housing passing by. Suddenly the lights of the train blinks arbitrarily and we hear something craking as the speed of the train increases fast. A yellow light fades under the seat and people start to be worried. Next stop, unknown, the train enters a tunel, the heater stops working, and it goes on for another 2 hours with the speed increasing. What is next will blow your mind. You can't go back to revisit the trip. You are on it and it is going of the tracks. This is where you start to lose faith in your OKR trip and your training. 

The way that Christina Wodtke puts it in her article - entitled *"Are You Sure You Want to Use OKRs?"* I love it because the actual *Call to Action* calls for a reflection: 

> *"There is a concept I call drift. Drift means that a process has drifted away from the original framing. It happened to Agile. What started as a simple idea that people should work collaboratively and iteratively became people policing each other on the True Agile Way: “this is how to write a user story” and “Stand up can’t be more than 15 minutes long.”"* (Wodtke, 2022)

The complication that I had was that I have identified that OKR learning starts smooth but hits a wall at some point. Not sure if you have seen this but a lot of the OKR articles - and there is a lot of them now trying to help with problems, ambiguities, struggles - sort of gets a bit complicated at a specific point. Things get hard when the learner moves toward the shape/design/model of Key Results. The core of this learning complication, in my opinion, has its epicenter in the Output vs. Outcome discussion.

[1] When John Doerr (and team) launched Measure What Matters, I believe the fight was not there. However, with time, they published their positioning - What Matters: Output vs. outcome with OKRs. https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/outputs-vs-outcome-okr

[2] On the other hand, many product managers (which seems to be the case) are moving their troops using Outcome-oriented thinking. Christina Vodjke, the author of Radical Focus and Stanford Professor, has indicated that Outcome-oriented is better - https://cwodtke.medium.com/you-cant-handle-okrs-5465cf161e81

If you make a key result 'launch this feature' and halfway through the quarter you discover it won’t move the number you hoped it would, you’re stuck.

So I was stuck in my small world, preferring a bit towards Output/action, which gives me a way to judge/evaluate actual action strategy. But yet stuck anyway or unhappy with the complexity in the center of this fight, as I have figured. No articles seemed to address the Outcome vs. Output question in the context of management. Most of what I have found - through the actual "live conversations" of the middle-range articles which in reality are the voices of the crowds struggling with it - seemed to address the theme under the view - and accordinly the pressure - of getting things done which fortunately under the viewpoint of our journey to focus back and keep with the management view is a better use of our time.

* Change this - For OKR, my conclusion would be that the needle, to adjust towards output-based or outcome-based, would depend on what is delivered. For example, if the project in the hands of an individual is very design-oriented where the executor is learning/discovering/stepping into the unknown (old or young), they might consider it output-based. If the project has found direction, then an outcome-based can be handy.

To be fair with Christina, notice that the context may matter. In the above view, she had assummed what she referred as "prep work" which I would then relaltively agree with the idea of key results to have that inclination to outcomes, if you have indeed a crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency: 

> *"Do the prework. Make sure you have a crisp strategy. Make sure your teams have psychological safety. Make sure your product teams are multidisciplinary (Product, Design and Engineering.) Fire bad managers. Adopt Agile and Lean practices. Create as many self-sufficient teams as possible. Value effectiveness over efficiency."* (Wodtke, 2022)

[3] An article that helped me to see the two sides of the spectrum was this one from this guy named Josh Seiden - https://medium.com/@jseiden/to-write-better-okrs-use-outcomes-e82be6e7b460 as he included the cartoon image (Resources -> Activities -> Output -> Outcome -> Impact) which he attributes to "The Project Logic Model, adapted from Kellogg Foundation"

So up to here, I had identified the complication in the learning journey of a founder.Moving towards the potential answer, the following author gave us a cartoon to help us understand Output vs. Outcome, although he promotes Outcome-based for OKR:+ Cartoon is [Resouces -> Activites -> Output -> Outcome -> Impact]https://medium.com/@jseiden/to-write-better-okrs-use-outcomes-e82be6e7b460

The effect of the above writing (and similar thinking) has, IMHO, provoked What Matters folks to position a response:+ Output vs. outcome with OKRs -https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/outputs-vs-outcome-okr

The likely core of the worriness of Christina has to do with the struggle if you are interested in being open about the actual efforts you make. The point of her intention - in my view - has to do with "giving up" a potential challenging part of OKR - to see the output and discuss - and to allow the team to get away, to deal with it. And by the way, the point given in the following interview, she recomments a good brainstorming for the key results design:

#### Recovering the reflective opportunity - The window 

Adjusting Christina's approach to make it work with the output-based, would be about acknowledging first the good intentions in the good not the best: 

>*"The best is the enemy of the good. If you are spending weeks refining the language of the objective and pinning down just the right metrics, your company is in the business of process management. That’s wasteful. Try to make good OKRs but remember there is a time when you have to say, good enough for now. You don’t want to spend three weeks setting your goals and lose the time you could be working toward them instead." (Wodtke, 2022)

And isn't it the case that some
times, often or not so often when we have time, a saying says that "the angel lives in the details," or something like that. And there I felt in front of a quote which I have imagined the so many interpretations that were possible. To be fair, the context matters. But I feared anyway that an urgent reader-learner could miss the good in the details where she meant to say that we should not spend more time mostly refining our OKR and less time working. That is why I rather keep that quote outstanding but still to see how it could well be applicable to the situation - which I find quite important anyway - that involves the possibility of a doer that keeps on refining the language of the objective a lot in the best way possible:  

I believe that the OKR-friendly or the MBO-friendly for "refining the language of the objective" happens if the doer does this job after the fact that that output was done. Or more precisely, with key results achieved, after the action and effort put in place, the generated data, and the information, happens to support the doer to consider the reflection with the horizon in hindsight; thus aiming for the opportunity. This, in mathematical terms, would be about considering that the Refinement of the objective is a function of Key Results, RO = f ( KR ), where the achieved Key Results is a function of the Objective, KR = f ( O ). Therefore, New Key Results comes as a function of the work of refining the language of the objective, NKN = F ( RO ). With that, by the doing of it, there is then an alignment with Christina's idea of avoid the best and her intention to go straight to the good because indeed "the best is the enemy of the good." 

In other words, the judgement of the effort can only happen after the fact of a clearly stated effort given by the clearly acomplished Key Results. The opportunity for a good refining starts with, first, the observationof that has happened, and from that it follows a reflection of what is going on - such as through interactions of the team talking about it - which takes them to come up with with new ideas and concepts which likely forms the new cycle [^footnote_kolb_learning].

[^footnote_kolb_learning]: This viewpoint is given in alignment with *Kolb's Experiential Learning Model*, which emphasizes learning as a cyclical process of experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting. This model, according to the Wikipedia article (2024), consists of four stages: *Concrete Experience*, *Reflective Observation*, *Abstract Conceptualization*, and *Active Experimentation*.

--> 

The idea of using Key Results to quantity success can be dangerous because your objective - in the long run - is a better primary expected success. The Key Results, in an approach that is honestly collaborative shall then become the reference work that gives us the opportunity to re-evaluate. The danger of moving straight under the assumption of quantification of success is given by Key Results is that you can miss keep traking of what you are doing, missing the window of opportunity for evaluation, and in the case of weak cultures, this may also become doing things outside the window of what is visible and accountable which is where a lot of people are able to in a way or another get things done, however it is a bit inline with gambling or even to help build an organization where the things being done can't be discussed transparently. Plus, another price to pay but in alignment with our objective here is an inclination towards a disatisfaction with OKR in general; plus one would likely need other system (likely to be like OKR) to deal with the actual real actions and effort of the day.

The viewpoint given by Reforge is also mature to recognize not only the different kinds of key results but strategic mixing of these kinds to actually improve the deepthness of connection with the purpose, the objectives: 

> *"They come together to paint a picture of what needs to happen for your objective to be successful. .. There are output-metric key results — such as delivering an important feature — as well as outcome-oriented key results.

#### Clarity for effort vs. outcome using roles of junior vs. senior 

That shows a complex approach that some of the Mozilla managers had for measuring folks, where "junior people can be measured by effort" while "the outcome can measure senior people."The framing of this last article helped me see correlations with:+ junior/senior+ unknown/known+ divergence/convergence+ aspirational/commitment+ effort/outcomeAnd that helped me to see better that the adjustment of the needle (from action, to output, to outcome) could be done depending on the context of the objective.Therefore, if you don't know much about what you are doing, you can measure by effort and revisit faster (100 times). If you are confident, the measure could be oriented towards an outcome.That could also explain why composed OKR (team level) could be more oriented to outcomes and why an individual could be more oriented to effort. Not sure.

[4] Until today. When I was following the articles in order, you had your "/5" article referring to the "/29" article (Leadership is not about your good intentions / https://mfbt.ca/leadership-is-not-about-your-good-intentions-5e21666cb01b ) which has provoked my mind as I reached the following diagram:

* "Junior people we evaluate on effort."
* "Senior people we evaluate on outcomes."

The above blew my mind, my friends. A neuron in a galaxy far away was able to say hi to another neuron in another faraway galaxy.

But it wasn't only that, you kept, in this article, provoking my mind with things such as "who is junior" or "what means junior" or "why?"

Having had a light, I am here pondering one thing as I try to go back to Output vs. Outcome in the context of OKR. Besides the excellent spectrum provided by [3] Seid, this potential addition has to do with the visualization that effort might go along with design/divergent thinking on the one hand. In contrast, the outcome might go along with design/convergent.

As in - open vs. clone

As in - discover vs. execute

As in - aspirational vs. commitment

I do not know if my awakening has a significant flaw, but something seems linear here or structured about the problem.

> *"As you get more seasoned, your strategy is biased toward social and business problems instead of cognitive ones. You learn how to run a meeting and how to pre-flight the important decisions before that meeting even starts. . . "* (Nightingale, J., 2017, p.170)

##### Who is the junior? 

What matters, really, is that you can be just out of the sudden under a need to flip yourself, to embraced a personality, to model it, to consider the maturity level for that task. In other words, no matter how senior you are, you can be a junior at any time depending on your objectives ahead: 

> *"Holding a junior employee accountable for the success of the organization isn’t realistic. Without those strategies, they don’t know how to make success happen. So we substitute in productivity goals, progress goals. Are you writing clean code? Are you collaborating well?"* (Nightingale, 2017)

##### Rupture and maturity dissonance 

An outcome of setting a mature expectation to your now-junior doer is that you create a maturity dissonance which under the need to keep all strict as "this is the way" you bring about rupture to your working team - and moreover misses the point which is using the effort phase to bring about and to discover maturity: 

> *" When you’re new it’s hard to know the difference between a bad idea, a good idea with the wrong team, and a good team with a bad plan. It encourages people to be hair trigger and awful to each other as a way to seem smart. It encourages other people to leave."* (Nightingale, 2017)

##### The quest for the Holy Grail and interference of numbers 

We all know what we are after, it might even become a sacred as we get into the natural business of organizing ourselves, or to mobilize efforts and even rituals, when we are after that: The Holy Grail is an outcome in the end. That need is in all of us and it is the very reason that on many circumstances we will find our ways to cross that bridge since we shall not be afraid to answer any question if a gatekeeper requests it in the first place.

The possibility for dealing with those legitimate moments of struggle - where literally one could be catapulted out of the team situation - is to bounce back the question in ways that we check the validity and the absurdity of the whole situation. Leaving the bridge the the holy grail in the past but sticking with the truths of our corporate tales, it may be appropriate to celebrate the view from Jeff Bezoz given by Jason Child when he said that Jeff Bezos is famous for optimizing for the truth-seeking culture: 

> *"And he would get into business, and then we'd look at stuff, and then he would see things, and if looked really good or really bad, he turned to me and he says, 'Is this number right? And would you stake your career on it?'"* Jason Child (Greylock, 2017, 14:37)

Jason went on and added that the whole point of Jeff was to make sure that the analytics were not lying because, "you can lie with numbers very easily. You know, is a subscriber a customer? Is it including reactivation? Is it including, .. you know, there are so many ways you can make it say what you want it to say." Jason Child (Greylock, 2017, 14:37)

##### Outcomes matter 

> *"But outcomes still matter. The buck has to stop. I've seen companies that score everyone on effort, but I have never seen great companies that do so. Every company needs a set of folks who do understand the context, who can be held accountable for the right things actually getting done."* (Nightingale, J., 2017, p. 171)

##### Maturation models 

The model which we aim, which especially is the case for startups, is that the roles are dynamic. The "mature" corporate situation has the light for the solution. If you are mature enough to do that, it is then that you are positioning and understand that there is a way to actually push the outcome you want:

> *"Every company needs a set of folks who do understand the context. Who can be held accountable for the right things actually getting done. That’s what executives are for. You are the people who turn strategy into execution. It’s a hard job. It’s why you get a fancy title and a high salary and a team of people. You need to prioritize, spot problems early, adapt and adjust. You need to empower your teams to be creative, but never step so far away that you lose the thread of how they’ll get it done. "* (Nightingale, 2017)

This again aligns with the given "prep work" suggested by Christina, in my rewriting, the  "crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency." (Wodtke, 2022) 

#### If OKR is the roadmap then it's not evaluation of performance 

The idea of not being so hard is exactly about allowing the doer to fail with the key results and reevaluate which key results bring the doer "back into" the promising direction. Now for thre sake of solving the complex question - should I go with outcome or output - and given the point given, we may use, for the sake of the reflection, the advice from the professor of the MWM Course: 

> *"Contribution is not the same as “making your OKRs.” Did this person make smart choices and stay focused on moving the numbers? Did they gain traction? Did they learn what not to do? And not everyone can contribute to OKRs, so you will need something more than “making OKRs” to evaluate them on.*" (Wodtke, 2022)
