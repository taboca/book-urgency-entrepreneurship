When the entrepreneurial function happens to creatively destroy the old and change reality it does so more by getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone] and less because of theory, fiction, inventions, and other required arrangements to thrive. Focusing on the worker - call them doers, executors, entrepreneurs - right after they put their helmet on and set themselves in the trajectory, immediately they visualize that if they want to get things done back home they can't just be doing things, like getting arbitrary things done. In other words, the doers go far but they do so by calling ground control - by setting goals and incessantly fearing [^footnote_fears_drivers] of being drifters in the space of opportunities.

[^footnote_fears_drivers]: We have discussed in the first part how fears play a significant role in driving entrepreneurs, or the actual entrepreneur of their lives. We fear to fail, we fear to be wasting time, we fear to run out of gas or oxygen, and that fear can also set us to run quite fast even entering a fearless movement into action. 

[^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned  Austrian-American economist and political scientist known for his theories on economic development and business cycles, in "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," emphasizes the characterization of "getting things done" (p. 132) as an essential element of the entrepreneurial function. He argues this aspect is even more crucial than others, such as the entrepreneur's ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive.

Now, for any startup trying to exit from the arbitrary movement, a subject known as Management by Objectives will likely appear in their orbit either as an answer to be productive from a the philosophical needs or due to external needs, or the more practical needs, that follows as the team grows - more people, more differences, and therefore the pressure to figure how each one can contribute. To support that, consider that there are needs for clarity about top priorities by the team: In a survey [^foonote_michaeldearing_clearobjectives] with 250 people working in high-growth companies, 70% of them confirmed that to be clear about the company's top priorities is extremely important.

[^foonote_michaeldearing_clearobjectives]: Michael Dearing discusses the importance of understanding top priorities in high-growth companies in his course 'Self Study GM2: Setting Objectives & Measuring Performance.' In this course, Dearing surveyed 250 people working in high-growth companies about the clarity of top priorities and the quality of team management. He found that 70% of respondents confirmed that understanding top priorities was extremely important; plus the study showed a correlation between the quality of management and the clarity about top priorities.

> *"To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct economic function, first, because they lie outside routine tasks which everybody understands, and secondly, because the environment resists in many ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions with the enterprise exploit. It consists in getting things done."* (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

If that horizon rings a bell, it may not be entirely sufficient for the early or inexperienced doers to - let me put it that way - get distracted from the challenges of their day which feels like "jumping off a cliff trying to assemble an airplane on their way down," [^footnote_reidhoffman_airplane_cliff] as Reid Hoffman vividly reminds us. In other words, they do call ground control but they may do so in ways which they think are major such as to keep doing what needs to be done, first, and afterwards they come back to organize things like sorting out post-its [^footnote_michaeldearing_realdoing_postits] which may more or less lead to the required organizational work. 

[^footnote_reidhoffman_airplane_cliff]: In discussing the nature of startups, Reid Hoffman celebrates the metaphor where in the startup situation "you throw yourself off a cliff and you assemble an airplane on the way down," (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2013) to vividly note about the challenges such as the mortality situation and of focusing.

[^footnote_michaeldearing_realdoing_postits]: Harrison Metal illustrates - through the animation "Objectives & key results" [Harrison Metal, 2016] - brillantly how we generally deal with organization of goals with the situation of a business owner that starts with an initial aspiration, that gets involved with the day-to-day activities, and then engages in an effort to do the analysis in retrospect by generating ideas under the hope that sorting out post-its may improve its productivity which would innevitably leads to management by objectives, if done right.

--> 





Still, a complication remains that given the ongoing conversation of management by objectives is alive - that us managers of our real and concrete objectives of now, get to be busy with the getting things done, under the flag theme "how should I contribute best?" and living the pressures of the current. That reality pushes us to avoid the more formal involvement with the theme - as it sounds like a distraction, or the very waste of resources which is unproductive, in front of our desire to achieve the very goals. 

That set us to be uncomfortable with the theme - even to a point of doubting the applicability of any idea for managing goals and progress, or deferring to later as if it is something that can be used in the right time, such after more traction exists or the team is bigger. 

But really and to be fair, our inclination is not out of laziness or just the pure drive for results that puts the cart before the horses. We may have a lot of reasons to be mad and frustrated with a lot going on when we are running in the hallways of the staartup hypermarket through the aisles checking the cover of all that seem so coherent - given that all promotes to be the holy grail to our problems. We do read the small letters, and quite get involved with checking things in responsible ways such as when we ask for our colleagues or views from the critic. Consider the view by Fried and Hansson (2018, p. 32) - the renowed founders of the successful Silicon Valley firm Basecamp - in *Making it up as you go* for how they run their company by not following strong goals such as the 2, 3, or even 5-year plans:

> *"Every six weeks or so, we decide what we will be working on next. And that is the only plan we have. Anything further out is considered a 'maybe, we will see.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 32).

<!--

--> 

Furthermore, they give us a good argument for the situation where strong goals can be detrimental to progress: 

> *"Much corporate anxiety comes from the realization that the company has been doing the wrong thing, but it is too late to change the direction because of the 'Plan.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33)

<!--

--> 

There is truth in there - truth that will also guide us ahead - but for now I rather consider the complication of an inclination that based on these values builds up a positive logic that sums up - like an investment - where each day we may grow a principled view that this has to do with yet another management practice of the slow world of management which is simply not applicable to our situation. What we miss, in that the "no" we say to these themes are not only a "yes" to the things we want to get done. It is a yes to our own management solution since doing things happens anyway. A note from Jonathan Nightingale from *How Fucked Up Is Your Management* help us to see the dangers of the positive inclination that sometimes support us to dismiss management:  

> *"I don't need you to be the best in the world at management. But if you're not planning to be, if you're not going to be really studious and dedicated to it, then for God's sake stop messing with it. I promise you you can't build a better management system in your spare time."* (Nightingale, J., 2017, p. 23)

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Question Answer - Can we do something? Reflect from far, in perspective. 
--> 






So, here we set ourselves in a dilemma where we are engaged and concerned with productivity, to do our best towards our objectives, but equally concerned with the aspects when and why. In other words, is it worth to get involved with learning about goal-setting and goal management? And if so, when is the right time to engage in learning or the applicability of more formal methods or frameworks? 

The short answer for getting involved is *yes*, because you are already involved if you have objectives ahead - even if you are alone, and a lot involved and responsible if you are leading the team situation. In other words, you started it. Therefore, you are using the time and energy of your team and so you are in charge of a tremendous impact. Although brief, this view solves the question of when too; which set us to consider the how to navigate this time, or the how: 

What is ahead is an opportunity to reflect about the management of work given by goals. To honor that, I will assume that we are not into the pressure of having to map what to do, such as how things apply to our team in real-time, while you are learning. My hope is that we can reflect with a certain strategic distance, we should be able to take something with us for when the trip happen. But it may also be the case that we might take something practical for now for our lives and for our teams in a way that can be lasting. 

With that said, we will ride along with OKR - Objectives and Key Resources - which is a popular management framework for goal-setting and progressing with goals. In alignment to our strategy, our approach will have less to do with introducing the framework - or suggesting it like a playbook - and more with "consulting with OKR" or "checking with OKR conversations." My intention is that we can explore the subject and to join the rich conversation that OKR has given as we will see in the following sections. Since we don't want to set the carriage in front of the horses, let us start by honoring why OKR will be great to support the conversation. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Answer and strategy - Can OKR help with this conversation?
--> 

#### OKR as a rich conversation 

OKR, which I consider to be an strategic management approach, has originated in Silicon Valley at Intel Corporation. The system, or approach, became known as a framework and became widely used and discussed after its adoption at Google. In short, OKR has survived the test of time - and the potential objection from the collective intelligence by the workers [^footnote_marciogalli_people] from these Silicon Valley companies. It is fair to acknowledge the enormous amount of new people that have entered the conversation about management of goals inside and outside these organizations. An informal survey presented by Kris Duggan [^footnote_krisduggan_surveyokr] in *Using OKRs to Drive Results aka ‘Secrets to Crushing Your Goals’* gives us an idea of its popularity:

[^footnote_marciogalli_people]: Based on my experience at Netscape Communications in the early 2000s, our environment consisted of too many creative and intelligent individuals who happened to be developing the future of the Internet, to happened to be using the Internet tools to collaborate, and who happeneed to appear as chaotic by their involvement with the idea of break norms. 

[^footnote_krisduggan_surveyokr]: It is important to acknowledge Kris Duggan's deep involvement with OKRs. His company, BetterWorks, provides a tool for setting, tracking, and managing goals via OKRs; and has received investment from John Doerr, a prominent Silicon Valley investor and renowned evangelist of OKRs. 

> *"By the way, show of hands, who actually does OKRs right now? OK, about a third of you. And who's thinking about OKRs? OK, a third of you and then a third of you came for the free drinks and dinner, I guess. OKRs are simply a management methodology that helps companies focus their effort on what's important and to do that scales across the organization. I don't think you can be too small to think about OKRs. One or two people in a team, or a group, or a division, or a department, or a company, or up to literally 60, 80, 100 thousand people could do this at scale."* (Duggan, K., 2015)

As we move on with OKR, the good news is that we won't be riding on it while trying to learn how to ride and at the same time being concerned with the roadmap challenges. I say that because OKR can be seen as a temperamental animal where people try to control it, to tame it, and then they get confused, they fall, they get hurt; although this illustration isn't as sad as the possibility of them just being frustrated with OKR and giving up, even giving up the conversation about the challenges of goal-setting. By using OKR to the purposes of reflection, we will be considering things in perspective, we will set our focus on the actual underlying temperamental element - the human element - that makes goal-setting and the management of goals so hard. Jonathan Nightingale (2017) captures this sentiment well when he says that '[m]anaging people is exceptionally hard to do well. People are complex, and organizations are just full of them' (p. 23).

With that, our reflection will be more like talking the walk, with the intention to help us and our colleagues when we are required to go walk the walk or walk the talk in the domain of management of goals. Let us start by checking why is it that tops-down goals are important, and what OKR tells us about using  strong or ambitious or possibly long-term goals, and the considerations for dealing with goals when the road is uncertain. Moving on, we will check the how management of goals - and OKR along with it - deals with the need for course correction. As for the last section, we will consider the complexities for measuring and the judgment of progress and how the too radical perspective can influence the team's poor judgement.

--> 






Why is it that when a young worker enters an organization and finds tops-down goals to be so impactful? And I don't mean impactful as seen by the eyes of their bosses expecting mostly outcomes, but impactful in ways that brings tears from their eyes and that drains their creative potential if not their health. Although that can be an extremme, yet it doesn't disconnect from point from the Basecamp founders - that state of anxiety - where the doers are harmed and with that the impact turns out to be the lower performance to the organization. But if tears can't be seen, still it drive us nuts when we feel the feedback of that need for speed where tops-down goals mostly expects the gauges to reach high limits - expectations that are careless to whoever is behind the wheel. Much of that sounds like the harsh bad old days where self-called masters expected from people, their time and energy, and saw them as effort-deploying units that happens to walk and talk, and to be tired. 

Moreover, and even if we set ourselves in the startup way and become in the positions to manage ourselves and our own organizations, all that unfolds can be a big confusion - that has the power to impact in terms of making us not excited with the subject of managing goals and progressing with them. We get confused to see what appears to be a conflict between that tops-down view and the reality of the doers, of doing it. Without figuring things out, and when it is time to recruit others, and and even if we do not do it in the most brutal old ways,we still can't figure much what to do except to set some breezy version of setting tops-down expectation and expect outcomes in the hope that their subordinates can do it. That seems to be an unsolvable battle anyways, on one side the thing to do and on the other an outstanding request that sets an outcome and expects - such as from the doer to find their way. 

Following up with the perspective of not reinventing the wheel and growing from what management has given to us, let us move on towards the historical perspective from the evolution of goal-setting and management of goals and start by recognizing that the tops-down goals - that in many circumstances appears to be so harsh on us - can actually go along well with the reality of the doers where the bottoms-up discoveries make the real change and brings about the opportunity. And as said earlier, and as we go along with these elements, will be be checking with the OKR conversation.

#### Historical perspective - from management of time to the management of people

What appears from the historical perspective, the flight from above, is that the science of goal management is evolving to reduce that *fight from above*. What I mean is that management is adapting goal management, or stretching it, to enable more collaboration and by that more doers to become real constributors and so that they can achieve goals - especially that aspiring and ambitious goals are more frequent as opposed to the expected commitments where humans are expected to act as robots. The following passage from Stephen Covey, from *7 Habits of Highly Effective People*, we are moving from time management towards the managent of ourselves: 

> *"In the area of time management, each generation builds on the one before it - each one moves us toward greater control of our lives. The first wave or generation could be characterized by notes and checklists, an effort to give some semblance of recognition and inclusiveness to the many demands placed on our time and energy.
> The second generation could be characterized by calendars and appointment books. This wave reflects an attempt to look ahead, to schedule events and activities in the future.
> The third generation reflects the current time management field. It adds to those preceding generations the important idea of prioritization, of clarifying values and of comparing the relative worth of activities based on their relationship to those values. In addition, it focuses on setting goals – specific long-, intermediate-, and short-term targets toward which time and energy would be directed in harmony with values. It also includes the concept of daily planning, of making a specific plan to accomplish those goals and activities determined to be of greatest worth. 
> While the third generation has made a significant contribution, people have begun to realize that "efficient" scheduling and control of time are often counterproductive. The efficiency focus creates expectations that clash with the opportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs and to enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis."* 
> (Covey, Stephen., 1989, p.149-150)

He concludes, since we moved on from that *time management* to the management of ourselves, that we shifted from expecting tasks to be done - the *things* in *time*. And, as the fourth generation, we started an interest in accomplishing results and building relationships.

By the evolution that we have considered, the notions from management becomes clearn that the work of the doers carry on the important of performance from their actions and likely had improved towards the relationships. It goes along with that the notion that the state of well-being which supports their creative state. Or they get to know that over time as it is inescapable. Therefore, the perspective of the doers enters management, even if by fragments of what happens from the office of their psychologists, because it enters the workplace and because it impacts the organization's productivity. Peter Drucker, in Managing Oneself, portraits frames of the big movie and how the what is told is provoked with the what's happening:

> *"Throughout history, the great majority of people never had to ask the question, What should I contribute? They were told what to contribute, and their tasks were dictated either by the work itself - as it was for the peasant or artisan - or by a master or a mistress - as it was for domestic servants. And until very recently, it was taken for granted that most people were subordinates who did as they were told. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, the new knowledge workers (the so-called organization men) looked to their company's personnel department to plan their careers. 
> Then, in the late 1960s, no one wanted to be told what to do any longer. Young men and women began to ask, What do I want to do? And what they heard was that the way to contribute was "to do your own thing." But this solution was as wrong as the organization men's had been. Very few of the people who believed that doing one's own thing would lead to contribution, self-fulfillment, and success achieved any of the three."* (Drucker, Peter. 2008. pp. 35)

And goes on into a more enlightened view that the management of the self gains space, and consciousness, as the work place evolves. The modern doer is there, more aware of their development. They are alive and they react more. The following three elements of from the anyone working in an organization isn't a duty given by a manager but a way for the actual contributor to look at what they do there: 

> *"What should my contribution be? To answer it, it must address three distinct elements. What does the situation require? Given my strenghts, my way of performing, and my values. How can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference."* (Drucker, Peter. 2008. pp. 35)

With the early justification for going along with OKR - in terms of popularity in the space of high-growth organizations - as a lively conversation about goal-setting and management of goals, this context calls for checking the historical development of OKR. OKR didn't happen overnight but going backwards, its popularity was championed by John Doerr [^footnote_johndoerr_okr] through the evangelism work where he pushed the movement further inside Google, and later engaged wider audiences with the initiative entitled *What Matters* [^foonote_whatmatters_site] starting with the book entitled *Measure What Matters*, where the discussion continues to evolve. Visiting these resources will give you a view of the size and reach of the movement which is occupied with evolving the framework and ideas about goals and management of goals through real experimentation. 

[^footnote_johndoerr_okr]: John Doerr, a renowned venture capitalist, has been an advocate for the framework of Objectives and key results (OKRs) which he discusses in his book *Measure What Matters*. He learned much about that directly from Andy Grove during his time at Intel. 

[^foonote_whatmatters_site]: The "What Matters" web site, accessible through https://www.whatmatters.com/, is part of an initiative that gained popularity with the book from John Doerr "Measure What Matters," which promotes Objectives and key results (OKRs) as a goal-setting framework that helps organizations define and track objectives and outcomes. 

As said by John Doerr in Measure What Matters, much before it was widely know, his early movement to push at Google started from his motivations that he saw smart engineers working in magical ideas but as the company started to grow they would need a system to organize how to get things done, or as John would say how to focus on what matters. Thus, the development of OKR inside Google added strenght to form OKR, to grow its principles in ways that smart engineers from top-tier Silicon Valley firms would not dismiss: 

> *""* John Doerr, Measure What Matters 

Beyond that, or before that, OKR has origins with the teachings of Andy Grove while he was the CEO of intel and an educator championing the approach under the idea of MBO or Management by Objectives. John had the opportunity to learn directly from Andy Grove. I think that John fell in love with the vision and challenge where Andy - as an educator and manager - wanted MBO to be used inside of Intel to help his colleagues in planning after working; so that they could later *determine* the *decisions* to set the company in the direction of a better future. But to so that, of course, he needed a simple system to allow work to be done, the minimal unit for getting things done, to exist in the first place. Only after that celebration that any further analysis could happen. This is why Andy had to use a very simple set of questions about the work being done to start with:  

> *"A successful MBO system needs only to answer two questions. One, where do I want to go? The answer provides the objective. Two, how will I pace myself to see if I'm getting there? The answer gives us milestones or key results."* (Grove, A., 2015, pp. 111)

<!-- 
@meta @references
* reference - Grove, A. (2015). High Output Management. Vintage Books.
--> 

In other words, Andy needed first a responsible system with a fundamental element that granted permission to work to happen, and to happen transparently, without a critical system to attack the work being done while being done. For example, as I am writing this paragraph I am going for a specific milestone: to complete an initial editing of the draft of this chapter by the end of this week. Such milestone is helping me to focus, to work. With that I am trying to not be too critical as if I get distracted with that I can put the actual milestone in danger. Naturally, my goals expect a future version of this chapter to be useful to the reader. But that has to be a different milestone in the future; granted that will expect an other more formal editing effort to take place. It is my hope that this work of now appears in the end - and while it remains to be seen - but to be concerned with that it would be a waste of time right now. In other words, I am working and I know that even if this goes away and gets removed that should be possible because of further clarity achieved because of this work; therefore, this milestone is necessary, therefore my work of now is valid, therefore I am necessary just like I am being myself now.   

We will come back to the challenges of reviewing key results and objectives and the conversation about OKR from the perspective of learning and replanning. For now, I want to highlight that this component, that makes work possible and visible and concrete and measurable, is what gives the doer the opportunity to, first, to get involved if they feel they can join the boat, and if so to know what they have to do, through these milestones or key results. 




I have no doubt of an optimistic and humaninistic perspective in that component of MBO because it holds the allowance to work and also it allows the work to be seen. And naturally other humanistic perspectives will be equally necessary for progress to happen - or the whole OKR system to work well - which we will discuss ahead. But the point being is that Andy were concerned with enabling his colleagues to work and talk about what they were doing and that would not be possible if they didn't have a way to look into what is being done. This is also the right time to acknowledge the challenges that Intel went through when the company's leading position as a memory chip manufacturer were surprised by what Andy called "a 10x force" [^footnote_onlytheparanoidsurvive_intel] provided by the competition from Japanese memory chip manufacturers that had better technology which would likely sink Intel especially if Intel kept following strictly its long-term objectives. 

[^footnote_onlytheparanoidsurvive_intel]: Andy Grove's "Only the Paranoid Survive" discusses the concept of a 10x force as a significant change that it changes the fundamental dynamics of a business or industry. Grove elaborates on how Intel's need for adaptability in business.

By showing these aspects of the challenges of these managers, we can build a sense of values that were bundled and helped to shape the principles of OKR. Given what it was said, OKR starts - yes -  with the need for tops-down goals that can be accomplished and also can be quite ambitious: 

> *"An effective goal setting system starts with disciplined thinking at the top, with leaders who invest the time and energy to choose what counts."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)

The point is a great opportunity for us to consider that such idea of a 'disciplined thinking' done by a role of a leader has less to do any notion of any superior entity - like a boss that passes on what has to be done to subordinates ordering them to follow strictly like barbarians would ask. The point being does justice for the actual job of the leader to engage with such disciplined in the first place - an element which is necessary to guide any team even being that one person. In *Seven Habits of Highly Effective People*, Stephen Covey help us to see how that management works starts to build clarity:  

> *"Effective management is putting things first. While leadership decides what 'first things' are, it is management that puts them first, day-by-day, moment-by-moment. Management is discipline, carrying it out. "* (Covey, Stephen., 1989, p.148)

In other words, if we look at what to do and we happen to see people, and likewise the complexities with their communication such as subjective and variable communications that happens to be outstanding because they seem to know how get things done [^footnote_nightgale_outcomes], that should not confuse us about the essential point that goals - and clarity of goals - comes from the actual work of management of a role, or an entity, that uses a tops-down goal definition system as a communication system that sets upfront - as opposed to surprise people with what to do - and by that it proposes the objectives that prompt us to the actual work, or steps, which in conformance with our line of thinking, that are expected to be accomplished by measurable milestones, or key results.  

[^footnote_nightgale_outcomes]: Jonathan Nightingale had recognized, in *How Fucked Up Is Your Management*, that outcomes still matter (2017, p. 171). We went on to recognize that if everyone is measured by effort mainly is not great. With that, he recognizes that, in the end, "every company needs a set of folks who do understand the context, who can be held accountable for the right things actually getting done."

#### OKR on upfront goals and the mission or strategy








One will wonder if OKR would be a kind of system that happen to only be applicable after a giant machine - that knows where it is going - is moving; because generally the idea of setting tops-down goals and knowing things upfront carry some pressure in terms of a strict need to follow and to honor that plan and investment. And that is likely valid, to a certain extent, otherwise it would be like writing it down arbitrary moves which would likely confuse the doers. Still, that is why it is challenging anyway - and this involves certainly excitement and stress to a certain extent. Therefore, whoever mobilizes any effort has a degree of power, even if this starts with the work of a solo person. Given that challenging situation, it is still the sort of work that takes things out of the head of the leader that decides to do something that later becomes a startup. It gotta be something big enough to mobilize the effort anyway. 

But in the light of OKR, and given the growth demands of the startup situation, these leaders are asked to write in down and that in itself is an act of courage. No one is asking to waste time, such as to keep writing too much in ways that makes no sense and causes the doer to be doing nothing. The idea is that what is upfront planned is the upfront written and that gets to be what is upfront said which helps with the actual developments, the doing it in the first place in alignment with some of the ideas we have considered by now. These organizational aspects in OKR resonates with some of the following elements: 

* Putting things upfront is less about surprises - the exercise of doing it upfront demands courage and permission, or allowance. You may not know where you are going yet but you have to deal with it and to put it out. This process is what will help you and your team to understand that it is okay say upfront. As you put it out you are then granting permission to change too and you are going to - over time - to get you know and you and your team will get better in abstracting and conceptualizing after prior upfront developments happened. This is the opposite of making yourself and your team comfortable with surprises and arbitrary movements. 

* Formal team communications and clarity of priorities - even if you are alone but willing to move on with a team, the act of writing it down, and reviewing it, and coming up with statements that humans can read; will help you to read better, and to review it, also with others. With that, you are improving your team communications, you are developing a model that also disconnects the hidden thoughts of one or another - as you are setting an example - and therefore improves transparency. If something has to be improved, is the writing. Roles happen to be working on those things. 

* Craft a north star, the inspiring mission - it is okay to acknowledge what is there already, that we are after something that makes us feel incredible if that thing happened to be happen. But if not, it makes a lot of sense to have an idea for what future looks like. The very exercise of coming up with your north star will give you and your team a north to start. When this exists, it gives inspiration, and motivation, and from that the specific exercises of setting the work to do and expectations follows from. 

As you will see in the next section, these tops-down formalities will help with the initial design of the specific OKR plans - the more specific expections for what to do and why it matters - which  will involve the practice of revisiting frequently. In other words, expect that the tops-down design to not only influence but to facilitate the design of things to do and what to focus, to help with the break-down. A note from where we are. So far, there is nothing in the OKR, from these criteria for starting with the tops-down, that sets the whole ship to miss the need to understand what is going on, or to ignore the vital force of the doers which is essentially the role that does it and by doing so the role that discovers the need to change - we will get there.

#### OKR on the role of the contributor 





Now, if that role of the doer is alive and if OKR something to say about that is it so as a consequence of the very real frame of work that brought OKR. From the perspective of evangelism, John Doerr popularized it at Google and through the *Measure What Matters* but of course by checking its own usage and from its past experience by Andy Grove as he worked at Intel and learned about management by objectives directly from Andy. In addition, Andy has credited that he improved his views of management by objectives from Peter Drucker.

> *""* Andy Grove (Andy on Peter, from High Output Management)

All that to give us a view that OKR has strong points because of the interest if we want to make it real and strong and meaningful and if we are interested in improving it from the actual experience of doing it; and recognizing the changes that happens. Therefore, it is not unwise to consider that the willingness for one to contribute, in an organization, has ties with the effort to manage oneself. It's everywhere how OKR carries the viewpoint of the doer: 

> *"Leaders must get across the *why* as much as the *what*. Their people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)

Now if people to join projects, with causes and goals, they do because they know their strenghts can be used for the situation that needs to be changed. This is the premise necessary such as when one accepts to join the boat and even if they don't know, still it is by knowing what is ahead that they organize themselves to learn. You as a leader holds the position of responsibility where you have to be clear to start first pulling out from your head. This is what your team is dying to know [^foonote_michaeldearing_clarityteam] and this is a great first show of respect for your team - even if you have a too bold strong vision this is how any professional conversation starts.

#### The fight between the selfish and the non-selfish 







Before we move into the next section - the aspects of course-correction - it is worth to go back to an illustration of a fight and into an extrapolation of a generally assumed fight or source of anxiety between the tops-down things to do, protagonized through a historically a harsh bossy entity -  versus the bottoms-up effort of a doer that struggles under the relatinship and pressures of being a subordinate. Indeed, the tops-down, boss or manager or superior or an entity, appears to provoke a fight, indeed, with the bottoms-up role, the doer, the contributor, the effort maker. As if if one were the one that tells and on the other side the one that listen, and it is required to do and in the toxic condition is measured not by the effort but by the necessity to solve and achieve the outcome. This is then a source of anxiety where the doer suffers in many situations, such as anxiety or producing their tears as a by-product. 

But if these sides show a fight - by the photos we have taken of the workplace especially if we go back through history taking notes from the toxic organizations - we should use our time to pass through that hard wall and access an inner fight, or challenge, that really gets to feed that fire of the corporations that had created a lot of confusion to us. What is ahead, or under all that fire reveals an essential and struggle of a learning process when the doer is required to change, and by that a management process is required for enabling the new, the outcome, to be brought and change the system.  

Consider a micro context like a small team or even friends working, and even the micro context of an individual involved in the challenge to achieve an objective that is not easy. This is the fight that one deals with when they want to lose weight, or to learn to write, or to writer better, or to come up with an invention when the materials were not invented yet, or seeking some kind of freedom in the situation when the rules don't allow yet. When we lock in this situation - not by looking to any role of a bad person - we are required to recognize that achieving them goals will be hard, like it or not; and with that that we as managers have to face the reality for nurturing an environment for them to be achieved because the doer can only do one thing - to contribute - if they are onto it and involved and care. 




<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k1.3.2.1 - Management and grove on nurturing and supporting the surrender of the self for the team 
--> 




To celebrate a few OKR inputs up to this point - we should remember that OKR had asked us to have goals that are meaningful. As for the contributor, that there is an assumed inclination from the whole system that sought help and this doer, an interest in seeking what should be my contribution - which does not give up his values but recognizes the doer's weaknesses and strenghts. This relationship reveals two sides, the tops-down and the bottoms-up, or two personalities if you will where one being the doer that can be hold aspects of an apprentice and of an experts in various degree plus this doer can be also sensitive and innocent and generally feels good or hurt. On the other side, it is configured the personality of a critic or a judge or an editor that expects results, as a representative of the goals, a stakeholder. Our goal, as managers in the situation, has to do with the ability to look at what happens and reflecting so that we can help with what matters. Thus, we shall continue to check and nurture the conversation - like the OKR one - so that it can tell us how we can do our best, especailly that we may not know what to do and that furthermore the actual goals and therefore the ideas for how to get there aren't fully clear. Andy Grove came up with a viewpoint that recognizes the whole body work and the implication of it being that a system should exist that asks the individuals to do for the team: 

> *"To make such a body work requires the *voluntary surrender of individual decision making to the group*. Being a member means you no longer have complete freedom of individual action, because you must go along with the decisions of your peers in most instances. By analogy, think of yourself as one of a couple who decides to take a vacation with another couple. You know that if you go together, you will not be free to do exactly what you want to do when you want to do it, but you go together anyway because you have more fun, even while you'll have less freedom. At work, surrendering individual decision-making depends on trusting the soundness of actions taken by your group of peers."* (Grove, A., 2015, pp. 134-135)

<!--

--> 

In alignment with that, an enlightened view from Abraham Maslow gives us light into a a key aspect of "the fight" by considering that the doer is selfish and also the acknowledgement that her ability to perform, and to work, and to be embraced, shall lead her into accessing - if the environment is favorable - the non-selfish which is essentially to embrace adaptation: 

> *"This is an easy medicine for self-esteem: Become part of something important. Be able to say, "We of the United Nations . . ." or "We physicians . . ." When you can say, "We psychologists have proven that . . ." you thereby participate in the glory, the pleasure, and the pride of all psychologists any place. 
> This identification with important causes, or important jobs, this identifying with them and taking them into the self thereby enlarging the self and making it important, this is a way of overcoming also actual existential human shortcomings e.g., shortcomings in I.Q, in talent, in skill, etc. For instance, science is a social institution, with division of labor and colleaguehood *and* exploitation of characterological differences - this is a technique for making uncreative people creative, for making unintelligent men to be intelligent, for enabling small men to be big, for permitting limited men to be eternal and cosmic."* (Maslow, Abraham H., 1998, pp. 11-12)

<!--

--> 

This, of course, requires or goes along with a degree of a healthy, or enlighted condition, where the challenges of work are not affecting the doer's healthy condition to work and then it becomes the space for growth self and with that the expected growth of the work. 

Now, considering the possibility of a peaceful space between the role of the "one" that holds and expects the tops-down needs, now not being against the role of the contributor - the one that wants to contribute - the management of this health dynamics is not only the right thing to do - it's the necessary thing to do and the main thing to do. But also, when better explored or studied, such as under a calmer reflection, one will realize that this is the space where opportunity arises. That idea also goes along not only with the necessity for supporting the role of the doer but to support the role of the tops-down role that didn't have a full clarity and likely had phrased the tops-down goals - or for the matter where are we going - with limitations; which reveals the opportunity to let the actual work of the contributor role - individual or unit - to help with the discovery of clarity which will then help to course-correct the path. Let's move on to see how that opportunity to course-correct goals happens and how OKR offers a great deal of support to that.

## Course-correcting from goal-setting 






When it comes to translating objectives into actions - thinking that we started from the wishes and having entered the tops-down modeling effort after the higher-order goals - there is a natural and optimistic expectation - and purpose - for this modeling phase as a planning process to find things we can do that brings the objectives closer. 

With that said, you may remember what I have briefly introduced Andy Grove's intentions to put MBO in place as a practical system to help his colleagues in the planning by working although intended to help them to "*determine* the *decisions* to set the company in the direction of a better future," which goes inline with Andy's observation that "the true output of the planning process is the set of tasks that cause to be implemented." (Grove, A., 2015, p. 109)

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* reference - Grove, A. (2015). High Output Management. Vintage Books.
-->

But keeping that in hindsight, it still remains a challenging situation for the doers to be practical. And this is where we should - again - celebrate the simplicity in Andy Grove's two questions (2015, pp.111) from the management by objectives where the first answer "provides the objective," and the second "gives us milestones or key results:

* "Where do I want to go?" 
* "How will I pace myself to see if I'm getting there?" 

<!-- 
@meta @references
* reference - Grove, A. (2015). High Output Management. Vintage Books.
--> 

This second question is the birthplace of *key results*, or the milestones, which in alignment with great OKR thinkers [^footnote_okr_timebound] and set us to make them to be time-bound and to be clear - not ambiguous - for us and our colleagues. In other words, there is no doubt that OKR aims for achieving the objectives by having the objectives writen down and static and by having the key results written down and static. Yes, as I have said, that demands courage such as the courage to be wrong and to allow failure to happen - it's necessary. 

[^footnote_okr_timebound]: From the conversations about key results, both 'High Output Management' by Andrew S. Grove (2015) and 'Measure What Matters' by John Doerr (2018) align with Michael Dearing's General Management 2 course - https://www.harrisonmetal.com/classes/gm2-setting-goals-measuring-performance/lessons/magic-of-okrs - where key results need to be measurable and time-bound.

--> 




We shall then proceed to celebrate a natural question, or a complication with that idea, which is that it pulls the doer - the individual or the team working - towards being locked by the following the key results, which indeed could cause anxiety under circumstances when the performer feels that things are not going well in the future. Worse it is when, in the face of the feeling that things are not going well, the performer is pressured to work even more towards pre-defined key results, as if assuming that more effort would save the strategy. Along with that idea, we shall well celebrate a view of the horizon pointed out in the complication given to us by David and Jason, who stated: 

> *"the sooner you admit you have no idea what the world will look like in five years, three years, or even one year, the sooner you will be able to move forward without the fear of making the wrong big decision years in advance."* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33).

Indeed, when working in the path of uncertainty and seeking out to come up with innovative solutions - the situation of startups - in a world that changes fast, that sounds about right that it could be the situation that many founders live by. It might come a situation of conflict when the findings along the way pulls the team to reconsider what is going on while they they feel that they cannot change direction, that they cannot be creative. The situation if pushed further generates confusion such as the essential conflict with the question of Peter Drucker: how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?

That is why OKR sounds complex but it is the beauty of OKR too. OKR accepts things to be done, as written. OKR accepts that what was done may not pull the objective closer. OKR does not want the doer to be fired, or out of the loop, under these situations. OKR recognizes that these situations are just part of working and are the reasons why we work. In other words, OKR goes well with the view from Andy (2015, p. 102) that "planning is an ordinary everyday activity; it's something all of us do all the time with no fanfare, in both our personal and professional lives."

#### OKR on non-ambiguous and strategic flexibility of objectives  






Therefore, it is justifiable to question if OKR has mechanisms in place that support teams to evaluate and course-correct what they do, as they go. The short answer to that is that that is why OKR is for. But as a longer one, OKR exists to help with pulling the objectives closer after the fact that the doing of it allow further reflection and evaluation. In other words, nothing can be improved if you don't know what you are doing - through the key results. But when you know it, it creates an opportunity for objectives to be evaluated, and then as a new iteration happens, new Objectives and key results to be designed. To give you an idea of cadence, it may be the case that the analysis of key results happens in terms of weeks; but keep in mind that the cadence of reviewing the KRs and the Os have a lot to do with the variability and learnings that the activity demands. As an example, if you set yourself to build a wall to your house, and you know that the challenge is pretty straight, it makes sense to not bother much with the reflecting and reconsidering the KRs since you can sense that the steps in to achieve the KR as expected are properly pulling your objective closer. But of course, with more ambitious key results, and the potential variability of internal movements - from the effort put in place - the analysis of key results can be benefited from a specific and strategic cadence. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.4  - answer -

But again, and back to the point of this section - the point being is that OKR has to supports the possibility that objectives and the key results were not well designed given the actual north that we are after. Just keep in mind that not knowing exactly the future can be interpreted as an opportunity which should not be confused with writing poorly the objectives and key results such as in ways like being unrealistic or ambiguous. The key to help doers from a potential bad direction - and under the optimistic view to achieving a great and promising future - lies in nurturing the work that allow them to essentially transcend from the actual execution being done.

Accordinng to What Matters, there are different kinds of objectives that in essence demand different attitudes. 

* Committed - 
* Aspirational - 
* Learning -

The complication with choosing the right kind of objective - defining the attitude - is essentially the opportunity to be strategic given the where we are and where we want to go. Consider the following illustration given by Billy Casey (2024) in Dear *Andy: "Lights On" OKRs* of a restaurant chef that struggling under the pressure of coming up with aspirational and motivational OKRs:

> *"Dear Andy,*
> 
> *My partners and I are currently in the process of opening a new restaurant in NYC’s West Village (fingers crossed we’ll be able fully open by late summer), and I want to create OKRs for my team to keep us focused and motivated. We have our company-wide Objective: Be a second home for the people in our neighborhood. We’ve also recently figured out our mandatory financial benchmarks we need to meet to pay the bills (X amount in profit, keep labor under X%, etc.). I know OKRs are supposed to be aspirational and motivational, but is it a good idea to include the “keep the lights on” goals somewhere in there, too?*
> 
> *Chef Claire"* (Casey, B., What Matters, 2024)

A great first point from Andy had recognized that the idea as valid under the assumption that it means what matters to the team; which is about celebrating that it moves the needle: 

> *"[..]*
> *Goals like “keep the lights on,” or, to be a little cheeky, “don’t run out of money,” would be considered committed OKRS (the things that must be achieved). You can absolutely include these types of revenue based goals in your OKRs — as long as you’ve decided that’s what matters most.*
>
> *Andy"* (Casey, B., What Matters, 2024)

And Andy goes on to make the point that the accomplishment of that objective - in the situation of success - will likely bring them into the opportunity to move on, to keep moving the needle further: 

> *"[..]*
> *Once you’ve got your system locked into place and your restaurant is running like a well-oiled machine, you can file that OKR under “business as usual” and shift your focus on growth opportunities.*
> 
> *Andy*" (Casey, B., What Matters, 2024)

This example shows how these attitudes go well together and that it can be harmonious.

#### OKR on needs for courage for transparency 


Consider an OKR that started with an initial objective, such as an objective that was created ahead of any work, such as one that comes from a mission or a vision. It does so with the purpose of pushing the design process of OKR into the modelling, or planning, for the steps that are thought to be steps that pulls the objective closer. 

This part, the key results part of OKR, appears first as a mechanism to keep track, that adds transparency, and which reveals what is being done and what is ahead. In additin, it is also a mechanism that offers a window of opportunity to see what goes on and how what is being done connects with where we want to go. Here is where OKR starts to get complicated as, in essence, it's becomes a collaboration mechanism. What I mean by complicated is that much more simpler to simply use OKR for tracking, as in a stream that goes to one direction, than for enabling it as a collaborative communication tool that allows teams to evaluate what they do, to change what they are tracking, if not to chage what they are going after. 





<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.1.1 - Collaboration - Example - Case of a book writing, the goal and the doing it. 
--> 




Through a case of a writer's situation - which may apparently look like a non-collaborative effort of a solo person - we can better see how the mechanics of using key results can be powerful a transparent and honest work effort of doing things, when supported by the right environment, can lead to greater impact - which in the case of the writer is to have the book published in order to help his audience. With that, we will be celebrating how the upfront writing is necessary, or daring if you will, and how the accomodation of key results sets the doer in the direction of progress.

From the following situation which I used as an example in the section about leadership:  

> *"For example, as I am writing this paragraph I am going for a specific milestone: to complete an initial editing of the draft of this chapter by the end of this week. Such milestone is helping me to focus, to work. With that I am trying to not be too critical as if I get distracted with that I can put the actual milestone in danger. Naturally, my goals expect a future version of this chapter to be useful to the reader."* Marcio Galli (2024)

Consider an initial note where this writer pinned in wall with a top label "Have a great chapter about how to progress with goals" which is part of this higher order goal of having his book published to help the startup audience with a more conscious execution. From the general situation, he expected to deliver pages, and pages into chapters, and a lot of other processes to pull the ambitious goals closer. At any point in time, his OKR had to had key results that he believed could be helpful. A note here is that OKR as a framework can't give him or you or anyone the actual strategy such as to judge  [^footnote_michaeldearing_judging_examples] the key results. 

He had then consider a prime key result as "To write down the whole sections to comply with the current chapter's outline," by the a given date with a reminder for him, necessary under the time-bound condition, that he would not be engaging in reviewing the text, or judging the text, and by that he supports his work even to a point of allowing a sort of naive writing to happpen even if that brings about what he or a critic would consider as poor writing. Therefore, if his KR shows nuances of a scoring it does so from the perspective of the valuing work effort but not from the aspect of grading, or judging the work - not yet. That makes, for him, the KR of "delivering pages" to be quite valid. With that, he had set himself to let the work to happen first. And only then, after key results accomplished, an opportunity can be considered such as a reflection to happen. In other words, the purpose of his OKR expects a communication to happen where he would be able engage in the evaluation cycle and so to come up with a new OKR. 

[^footnote_michaeldearing_judging_examples]: From GM2 course from Harrison Metal, a real OKR of a highly technical founder was shown with the objective as "Understand the business side of our company so I can be a better founder," and his top KR to "Analyze two customers product use per week and write notes." Michael had noted, in case we find ourselves trying to judging it, that "it is his list, not yours," point being that the judgement of what ambitious means has to do with what matters to the doers.

Altough the example seem to show a lonely process, it reveals a collaborative aspect that is used by organizations that reportedly do OKR well. Consider how individuals can take advantage of posting their OKRs, of sharing it. If we come to realize that this situation takes a great culture and effort, and by that that they enjoy the benefits of a virtuous collaborations such as colleagueship where people are helping each other, then, in essence, we're noticing and valuing that we need to see what's being done in the first place, and that's the primary movement that is necessary which deserves a lot of caring and nurturing.

From the work of doing it, he had respected the effort which was time-bound as safe. The approach had given to him the permission to push out words, of letting thoughts to come about. When he had reflected on his ability to progress, he had acknowledged the benefits of writing with no interruptions such as that he had achieved clarity for many ideas. As he had completed the work, he even felt motivated to modify some ideas from his writing, to come up with new sections, and to review the outline. 

Moving on, following the OKR approach, he engaged in the new version of his OKR with specific KRs where the main one were "read the content and mark keywords and interesting phrases," and the next as "to make a new version of the outline," all of that under the objective that asked for coherence and clarity to the chapter. And after that, he would then move on, again and again, coming up with OKRs that matters to the project. Notice that a collaborative aspect in the situation comes from the protected situation that each OKR had provided - where he had to assume a certain "personality" to keep the progress going, such as to hold on and supress his natural willingness to be critisizing his writing in realtime in the first phase. 

Therefore, and I know that I asking you to be flexible here, a collaborative process is configured even in this apparently "solo" situation, if we consider that the role that judges it - the one that edits it and is the holder of the tops-down things to do - would be inclined to be critically active "on top" of the role that needed to write. The nuanced understanding of the whole situation of the doer that had to to align with the team's purpose - to complete the chapter - required the separation of these roles, and with that their activities, and required the critic-editor to step back. With the critic on the side, and waiting for his moment, and the KR of the writer allowing pages to happen, the young writer spirit of the doer was activated and he were able to write - even with the poor English if that was the case - and to let all his ideas to flow and to let his innocence to happen through the writing. And colleagueship happened to be the case, the respect happend to be recognized, and then he were happy doing that that he even started to like his critic-editor. That first OKR, in essence, and under the view of a collaborative situation, became the contract that allowed the young writer to do his job. With that, and after the recognition that he did his work - the milestone - the young writer happened to get the review from the critic-editor and they lived happily thereafter.

#### OKR on learning with key results 

There is a strong idea of output which was brought by Andy Grove in High Output Management, that deserves a calmer reflection in front of the not so calm situation of work. What Andy were after with the propositions for Management by Objectives consisted in allowing people to work and then asking them to get involved in checking if what they did really sets them in the direction which they have specificed in their objectives. In other words, if the outcome sought were the objective accomplished, the output expected had to be the new decisions coming after work: 

> *"Thus, the true output of the planning process is the set of tasks that cause to be implemented. The output of Intel's annual plan, for instance, is the actions taken and the changes prompted as a result of the thinking process that took place throughout the organization. I, for one, hardly ever look at the bound volume finally called the Annual Plan. In other words, the output of the planning process is the *decisions* made and the *actions* taken as a result of the process."* (Grove, A., 2015, p. 109)

BUt likewise with the concerns, these are there in ways that the doer is real, a contributor, and not following blindly. The opportunity is for understanding the best work possible and also reading from the data, the real information that is applicable to the context. In the view of Andy the meetings with the managers are the key aspect where the doer is the owner and the manager is there to help: 

> *""* Andy Grove, High Output Management 

Andy Grove elaborates on the aspects of the strategic management that arises from the actual involvement, the actual work. As an example, the opportunity lies in the identification of "both effect and counter-effect." This in essence has to do with checking the impact or the cost of the impact or the like against the higher order objectives or the bolder and ambitious goals in the view of the transcendence, which does not disconnect from the considerations about the self versus the non-selfish we have seen. 
As an example, a prior situation of an indicator could involve the doer to be attached and see the indicator as "my precious" in a given moment in time. 

As an illustration, consider the case of Harriet Tubman which I will add some elements of fiction but of course to make a point following from the actual values and virtues of her historic and brave heroic life. From the history of Harriet, she were able to escape the enslaved condition and by that she had achieved practical freedom to a certain degree. And she had achieved that as she had used her skills and following her aspirations. But connected with that, she had other aspirations and ambitions for freeing the others. Naturally, she had the idea of starting with her friends and people that she loved which you can confirm that by watching Michael's talk (2018) or the movie [^footnote_harriet]. 

[^footnote_harriet]: Spoiler alert - The following content contains spoilers for the movie 'Harriet.' In the film, after successfully escaping, Harriet Tubman's story notably includes her profound desire to free her friends and family.

And according to Michael Dearing, Harriet had to come up with new strategies, or to scale her operation or model; to make that work because she wouldn't be able to just free all the slaves all of the sudden using the same sort of key results, or methods that she were using in the beginning. She could, for example, dream about scaling if we were writing a private letter to herself; but even if she did it would not achieve results if not she would end up in more trouble by the existance of the letter. Therefore, and under the circumstances of the relative success that she had, which is actually too big as a relative because that was the prime movement for the opportunities for scaling; Harriet had to face the challenges and transcend and accept the non-selfish aspects involved in being rigorous or strict with the same approach of guiding small groups of people through the woods. In other words, and as she had achieved her milestones and new knowledge, she had to organize herself, to change herself, to adapt and to transcend from attachments with the prior attitudes; in order to get there and to free a lot more people later. In essence, she moved from helping herself to being a conductor and her key results reflected that too.

#### Team dynamics for high self-esteem and creation 







> ".................." 

When exposing what we do, the things we are doing, and letting others chime in to help, even people that are not connected directly, it is natural to consider that the mechanism promotes communication and open ideas to flow in which would result in an opportunity to reduce self bias and improve not only effectiveness, in the sense of performance for what is being done and in the sense of the simpler nature of accounting and tracking, but also taken that this simpler factor is present, the more complex collaborative communication which is the opportunity to evaluate all that is being done. 

Consider that the point about transparency and collaboration has to do not with the benefits like gambling, of one helping with the other, as if people have the clicks, that is a by-product of doing in a collaborative and transparency way. But in addition to that, it is important to recognize that transparency, having things written down, also reveals failure in the eyes of everyone, which could be complicated depending on the effects from the exposure of failure, such as if the protagonists of the failed propositions aren't to be valued. Therefore, in other words, the exposure goes along with the necessity of the right attitude, a system of protection which when exists gains a strategic meaning, as indicated by Michael Dearing, gains a tone of competition, a healthy competition: 

> *"It seems to me that the best product roadmaps come from vigorous internal competition for time and talent from engineering, design, marketing."* Michael Dearing (2016)

The point suggested by Micheal was isnpired from the general point about competition in macro markets (2016) - the situation and acknowledgement that competition drives better results with the rise of the winning competitor. But then, deriving from that, it comes the natural question if any of that is the actual mechanism we use when we come up with a better thing to do in the face of our goals. Perhaps Michael saw the whole world as a one big company which is the analogy for the intercal micro market and the notion of competition. In this model, consider that there is the input of doing, from doing, from vision, from brainstorming, first in the beginning of a process like a funnel. And then, a quantitative and qualitative judgement chimes in which separates the gold from the things that we can separate, as in the data to support recyling it. 

But a quite important aspect of it has to do with the need for transparency and exposure. "Put the roadmap where everyone can see it is one of the most powerful actions a founder can take." (2016) which goes along with " It is to be expected that people who care about what they work on are disappointed when something doesn’t work out the way they wanted. The approach above arms them with the information they need to make sense of the disappointment and to improve the probability that their next ideas will get funded." (2016)

Notice that in the illustration he created the idea of "funded" can be interpreted as approved or the general idea of buy-in.

##### The situation of a healthy iteration 






The effort of redoing the OKR hundreds of times, is for the sake of being open. Now, in this regard, a question that comes is if OKR does not allow room for bottoms-up contributions that affects the tops-down. Part of it I have covered, the conversation is there. But the cycle for reviewing all the top down plan exists too and bottoms-up contributions is recognized as key. In other words, the approach needs and depends on the confrontation of the what we want to do with the what is happening. Of course, the cadence for that sort of strategic planning work might have a cadence, needs a cadence applicable to the organization.

The very process that Michael has suggested seems to go along well with the individual situation of a writer - so I this makes me comfortable to see a pattern and then to consider the situation of the individual being the same of the team; which may help us to achieve clarity of that the problem we have for achieving ambitious goals is always the problem of finding support and may also connects with high self-esteem. 

Consider the ideas from Jordan Peterson from his *Essay Writing Guide* [^footnote_jordanpeterson_essaywritingguide]. When all starts in the lifecycle of an essay, after she had chosen a topic and wants to go writing, he suggests that our inclination to "write trite, repetitive and cliché introductions and conclusions" are real. And he even acknowledges - under the view of supporting the work to happen - that it is "often useful" to *write* a stock introduction, such as "What is the purpose of this essay?" as part of the process which is to say that these elements will be later be thrown away.

A similar situation happens in the end of the process when it is time to edit paragraphs through a process that he uses that consists of creating two screens and comparing article A with a variation of it on the side. He goes on and illustrates that through his process he will be editing and literally testing different paragraphs til he finds one that is good and does justice to what he expects of the paragraphs according to the outline. According to Jordan: 

> *""* (Peterson, J., )

When I read Jordan illustrating this process "of the self" it was inescapable for me to see the role of a doer, a contributor, that were able to innocently try different things - such as a competing paragraph - in the attempt to match the objective, the ouline. In way, this goes well with the idea of a highly supportive environment for a writer to get to the point of, as pointed by Jordan if one goes towards the publishing, to let it go and remove 80% of the thoughts behind, under the achievement of more clarity. In other words, by keeping up and accepting the momentary injustice [^footnote_momentary_injustice], and keeping the innocence high and safety for healthy competition, we can advance and connect towards the objective, even to a point of transcending and understanding that the higher-order objective - such as an outline - has to change. By going through that, we go through change ourselves.

--> 

#### OKR on the non-creative work space 






Of course, depending on the culture, toxic aspects can come the way to influence the process to offer no value. For example, depending on how the measurement of performance of an employee is done, such as when the compensation is associated with the key results and moving towards the Objective as written, then the results can be catrastrofic. Would one want to course correct its path, after having good reasons for so, after knowing that she or he could be evaluated as bad performer and even get fired? That kind of situation would certainly bring anxiety and a lot of distractions for a call that would not likely happen. 

It's important to pause here and reflect that a lot of companies indeed entered that mode. They set goals in stone, they put prizes for the people that follow the path as written, and they punished the ones that didn't do well, that in other words, couldn't achieve those numbers expected, such as outcomes. So by doing that, the company, the organization, engages in the very same process where the king used to kill the messenger, because the messenger brought bad news. That's the reason for why key results are milestones. They need to have an association with the actual effort, and not exactly an association with the outcome it the notion of outcome is connected with the very thing that evalutes people. 

Then it comes the question, do they course correct? Yes but they do that in macro terms, by facing a crisis, which likely involve getting people fired, managers fired, teams reorganized. From the point of view of an employee, under a whole team that got fired for moving in the bad direction claiming it was good, the employee generally tries to escape the spiral of death by reclaiming that he was told to do that job and was performing well. In a lot of situations like that, a lot of people can get away. But still, anxiety was present and a lot of effort to manage the crisis which can and should be considered a bad use of the time of people. 

Therefore, it is ideal to think that a plan for progressing is not about a plan for evaluating people - as in to consider them in or out the boat. This is a key aspect of the OKR approach that when well considered can make OKR become a useful tool and one that also serves well for course-correcting and actually bringing everyone on board and focusing on what matters. 

With cadence for evaluating what's being done, with allowance for reviewing, with transparency and strategic thinking too, and with the subjectiveness and the judgment of the things being done, and as we shall remember Andrew Grove saying that, "but the MBO system cannot be run mechanically by a computer. The system requires judgment and common sense to set a hierarchy of objectives and the key results that support them. Both judgment and common sense are also required when using MBO to guide you in your work from one day to the next." (2015, pp. 114)

This approach that can help the people to change the plan at the level of key results and objectives is the very approach that recognizes that the effort is what matters in the first place, and along with the effort, the capacity to reflect on effort and actions, and by that of course, the true output of management by objectives rises, that is, to come up with decisions and actions.

## The output, the input, and the outcome 

There are situations that teams enter the OKR train as it stops beautifully on time in the station. It’s a trip with a goal, such as to learn and use OKR in the best way possible. But then we enter in it, the wagon starts smooth and the scenery is beautiful, it’s unbelievable and the roadmap seem to make sense with scenes around. But then, give it some time and housing passing by. Suddenly the lights of the train blinks arbitrarily and we hear something craking as the speed of the train increases fast. A yellow light fades under the seat and people start to be worried. Next stop, unknown, the train enters a tunel, the heater stops working, and it goes on for another 2 hours with the speed increasing. What is next will blow your mind. You can't go back to revisit the trip. You are on it and it is going of the tracks. This is where you start to lose faith in your OKR trip and your training.

But if any of this sounds unrealistic in our work lives - or to a business book - the sad truth is that there is no alarm or crises or big crashes or fanfares. We generally can't even read what goes on withthe crew and get to become passangers of a fast-moving train and by that just working, and in many situations not noticing that we are drifting and losing purpose. Of course, until some crisis happens and will one day although it may be difficult to connect the dots. 

The way that Christina Wodtke puts the problem - from her article entitled *"Are You Sure You Want to Use OKRs?"* - can lift our spirits from the apparently safe seats we are and bring our focus to the purpose of the trips we do: 

> *"There is a concept I call drift. Drift means that a process has drifted away from the original framing. It happened to Agile. What started as a simple idea that people should work collaboratively and iteratively became people policing each other on the True Agile Way: “this is how to write a user story” and “Stand up can’t be more than 15 minutes long.”"* (Wodtke, 2022)

This is a complication in the founders's way not disconnected from what we have discussed in the chapter entitled *Lean attention deficit*. Call them frameworks or methods or tools, Christina's point of "the drift" goes straight to what I think is a phenomenon. But to be fair, the drift is also part of an ongoing conversation and the actual exploration - or the conversation in time that it needs to happen. Therfore if any real complication is here in front of us it may be so the problem of us not knowing that history is yet happening, that a lot is happening quite fast  and while we are here trying to discuss part of of what we think is a movie, new episodes are happening; by all the heated activities that take place, inside companies and outside of them.

One case that is source of confusion - not only from the doubts of a first time learner but an actual struggles of getting it right - which makes OKR difficult - is what appeared to me, initially, to be a battle in the field of key results, between Output vs. Outcome. 

Through my learnings I had read that the best companies doing it right seemed to be figuring their right conduction of it, such as for years [^footnote_johndoer_yearsokr]. And indeed that are a lot of aspects that could set a team into that feeling that I said in the beginning - willing to give up - due to the so many abstractions and nuances for trying to tame and to conduct as a framework the thing that has a lot to do with the real temperamental underlying element as I also have said, the humans, and by that the complexities of conducting in the best way. 

[^footnote_johndoer_yearsokr]: 

While a lot from the original readings seemed to make sense, as we have convered with the idea of output as the thing we are interested; then the words from the real world of experience in the various kinds of companies seemed to indicate that teams were using it their way. But it was sad anyway to see a battle, and the heated discussion, coming from the fields of the doing, and not in the actual classic materials.

Next, we will get into the origins of such "battle" of outcomes vs. output; but with the intention of recognizing that a lot is going on with context and conditions assumed by authors and practitioners and of the startups they are looking it. As we break down some aspects of it we will dive in the essential elements that influences us to have different opinions for how to measure; which shall help us to be in peace and to bring the context back to the essence of measuring, which connects with the need for judgement as Andy had suggested to us. We will finally close with a reflection that considers outcome, output and input as illusions in the hope to set us free from the details and bring our focus back to what matters.

To be fair with Christina, notice that the context may matter. In the above view, she had assummed what she referred as "prep work" which I would then relaltively agree with the idea of key results to have that inclination to outcomes, if you have indeed a crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency: 

> *"Do the prework. Make sure you have a crisp strategy. Make sure your teams have psychological safety. Make sure your product teams are multidisciplinary (Product, Design and Engineering.) Fire bad managers. Adopt Agile and Lean practices. Create as many self-sufficient teams as possible. Value effectiveness over efficiency."* (Wodtke, 2022)

#### The lagging possibility  

Notice that a poor implementation of a key result could happen both ways with output-based key results or with outcome-based key results. Under the possiblity of the extremme cenario of towards the activity, Christina had expressed her call to make the point that the key results had to be "outcome, not outputs." That because she feared that the product of a work effort could not help with the outcome expected by the objectives. 

On the other side of the spectrum, the too eager drive to set numbers - even the ones associated with outcomes - in the key results could actually result in making the team to engage in various efforts, such as to be creative within the box, which could them set them to run outside the radar of OKR, therefore outside the radar of learning - which goes inline with the consideration from What Matters professors [^footnote_coursera] that *"in reality, revenue rarely makes a good KR because it's often the outcome of many different actions over the course of the cycle." They go on to explore the lagging situation by the possibility that *"by the time the revenue has come in, it's too late to say if the actions leading to the revenue were working.*" 

[^footnote_coursera]: This observation is part of "Refining your KRs" in the course "OKR Certification: Leadership and Goal Setting" by John Doerr, Ryan Panchadsaram, and Lisa Shufro. See Doerr, J., Panchadsaram, R., & Shufro, L. (2024). OKR Certification: Leadership and Goal Setting. Coursera. Retrieved January 29, 2024, from https://www.coursera.org/learn/okr

--> 

To be clear, these folks - Christina and the folks from What Matters do care about the very same problem that the outcome is anyway the thing we are after - and the whole reason for OKR to exist anyway: 

> *"Although an output in many cases can serve as measurement, outputs don’t necessarily lead to outcomes. And in the name of productivity, it is quite easy for teams and leaders to lose sight of their overall Objective and instead, shift focus to their outputs. However, outputs must clearly communicate what will change — in other words, they must make a difference."* (Head, Kandice., WhatMatters, 2024)

<!-- 
@meta @references
* reference - Head, K. (2024). Output vs. Outcome with OKRs. What Matters. Retrieved January 29, 2024, from https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/outputs-vs-outcome-okr
--> 

Thus we can celebrate the nuanced and enlightened reminder from What Matters asking us to keep our heads towards what is the purpose of all of this and not to drift away in any way. 

> *"Outputs are not meaningful independent of describing the outcome. However, good outcome-focused Objectives help teams identify which outputs are most likely to lead to the desired outcomes."* (Head, Kandice., WhatMatters, 2024)

In other words, the team should be responsible to strategically identify at what level should key results capture and even the possibility of mixing them (2020) so it they can see what is really going on and not lead the team into being arbitrary. If an outcome-based key result captures the movement within, then it might be fine. But if an outcome-based key result leads to arbitrariness, the point of OKR is then missed.

#### Challenges with variability of maturity  


But if all of this sounds simple, it isn't - not because OKR is complex but because, again, the beast within is complex not only due to the human nature where we are all learning but because the whole crew might be onto something that simply no one knows how to solve yet. 







[3] An article that helped me to see the two sides of the spectrum was this one from this guy named Josh Seiden - https://medium.com/@jseiden/to-write-better-okrs-use-outcomes-e82be6e7b460 as he included the cartoon image (Resources -> Activities -> Output -> Outcome -> Impact) which he attributes to "The Project Logic Model, adapted from Kellogg Foundation"

So up to here, I had identified the complication in the learning journey of a founder.Moving towards the potential answer, the following author gave us a cartoon to help us understand Output vs. Outcome, although he promotes Outcome-based for OKR:+ Cartoon is [Resouces -> Activites -> Output -> Outcome -> Impact]https://medium.com/@jseiden/to-write-better-okrs-use-outcomes-e82be6e7b460







That shows a complex approach that some of the Mozilla managers had for measuring folks, where "junior people can be measured by effort" while "the outcome can measure senior people."The framing of this last article helped me see correlations with:+ junior/senior+ unknown/known+ divergence/convergence+ aspirational/commitment+ effort/outcomeAnd that helped me to see better that the adjustment of the needle (from action, to output, to outcome) could be done depending on the context of the objective.Therefore, if you don't know much about what you are doing, you can measure by effort and revisit faster (100 times). If you are confident, the measure could be oriented towards an outcome.That could also explain why composed OKR (team level) could be more oriented to outcomes and why an individual could be more oriented to effort. Not sure.

[4] Until today. When I was following the articles in order, you had your "/5" article referring to the "/29" article (Leadership is not about your good intentions / https://mfbt.ca/leadership-is-not-about-your-good-intentions-5e21666cb01b ) which has provoked my mind as I reached the following diagram:

* "Junior people we evaluate on effort."
* "Senior people we evaluate on outcomes."

The above blew my mind, my friends. A neuron in a galaxy far away was able to say hi to another neuron in another faraway galaxy.

But it wasn't only that, you kept, in this article, provoking my mind with things such as "who is junior" or "what means junior" or "why?"

Having had a light, I am here pondering one thing as I try to go back to Output vs. Outcome in the context of OKR. Besides the excellent spectrum provided by [3] Seid, this potential addition has to do with the visualization that effort might go along with design/divergent thinking on the one hand. In contrast, the outcome might go along with design/convergent.

* As in - diverge vs. converge
* As in - discover vs. execute
* As in - aspirational vs. commitment

I do not know if my awakening has a significant flaw, but something seems linear here or structured about the problem.






#### Driving towards seasoned 


> *"As you get more seasoned, your strategy is biased toward social and business problems instead of cognitive ones. You learn how to run a meeting and how to pre-flight the important decisions before that meeting even starts. . . "* (Nightingale, J., 2017, p.170)

##### Who is the junior? 

What matters, really, is that you can be just out of the sudden under a need to flip yourself, to embraced a personality, to model it, to consider the maturity level for that task. In other words, no matter how senior you are, you can be a junior at any time depending on your objectives ahead: 

> *"Holding a junior employee accountable for the success of the organization isn’t realistic. Without those strategies, they don’t know how to make success happen. So we substitute in productivity goals, progress goals. Are you writing clean code? Are you collaborating well?"* (Nightingale, 2017)

--> 





##### Introducing variability through and outcome in the face of the low maturity 

An outcome of setting a mature expectation to your now-junior doer is that you generate a potential for the doer to enter in manipulating and a state of anxiety that can even - in an extremme - push them to come up with manipulation - under the strict idea of "this is the way" you bring about rupture to your working team - and moreover misses the point which is using the effort phase to bring about and to discover maturity: 

> *"When you’re new it’s hard to know the difference between a bad idea, a good idea with the wrong team, and a good team with a bad plan. It encourages people to be hair trigger and awful to each other as a way to seem smart. It encourages other people to leave."* (Nightingale, 2017)

> *"But outcomes still matter. The buck has to stop. I've seen companies that score everyone on effort, but I have never seen great companies that do so. Every company needs a set of folks who do understand the context, who can be held accountable for the right things actually getting done."* (Nightingale, J., 2017, p. 171)

The model which we aim, which especially is the case for startups, is that the roles are dynamic. The "mature" corporate situation has the light for the solution. If you are mature enough to do that, it is then that you are positioning and understand that there is a way to actually push the outcome you want:

> *"Every company needs a set of folks who do understand the context. Who can be held accountable for the right things actually getting done. That’s what executives are for. You are the people who turn strategy into execution. It’s a hard job. It’s why you get a fancy title and a high salary and a team of people. You need to prioritize, spot problems early, adapt and adjust. You need to empower your teams to be creative, but never step so far away that you lose the thread of how they’ll get it done. "* (Nightingale, 2017)

This again aligns with the given "prep work" suggested by Christina, in my rewriting, the "crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency." (Wodtke, 2022)

#### But seeking the holy grail may bring about the interference of numbers 

We all know what we are after, it might even become a sacred as we get into the natural business of organizing ourselves, or to mobilize efforts and even rituals, when we are after that: The Holy Grail is an outcome in the end. That need is in all of us and it is the very reason that on many circumstances we will find our ways to cross that bridge since we shall not be afraid to answer any question if a gatekeeper requests it in the first place.

The possibility for dealing with those legitimate moments of struggle - where literally one could be catapulted out of the team situation - is to bounce back the question in ways that we check the validity and the absurdity of the whole situation. Leaving the bridge the the holy grail in the past but sticking with the truths of our corporate tales, it may be appropriate to celebrate the view from Jeff Bezoz given by Jason Child when he said that Jeff Bezos is famous for optimizing for the truth-seeking culture: 

> *"And he would get into business, and then we'd look at stuff, and then he would see things, and if looked really good or really bad, he turned to me and he says, 'Is this number right? And would you stake your career on it?'"* Jason Child (Greylock, 2017, 14:37)

Jason went on and added that the whole point of Jeff was to make sure that the analytics were not lying because, "you can lie with numbers very easily. You know, is a subscriber a customer? Is it including reactivation? Is it including, .. you know, there are so many ways you can make it say what you want it to say." Jason Child (Greylock, 2017, 14:37)


#### Scoring of heroes 

The idea of not being so hard is exactly about allowing the doer to fail with the key results and reevaluate which key results bring the doer "back into" the promising direction. Now for thre sake of solving the complex question - should I go with outcome or output - and given the point given, we may use, for the sake of the reflection, the advice from the professor of the MWM Course: 

> *"Contribution is not the same as “making your OKRs.” Did this person make smart choices and stay focused on moving the numbers? Did they gain traction? Did they learn what not to do? And not everyone can contribute to OKRs, so you will need something more than “making OKRs” to evaluate them on.*" (Wodtke, 2022)

The likely core of the worriness of Christina has to do with the struggle if you are interested in being open about the actual efforts you make. The point of her intention - in my view - has to do with "giving up" a potential challenging part of OKR - to see the output and discuss - and to allow the team to get away, to deal with it. And by the way, the point given in the following interview, she recomments a good brainstorming for the key results design:

Adjusting Christina's approach to make it work with the output-based, would be about acknowledging first the good intentions in the good not the best: 

>*"The best is the enemy of the good. If you are spending weeks refining the language of the objective and pinning down just the right metrics, your company is in the business of process management. That’s wasteful. Try to make good OKRs but remember there is a time when you have to say, good enough for now. You don’t want to spend three weeks setting your goals and lose the time you could be working toward them instead." (Wodtke, 2022)

And isn't it the case that some times, often or not so often when we have time, a saying says that "the angel lives in the details," or something like that. And there I felt in front of a quote which I have imagined the so many interpretations that were possible. To be fair, the context matters. But I feared anyway that an urgent reader-learner could miss the good in the details where she meant to say that we should not spend more time mostly refining our OKR and less time working. That is why I rather keep that quote outstanding but still to see how it could well be applicable to the situation - which I find quite important anyway - that involves the possibility of a doer that keeps on refining the language of the objective a lot in the best way possible:  

I believe that the OKR-friendly, or the MBO-friendly for "refining the language of the objective," happens if the doer does this job after the fact that that output was done. Or more precisely, with key results achieved, after the action and effort put in place, the generated data, and the information, happens to support the doer to consider the reflection with the horizon in hindsight; thus aiming for the opportunity. This, in mathematical terms, would be about considering that the refinement of the objective is a function of key results:

> RO = f ( KR )

Where the achieved key results is a function of the Objective:

> KR = f ( O )

Therefore, New key results comes as a function of the work of refining the language of the objective:

> NKN = F ( RO )

Now, viewing from that angle might suggest the very idea of the of a more steady pace which is just about going or the good. In other words, the judgement of the effort can only happen after the fact of a clearly stated effort given by the clearly acomplished key results. The opportunity for a good refining starts with, first, the observationof that has happened, and from that it follows a reflection of what is going on - such as through interactions of the team talking about it - which takes them to come up with with new ideas and concepts which likely forms the new cycle [^footnote_kolb_learning].

[^footnote_kolb_learning]: This viewpoint is given in alignment with *Kolb's Experiential Learning Model*, which emphasizes learning as a cyclical process of experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting. This model, according to the Wikipedia article (2024), consists of four stages: *Concrete Experience*, *Reflective Observation*, *Abstract Conceptualization*, and *Active Experimentation*.

### Consider when transcending is important 






Now, if learning is key it is still something expected. Now, from the perspective of goal-setting and the managerial activity  of progressing with goals, we should finally be concerned with the situation when the learning is not happening by the situation of doing it; where the team feels that something is wrong, which can happen anyway. 

This situation could be a case when the expected key results - inputs, outputs or outcomes - seem to be right direction but can't be reached. This situation could be compared with what Michael (2019) has described as "When the gears of general management grind, companies and founding teams burn through their spiritual and financial runway faster than necessary;" and illustrated with the situation of McCallum from the mid 1800s:

> *"McCallum’s biggest problem at the railroad was cost per mile. As fast as the railroad grew in size, operating costs somehow grew faster. Communication, coordination, operations and sales all became way more difficult, not less so, as the railroad grew. For McCallum, this productivity problem was really a general management problem."* (Dearing, 2019)

Back to the future of our days and considering a situation of a startup team, they might find themselves in a situation of insolvency for advancing what is expected for their key results. This happens if the doers find themselves in an unhealthy condition where they perform their expected activities but what they have commited takes them to become anxious or to start to decide and engage with new kinds of decisions - even arbitrary ones - that increases costs while doesn't advance them towards the expected milestones anyway; or even if it does it does so by adding costs or other measure of undesired impact to them or other areas. 

When McCallum caught himself in the leadership position of the managerial role, he caught himself struggling after he realized that the means he had considered to advance wouldn't scale and bring the milestones. In Michael's words, he "had been taught to engineer and build bridges, not manage thousands of people across half a continent."

The managerial response from him came about as a letter where he had outlined five key challenges where it can be observable that he were involved in measuring other aspects which were consistent with a perspective of the health of his teams: 

* How do you get a group of people to work together towards common goals?
* How do you give people the right about of responsibility?
* How do you make sure the job actually gets done?
* How do you know how things are going along the way?
* How do you do all this with respect for others?

And as a manager he started to monitor these aspects by scoring: 

> *"McCallum also accidentally gave us a beautiful scorecard for modern general managers. Take a look at the picture above. I put McCallum’s Five Challenges down one column. Group works together on common goals, people have the right amount of responsibility, team gets the job done, general manager knows how things are going along the way and people feel respected. In that second column, write a score for your own team."* (Dearing, 2019)

<!--

Dearing, M. (2019, July 2). Thank you, Daniel McCallum. Retrieved from https://medium.com/@mcgd/thank-you-daniel-mccallum-133d27e98468
--> 

For me, the situation of McCallum as illustrated by Michael Dearing, helped me to think of the many situations when we think that we know how to get things done but in the end we might be into a situation that we will need new management and models; to break many of our assumptions. The situation of McCallum - of having no management books - is not different from the modern situation when the management playbooks as seen just don't work anymore: 

> *"Many talented people in Silicon Valley are in McCallum’s shoes. They’ve risen rapidly in their career because they were great at their jobs, because the company was growing like crazy, or most likely, both. They’re getting shoved into leadership and management roles and they’re struggling."* (Dearing, 2019)

So it is inescabable that there are situations where the certainty for how to do things leads to insolvency which is the impossibility for the milestones to happen as the team advances. This situation happens with a great deal of connection with the matter, the challenge, the subject, the theme, or the domain of the problem - callinng whatever you want and asks for the re-evaluation and even in a way the creative destruction of the means of management that had defined the expected key results in the first place as the way to do things are not applicable anymore.  

Another way to look at this situation is to consider the other side of this coin where teams have things to do and the objective as stated by their mission it too ambitious and can't be done in linear (or commited) ways. Imagine that their OKR shows an ambitous goal with the probability of achieving as 60%. It is not uncommon for teams to get away and even to come up with something totally new, to come up with new systems or ideas such as they saw something new, in ways that they not only hit their objectives but break the linear expected logic for getting things done which they thought to be the case. Now, it is not alarming that we generally do not worry about this situation - such as involved in a post-mortem for their now-outdated management approach  - as the team gets quite excited by celebrating and busy by taking advantage from their new approach. But it still concerning anyway from a managerial situation that many teams just move on with an approach for getting things done that seems to be like gambling.
