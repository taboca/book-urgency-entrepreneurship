When the entrepreneurial function happens to creatively destroy the old and change  reality it does so more by getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone] and less because of theory, fiction, inventions, and other required arrangements to thrive. Focusing on the worker - call them doers, executors, entrepreneurs - right after they put their helmet on and set themselves in the trajectory, immediately they visualize that if they want to get things done back home they can't just be doing things, like getting arbitrary things done. In other words, the doers go far but they do so by calling ground control - by setting goals and an incessant fear of being drifters in the space of opportunities.

[^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned  Austrian-American economist and political scientist known for his theories on economic development and business cycles, in "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," emphasizes the characterization of "getting things done" (p. 132) as an essential element of the entrepreneurial function. He argues this aspect is even more crucial than others, such as the entrepreneur's ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive.

Now, if we focus in the startup situation, the theme of management by objectives is likely to appear not only to respond to these internal needs do things productively but because the growth needs adds complexity - more people and more viewpoints and more differences and therefore more necessary to get involved with figuring how each one can contribute. This notion was confirmed by a survey conducted by Michael Dearing - of Harrison Metal - where he asked about 250 top workers of high-growth organizations, and confirmed that they value the clarity of communications in terms of goals and for how to get there, in addition to their confirmation for how this reflects their perception about the quality of management [^foonote_michaeldearing_clearobjectives]. 

[^foonote_michaeldearing_clearobjectives]: Michael Dearing discusses the importance of understanding top priorities in high-growth companies in his course 'Self Study GM2: Setting Objectives & Measuring Performance.' In this course, Dearing surveyed 250 people working in high-growth companies about the clarity of top priorities and the quality of team management. He found that 70% of respondents confirmed that understanding top priorities was extremely important. Source: Dearing, M. (n.d.). Self Study GM2: Setting Objectives & Measuring Performance.

> *"To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct economic function, first, because they lie outside routine tasks which everybody understands, and secondly, because the environment resists in many ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions with the enterprise exploit. It consists in getting things done."* (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

Now, if looking to that horizon rings a bell for what is ahead it isn't entirely enough for early doers to - let me put it that way - be distracted from the actual challenges of the day which may feel like "jumping off a cliff trying to assemble an airplane on their way down," [^footnote_reidhoffman_airplane_cliff] as vividly said by Reid Hoffman. In other words, the actual call we make to ground control sets us in what is major - to do what needs to be done first and then, afterwards, come back to organize things such as sorting out post-its as part of the reflection [^footnote_michaeldearing_realdoing_postits] and organizational work. 

[^footnote_reidhoffman_airplane_cliff]: In discussing the nature of startups, Reid Hoffman celebrates the metaphor where in the startup situation "you throw yourself off a cliff and you assemble an airplane on the way down," (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2013) to vividly note about the challenges such as the mortality situation and of focusing.

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Complication - We struggle with the thing in the middle, the execution; We may doubt that a method for progressing with goals helps for when the urgencies are real. 
--> 

But the complication remains - that given the ongoing conversation of management by objectives is alive, these managers of objectives can be uncomfortable with the theme - even to a point of doubting these ideas for managing goals and progress, or deferring to later as if it is something that can be used in the right time, such after more traction exists or the team is bigger. In other words, in our hurry to improve our "how should I contribute best?" and living the pressures of the current, they feel that the more formal involvement with the theme can be a distraction or the very waste of resources which is unproductive under the latent desire to achieve further goals. We might even get mad because solutions are told and promoted in coherent ways - promoting that it solves - but early involvement and consideration for its potential applicability does not suit the reality. 

If these aren’t enough of a problem, a deeper involvement with the ongoing conversations - even from experienced and grown up entrepreneurs - won’t hide many challenges and implications. As an example, consider the view given by Fried and Hansson (2018, p. 32) in "Making it up as you go," and their testimonial of how they run Basecamp quite well by denying the ideas of strong goals such as the 2, 3, or even 5-year plans:

> *"Every six weeks or so, we decide what we will be working on next. And that is the only plan we have. Anything further out is considered a 'maybe, we will see.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 32).

<!--

Furthermore they give us a good supporting point for how to be driven by an orientation of strict and strong goals can be detrimental to genuine progress: 

> *"Much corporate anxiety comes from the realization that the company has been doing the wrong thing, but it is too late to change the direction because of the 'Plan.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33)

--> 

So, here we set ourselves in a dilemma where we are engaged and concerned with productivity, to do our best towards our objectives, but equally concerned  with the aspects when the whole system of measurement influences everything. A potential question is: Is it worth to get involved with learning about management by objectives or to get involved with communications about goal setting and goal progressing? And if so, when?

Our answer is yes and the when can be dropped because if you are into anything that has objectives, you already started it and you are already using your time and energy. But a reframing to the question in alignment with the style of this book is: Is there a way to reflect on the subject of goal setting and goal progressing that is applicable in the beginning and can be lasting?

And through that viewpoint, we will move on not like a playbook, or a set of rules that you are required to follow up through with many iterations for stages, and required to become an expert for something that by the time you hit specific necessities you don't even know anymore the details or need to out of the sudden access that expert.

But we will use OKR - one popular framework being used by high-growth organizations - as a guide to an actual conversation, a reflection. With that, we aren't pressured to keep thinking of matching the elements of the framework for the situations of our startup; but in fact reflecting on the actual fundamental challenges and checking if the framework recognizes them and if the ongoing conversations about the framework discusses them. Using OKR as a guide is here first because it is popular because it's being used effectively, because it's being misused, because like many of the modern "solutions in the hypermarket of entrepreneurship," people can sometimes pick it quickly and start to use it just like their organize their efforts, under pressure, under anxiety, which sets them to be quite frustrated.

We will begin by analyzing why OKRs starts with the premise that objectives should be strong, ambitious, and possibly long-term. This includes recognizing the potential problems of this approach, questioning whether it makes sense to start there, and how discussions about OKRs deal with the probable lack of flexibility. Following this, we will examine whether OKRs offer elements that assist in course correction in a healthy manner, given that the nature of entrepreneurship involves uncertain paths and the pursuit of innovation that requires learning. Finally, we will consider complications and confusions that exist and are part of the broader discussion, such as problems where the measurement and judgment of progress end up influencing execution; and how to deal with a measurement and judgment approach that is not so radical, and that actually helps the team operate better.

--> 

Why is it that when a young worker enters an existing organization they find that top-down goals to be so impactful to their lives as contributors? And I don't mean impactful as seen through the pupils of the executives that mostly deploy them to be outcome-oriented - or driven to their top-down goals. 

But impactful to the these doers in ways that brings tears from their eyes and that drains their creative potential if not their health. Although that can be an extremme, yet it doesn't disconnect from point from the Basecamp founders - that state of anxiety - where the doers are harmed and with that the impact turns out to be the lower performance to the organization. But even if tears aren't seen, it is still inescapable their concerns about the possibility of a harsh and rigid blind need for achieving the top-down goals connects with the bad old days - where outcome were all that matters in the eyes of the self-called masters and that didn't see people more than a effort-deploying units that happens to walk and talk. 

With that, naturally, the modern and young doer may well be conspiring a revolt with that managerial style. But sadly that revolt isn't real in anyone's todo list and not present as a reflection too - they don't have time and energy for that. But it is present anyway by that increased anxiety, or as frustrations, but moreover and sadly it has the power to set them to deny, or at minimum to not be excited with, much about what management has leaned and told in the subject of managing progress with goals. It might be even worse that ahead some of the survivals this work scene become the ones responsible to set goals too - or to become founders - and finally get to be in a position to hire and recruit others; and even if they don't do it in that ancient and brutal old ways, they still can't figure much what to do except to set  top-down expectations, set expected outcomes, and hope that their subordinates can do it. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k1.0.3 -   Question-answer - Through OKR, we can reflect on the core aspects that brings anxiety and how achieving goal is challenging and needs a top-down vs bottom-up collaboration.  
--> 

If we hold the position that a longer plan is valid, or meaningful, and required. This view recognizes that people get to do things because of their connection with what has to be done. This also aligns with the startup situation where there is a prior movement exists before getting things ready, before action, such as the precursor movement from inspiration, from having a viewpoint about something that needs to be changed. In other words, it may be overlooked that a strong objective exists - especially when organizations are already running driven by so clear stronger objectives. Now, with that in sight, we are also seeking a way for our management of progress to recognize and reconciliate the top-down goals with the realities of the doers, which in the view of OKR this recogniztion happens through bottoms-up analysis. 

Let us then briefly cover the historical perspective about goal-setting and management of goals and how the urgencies of its execution sets the very top-down goals that oftenly appears harshly upon us. With that, we will contrast with the other side, the bottoms-up reality of the doers which also requires the management of the self as we are trying to figure our contribution in a setting such as a team or a unit of work. With these two perspectives, we will introduce OKR although in alignment with our strategy which is less of a playbook and more intended to poke into the OKR conversation to see how it deals with these perspectives.

What appeas from the historical perspective, the flight from above, is that the science of management of goals is evolving and acknowledges the hard reality and the flexible viewpoint that is necessary to support doers to achieve goals. According to Stephen Covey, from 7 Habits of Successful People, the historical development and of management of priorities exists. Peter Drucker, in Managing Oneself, also had acknowledged that the workers had to work in what was told to them but they had entered in a stage to consider that they could be arbitrary.

--> 


Thiis is where OKR can be more properly introduced in the context of that wider goal-setting and management of goals context. Before anything, and in alignment with this view from perspective, we should acknowledge that OKR was recently popularized by the championing work of John Doerr [^footnote_johndoerr_okr] , through the evangelism work where he pushed the movement further inside Google, and through the book entitled *Measure What Matters*, where the discussion continues to evolve. After the work, and through the WhatsMatters side [^foonote_whatmatters_site] and other resources such as the What Matters course [^footnote_whatmatters_course], one can see part of a wider movement which is occupied with testing, experimenting, learning, and evolving the conversation. 

[^footnote_johndoerr_okr]: John Doerr, a renowned venture capitalist, has been a vocal advocate for the framework of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) which he discusses in his book *Measure What Matters*. He learned much about this methodology directly from Andy Grove during his time at Intel. 

[^foonote_whatmatters_site]: 

[^footnote_whatmatters_course]: 

The popular OKR, objectives and key resources, is at this point recognized as a framework. According to John Doerr, we can see how it became used at Google from the beginning - and important to note is that it survived what could be seen as a chaotiocally smart space of the top-tier Silicon Valley companies that we oftenly be so proud of being chaotic. Of course, that chaotic space is a reflection and observation of spaces where the best ideas can put a dent in the universe of the status-quo. But John has put it in written form - it survived the Google test which maybe not the best test in the world - not the most creative company - but still is good enough to indicate that the framework, and the ideas behind are not nonsensical: 

> *""* John Doerr, Measure What Matters 

Beyond that, and according to John too, the experience at Google wasn't the start; as he revealed the origins being a work that Andy Grove - while he was the CEO of intel - was championing and properly written as management by objectives. John had the opportunity to learn directly from Andy what was at the time the evolution of another conversation which was pushed by Peter Drucker: 

> *""* Andy Grove, High Output Management 

From these observations, it is also inescapable the idea that OKR - or management by objectives - were developed in the high-growth space of companies that had a market, or market-fit, and had to execute and at the same time deal with new people being hired, people that needed to figure what they could do best and managers concerned with that, and with the corporate expectations that workers were there to improve themselves into their best conditions to support the company goals. 

With that said, the construction of OKR through the days of Andy Grove had to face the concerns that the doers were not mere servants, that they had their identities and their views; not purely from any inclination of humaninistic perspective (which would likely be expected from a mind like Andy Grove) but also because Intel happened to go through hard times where Andy noticed that the middle in-the-middle, real workers such as middle managers, were the ones in the position to save the company from trouble, such as of major trouble of a major ship that goes only in the direction of the top-down major objectives that if continuing the movement so blindly would simple and innevitably hit the catastrophic - like a titanic - outcome of sinking the whole ship. In other words, Andy were concerned with the strong winds, or strong forces, of the external market that could make a heavy and big ship even one going in a direction of certainty to sink. IN the book, Only the Paranoid Survive, Andy elaborates how Intel were moving in a direction and were quite sudden caught in the middle of the 10x force - when the competition from the the Japanese would likely sink Intel as the Japanese had a new technolgy much better -  and how they had to struggle to figure, or to be sensitive, to the data that happen to be felt by the people in the middle of the field - like the salespeople, middle managers: 

> *""* Andy Grove, Only the Paranoide Survive 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - answer k1.1.2.1 - Top-down of OKR is not ignorant to learning  
--> 

These ilustrations, of the hard days of these managers, are good for us to have a sense of the how OKR happened to be constructed. Can a company that is in high-growth, and strong, that needs to set goals and expectations to its workers, keep a system that enables them to not follow so blindly? In other words, OKR starts yes with the top-down goals and expectations, it wants it to be real and meangful - and it is okay with the driving goal of 2 years. But equaly balanced is the view that is bundle within - that without it one would read the following like a super strict and harsh reason to be disciplined with the goals as in written in stone; but not, the nuanced view there is more: 

> *"An effective goal setting system starts with disciplined thinking at the top, with leaders who invest the time and energy to choose what counts."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)

In other words, one will not need to dig much to see that the disciplined thinking is at the top, not a disciplined following that is blidnly by the doers - any subordinate being assigned to their duty. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - answer k1.1.2.3 - OKR reflects on risks? 
--> 

Consider the concern of the OKR crew, pointed from the Coursera from Measure What Matters, where they have stated the quote from John Doerr: "In Measure What Matters, John Doerr says, "The more ambitious the OKR, the greater the risk of overlooking a vital criterion. "

<!--
@meta @todo 
* @todo p2 ( ) - In Not so Radical Focus - Check the quote from Measure What Matters coursera course, which is private, so we may need to go dig for the actual quote from the Measure What Matters book - Ref from Coursera is: "In Measure What Matters, John Doerr says, "The more ambitious the OKR, the greater the risk of overlooking a vital criterion. "". @refid-whatsapp 23479 @refid 3298-9484-8483-9943 
--> 

There is nothing in OKR, to summarize this notion and call to keep the top-down alive, that wants to set the whole ship to miss understanding of what is going on, and to ignore the vital force, the doers in the middle. 

#### What should I contribute? 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k1.2 - Goals might be inherently part of - the contribution   
--> 

But in a way or another sometimes, it appears a fight; as in on one side there is the one that tells and on the other side the doers; but our point is not that we need to see this fight as in from the perspective of the old harsh days and even historical situation of the master expecting is just a so alarming that confuses us. 

The fight happens in the micro context, a small team even of friends working, and the fight also happens within the micro context of the individual. If we lock in the reality of the innevitable that goals are here to say, like it or not, and that achieving them goals will be hard, like it or not, we will only have to face the reality that we as managers have to nurture the environment for them to be achieved because the doer can only do one thing - to contribute. And if we are wearig this hat, we are into the need to comply with the understanding of what should my contribution be.

--> 

Thereore, we can't deny that the subject of goals connects with motivation and meaning. In other words, the reason that goals matters have also to do with our roles in it. We should note that people join causes to work on them for a while and the meaning might also break down in terms of expectations for what can be done (what we are doing) and how things can be done (how are doing). People evaluate themselves against their goals. 

Therefore, it is not unwise to consider that, for teams and as teams unfold, the existence of a goals create a condition for them not only to join, due to motivations and interest in the outcome, but to engage in a movement where they seek to identify how they can contribute. In the "What Should I Contribute?" section of Managing Oneself, Peter Drucker (2008) recognized an extreme situation of when one is being told what to do, one one hand which certainly is not appropriate in modern management, and, on the other hand, the response inclination of "do your own thing." However, he concludes that the inclination to doing one's own thing doesn't suffice when striving to contribute, achieve self-fulfillment, and find success (pp. 53-54).

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* reference - Drucker, P. (2008). Managing Oneself. Harvard Business School Press. pp. 53-54. 
--> 

We should account here that John Doerr is known as the evangelist of OKR as a framework, a work he started at Google. As he has recognized in *Measure What Matters*, the framework was given to him by Andy Grove while he worked at Intel. In addition, Andy has credited that he improved his Objectives and Key Results with learnings from Peter Drucker. Therefore, it is not unwise to consider that the willingness for one to contribute, in an organization, has ties with the effort to manage oneself. Peter has elaborated a contribution for the individual version of it: 

> *"What should my contribution be? To answer it, it must address three distinct elements. What does the situation require? Given my strenghts, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference."* (Drucker, Peter. 2008. pp. 35)

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* reference - Drucker, P. (2008). Managing Oneself. Harvard Business School Press. pp. 53-54. 
--> 

> *"Leaders must get across the *why* as much as the *what*. Their people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)




Thus it is uncommon for people to join projects, with causes and goals, as they know that their strenghts can be used for the situation that needs to be changed. And, as they feel that they can do something. Likewise, the structure of a goal-setting project, such as one having a clear documentation and expected results to favor the goal, is likely used by founders as they have to communicate round and improve their chances towards success.







Therefore, it is not unwise to notice how we gravitate towards having a plan, an outcome ahead, and even a 2-year plan, as a key element that may put us in a position to solve what is needed to be solved. Plus there seesm to exist an alignment with the too many stories, as told, that we have seen, and read, and watched, and continue to witness; the too many examples of people that told that they were doing something as in to change the world and they did. Plus, if one feels that goal-setting in the corporate is more like a storytelling that fails, with lots of traps (and it does have), and as they dig, they will find an entire field of research related to goal-setting. But if we dig, it is undeniable that out of goal-setting, and after goal-setting, we can find that the reason for the whole field has to do with how we react, how we fix ourselves, as we go. We can't deny that the environment created by a goal-setting system has the good intention to shape us towards progress, even when progress is yet to be discovered in the innovation space. 

There is the minimal unit of work for a goal which means "working for a goal" and can and should be honored. This is about showing up. Of course, no one wants to show up in ways that we burn resources but the very showing up and considering the best way possible, should then set us to discover the how should I contribute that is better, which is a good opening to the next section. This openning, that avoids the arbitrary movement, starts with having more time such as time to reflect. If you use your scarce resources, if you split time, you are making things harder in a way. And if you use wisely this time crack which takes the time you are doing - such as in arbitrary ways - you are then reflecting. And if you are doing so and considering how to do better, then you are acknowleding the possible better use of time. Thus goals vs. how should I contribute is a good start, a frame of reference, such as to set us in the direction of the next section.

BUt likewise with the concerns, these are there in ways that the doer is real, a contributor, and not following blindly. The opportunity is for understanding the best work possible and also reading from the data, the real information that is applicable to the context.

Now, from the more peaceful space between the role of the one that wants the top-down, against the role of the one that tries to be a contribor, the health dynamics is not only the only thing to do, and necessary but also when explored will be the space for the actual opportunity - and we will come to  recognize that in most of the situations we do not have clarity about how we phrased our top-down goals too - and that the actual work of doing it is the work that gives light to the path. Let's move on to see how that opportunity to course-correct goals happens and how OKR supports that too.

## OKR analysis for Course-correction, failure, and opportunity 

<!-- 
@meta @value
* 3 stars - anxiety 
* 3 stars - blocked and locked 
--> 

When it comes to translating objectives into actions, taken that we start from the wishes, the target, the top top, a top-down modelling effort is put in place - indeed based on a big goal, whiten down as an objective. The modelling phase is part of the planning process intended to find things that we can do that can bring that objective closer. 

The other component of it has to do with the Key Results which is how the team moves to pull the goal closer. There is no doubt that OKR aims for achieving the objectives. In other words, the objective that is writen down is not to change. And that creates the condition for the performer to focus and work in the key results. 


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.2 - intro - complication - 
--> 

The natural question, or complication with that idea, is exactly that it pulls the team towards being locked by the requirements of the goals and key results, which indeed could cause anxiety when the performer feels that things are not going well. Worse it is when, in the face of the feeling that things are not going well, the performer is pressured to work even more towards pre-defined key results, as if assuming that more effort would save the strategy. And, of course, when the matter involves the outcome not serving well, more anxiety certainly comes our way. 

But then, with that idea, it is time to consider if OKR passes the complication pointed by David and Jason, who stated: 

> *"the sooner you admit you have no idea what the world will look like in five years, three years, or even one year, the sooner you will be able to move forward without the fear of making the wrong big decision years in advance."* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33).

Indeed, when working with innovative products, in a world that changes fast, that sounds about the situation that many founders live. It might come a situation of conflict when the findings pull the team to reconsider but in fact they feel that they cannot change direction, cannot be creative, or even when the team looses interest because things are too mechanical in the face of, as indicated, corporate anxiety. The situation becomes confusion as the required goal can create confusion in the face of other elements that are essential for the ones actually working, such as the things that comes after the question that Peter Drucker brought up: how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.2 - intro - question - 
--> 

Therefore, it is justifiable to question if OKR has mechanisms in place that supports teams to evaluate and course-correct what they do, as they go. In this direction, it is important to note that as much as OKR exists to help with pulling the objectives closer, OKR is also promoted as a framework that supports evaluation, which is primarily driven by the evaluation of the key results, as key results are executed, which consequently creates an opportunity for objectives to be evaluated, first against key results, but also in the face of the existing strategy or higher objectives. 


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.2 - intro - answer - 
--> 

Does OKR supports the possibility that objectives and the key results are not well designed - we working in a bad direction? Not only so, but it's necessary mechanism to support the growth, transcending, learning, moving on. 

With that problem ahead of us, let us continue to investigate if OKR has course-correction that supports learning and evalution of the goals. The short answer is yes, although we have to acknowlege how difficult it is to use a goal-setting system that seems to offer an escape hatch for escaping the ship such as change the plan on the go.

* Outline - Answer k2.1 - Collaboration aspect of OKR - transparency of key results 
--> 

Consider an OKR that started with an initial objective, such as an objective that was created ahead of any work, such as one that comes from a mission or a vision. It does so with the purpose of pushing the design process of OKR into the modelling, or planning, for the steps that are thought to be steps that pulls the objective closer. 

This part, the Key Results part of OKR, appears first as a mechanism to keep track, that adds transparency, and which reveals what is being done and what is ahead. In additin, it is also a mechanism that offers a window of opportunity to see what goes on and how what is being done connects with where we want to go. Here is where OKR starts to get complicated as, in essence, it's becomes a collaboration mechanism. What I mean by complicated is that much more simpler to simply use OKR for tracking, as in a stream that goes to one direction, than for enabling it as a collaborative communication tool that allows teams to evaluate what they do, to change what they are tracking, if not to chage what they are going after. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.1.1 - Collaboration aspect of OKR  - and case of a book writing 
--> 

Through a case of writing we can see how the mechanis of using key results can be powerful, and where we establish the minimal effort with a maximum impact, through honoring the collaborative process that take place, transparently, honestly. The upfront "daring" accomodation of key results with the open mindset to evaluate is the key. 

First looking at the simpler dimention of OKR, consider when one said that she is to write a book. She expects to deliver pages, or chapters, or to do a number of interviews, to come up with the articles, and to engage in several processes that would bring the objective closer. OKR asks her to pick a few key results that she believes will help. Although OKR doesn't go into strategy, what to pick, it proposes a system where the discussion happens, even for one working alone. If you write it down, and if you set your objectives, and if you set your key results, then you are writing it for the sake of letting collaboration to take place; so that you know, so that you can read, so that you can reflect. Therefore, it is less for the sake of presenting or keeping the score, or for serving as a personal grading for what was performed. It is, instead, for the sake of openning a window, a way to see, a way to talk, a discussin to happen, about the said, or written, key results; as as well the objective since it is all interconnected. With the communication going on, she can run the evaluation cycle and change her OKR for the next cycle. 

This collaborative aspect of OKR, used by organizations that reportedly does well, consider that some of them require individuals to post their OKRs, to share. This situation takes a great culture and great effort in the first place. They report benefits such as when an employee, by knowing what other employee is doing, can offer help indirectly such as to give hints, advices, and new ideas. Moreover, the essence of this is that the doer is okay in the doing of it, even in the early stages, even when mistakes are apparent.

* Outline - Answer k2.1.2 - Course correct - internal market starts with honesty and transparency
--> 

> ".................." 

When exposing what we do, the things we are doing, and letting others chime in to help, even people that are not connected directly, it is natural to consider that the mechanism promotes communication and open ideas to flow in which would result in an opportunity to reduce self bias and improve not only effectiveness, in the sense of performance for what is being done and in the sense of the simpler nature of accounting and tracking, but also taken that this simpler factor is present, the more complex collaborative communication which is the opportunity to evaluate all that is being done. 

Consider that the point about transparency and collaboration has to do not with the benefits like gambling, of one helping with the other, as if people have the clicks, that is a by-product of doing in a collaborative and transparency way. But in addition to that, it is important to recognize that transparency, having things written down, also reveals failure in the eyes of everyone, which could be complicated depending on the effects from the exposure of failure, such as if the protagonists of the failed propositions aren't to be valued. Therefore, in other words, the exposure goes along with the necessity of the right attitude, a system of protection which when exists gains a strategic meaning, as indicated by Michael Dearing, gains a tone of competition, a healthy competition: 

> *"It seems to me that the best product roadmaps come from vigorous internal competition for time and talent from engineering, design, marketing. " Michael Dearing (2016)

The point suggested by Micheal was isnpired from the general point about competition in macro markets (2016) - the situation and acknowledgement that competition drives better results with the rise of the winning competitor. But then, deriving from that, it comes the natural question if any of that is the actual mechanism we use when we come up with a better thing to do in the face of our goals. Perhaps Michael saw the whole world as a one big company which is the analogy for the intercal micro market and the notion of competition. In this model, consider that there is the input of doing, from doing, from vision, from brainstorming, first in the beginning of a process like a funnel. And then, a quantitative and qualitative judgement chimes in which separates the gold from the things that we can separate, as in the data to support recyling it. 

But a quite important aspect of it has to do with the need for transparency and exposure. "Put the roadmap where everyone can see it is one of the most powerful actions a founder can take." (2016) which goes along with " It is to be expected that people who care about what they work on are disappointed when something doesn’t work out the way they wanted. The approach above arms them with the information they need to make sense of the disappointment and to improve the probability that their next ideas will get funded." (2016)

Notice that in the illustration he created the idea of "funded" can be interpreted as approved or the general idea of buy-in.

It is valid to assert that OKR, as a framework, promotes the effort of colloration that involves, checking, evaluating, and changing direction. Consider, for example, another aspect of OKR where Key Results - as promoted by the viewpoint of John Doerr - can be defined as aspirational or commitment based. These approaches exist to accommodate the situations where a lot of learning, such as discovery, is involved - commitment based key results offers an approach to check progress for the moments that we know exactly what needs to be done. Again, the applicability and value from it depends on the strategic planning. 

But the evaluation of the what happens, according to the approach, is key and should be likely done at all times. Not only after the fact that when done properly communication and contributions happens indirectly as indicated. The natural execution of it requires constant evaluation that involves self review and peer review, such as a review with a manager. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.2. - Course correct - Allowing the editor-critic - complication - 
--> 

Of course, depending on the culture, toxic aspects can come the way to influence the process to offer no value. For example, depending on how the measurement of performance of an employee is done, such as when the compensation is associated with the Key Results and moving towards the Objective as written, then the results can be catrastrofic. Would one want to course correct its path, after having good reasons for so, after knowing that she or he could be evaluated as bad performer and even get fired? That kind of situation would certainly bring anxiety and a lot of distractions for a call that would not likely happen. 

It is important to pause here and reflect that a lot of companies indeed enters that mode. They set goals in stone, they put prizes for the ones that follows the path as written, they punish the ones that didn't do well. Then it comes the question, do they course correct? Yes but they do that in macro terms, by facing a crisis, which likely involve getting people fired, managers fired, teams reorganized. From the point of view of an employee, under a whole team that got fired for moving in the bad direction claiming it was good, the employee generally tries to escape the spiral of death by reclaiming that he was told to do that job and was performing well. In a lot of situations like that, a lot of people can get away. But still, anxiety was present and a lot of effort to manage the crisis which can and should be considered a bad use of the time of people. 

Therefore, it is ideal to think that a plan for progressing is not about a plan for evaluating people - as in to consider them in or out the boat. This is a key aspect of the OKR approach that when well considered can make OKR become a useful tool and one that also serves well for course-correcting and actually bringing everyone on board and focusing on what matters. 

With a cadence for evaluating what is being done, with allowance for reviewing with transparency and strategic thinking too, the approach can help person to change the plan at the level of the Key Results and also Objectives.

--> 

The effort of redoing the OKR hundreds of times, is for the sake of being open. Now, in this regard, a question that comes is if OKR does not allow room for bottom-up contributions that affects the top-down. Part of it I have covered, the conversation is there. But the cycle for reviewing all the top down plan exists too and bottom-up contributions is recognized as key. In other words, the approach needs and depends on the confrontation of the what we want to do with the what is happening. Of course, the cadence for that sort of strategic planning work might have a cadence, needs a cadence applicable to the organization.

## Outcome vs. Output War and Peace 


There are situations that people enter the OKR train is valid, as it stops beautifully on time in the station. It’s a trip with a goal, such as to learn and use OKR in the best way possible. But then we enter in it, the wagon starts smooth and the scenery is beautiful, it’s unbelievable and the roadmap seem to make sense with scenes around. But then, give it some time and housing passing by. Suddenly the lights of the train blinks arbitrarily and we hear something craking as the speed of the train increases fast. A yellow light fades under the seat and people start to be worried. Next stop, unknown, the train enters a tunel, the heater stops working, and it goes on for another 2 hours with the speed increasing. What is next will blow your mind. You can't go back to revisit the trip. You are on it and it is going of the tracks. This is where you start to lose faith in your OKR trip and your training. 

The way that Christina Wodtke puts it in her article - entitled *"Are You Sure You Want to Use OKRs?"* I love it because the actual *Call to Action* calls for a reflection: 

> *"There is a concept I call drift. Drift means that a process has drifted away from the original framing. It happened to Agile. What started as a simple idea that people should work collaboratively and iteratively became people policing each other on the True Agile Way: “this is how to write a user story” and “Stand up can’t be more than 15 minutes long.”"* (Wodtke, 2022)

The complication that I had was that I have identified that OKR learning starts smooth but hits a wall at some point. Not sure if you have seen this but a lot of the OKR articles - and there is a lot of them now trying to help with problems, ambiguities, struggles - sort of gets a bit complicated at a specific point. Things get hard when the learner moves toward the shape/design/model of Key Results. The core of this learning complication, in my opinion, has its epicenter in the Output vs. Outcome discussion.

[1] When John Doerr (and team) launched Measure What Matters, I believe the fight was not there. However, with time, they published their positioning - What Matters: Output vs. outcome with OKRs. https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/outputs-vs-outcome-okr

[2] On the other hand, many product managers (which seems to be the case) are moving their troops using Outcome-oriented thinking. Christina Vodjke, the author of Radical Focus and Stanford Professor, has indicated that Outcome-oriented is better - https://cwodtke.medium.com/you-cant-handle-okrs-5465cf161e81

If you make a key result 'launch this feature' and halfway through the quarter you discover it won’t move the number you hoped it would, you’re stuck.

So I was stuck in my small world, preferring a bit towards Output/action, which gives me a way to judge/evaluate actual action strategy. But yet stuck anyway or unhappy with the complexity in the center of this fight, as I have figured. No articles seemed to address the Outcome vs. Output question in the context of management.



<!--
@meta @outline

* Change this - For OKR, my conclusion would be that the needle, to adjust towards output-based or outcome-based, would depend on what is delivered. For example, if the project in the hands of an individual is very design-oriented where the executor is learning/discovering/stepping into the unknown (old or young), they might consider it output-based. If the project has found direction, then an outcome-based can be handy.

To be fair with Christina, notice that the context may matter. In the above view, she had assummed what she referred as "prep work" which I would then relaltively agree with the idea of key results to have that inclination to outcomes, if you have indeed a crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency: 

> *"Do the prework. Make sure you have a crisp strategy. Make sure your teams have psychological safety. Make sure your product teams are multidisciplinary (Product, Design and Engineering.) Fire bad managers. Adopt Agile and Lean practices. Create as many self-sufficient teams as possible. Value effectiveness over efficiency."* (Wodtke, 2022)

So up to here, I had identified the complication in the learning journey of a founder.Moving towards the potential answer, the following author gave us a cartoon to help us understand Output vs. Outcome, although he promotes Outcome-based for OKR:+ Cartoon is [Resouces -> Activites -> Output -> Outcome -> Impact]https://medium.com/@jseiden/to-write-better-okrs-use-outcomes-e82be6e7b460

The effect of the above writing (and similar thinking) has, IMHO, provoked What Matters folks to position a response:+ Output vs. outcome with OKRs -https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/outputs-vs-outcome-okr

The likely core of the worriness of Christina has to do with the struggle if you are interested in being open about the actual efforts you make. The point of her intention - in my view - has to do with "giving up" a potential challenging part of OKR - to see the output and discuss - and to allow the team to get away, to deal with it. And by the way, the point given in the following interview, she recomments a good brainstorming for the key results design:

#### Recovering the reflective opportunity - The window 

Adjusting Christina's approach to make it work with the output-based, would be about acknowledging first the good intentions in the good not the best: 

>*"The best is the enemy of the good. If you are spending weeks refining the language of the objective and pinning down just the right metrics, your company is in the business of process management. That’s wasteful. Try to make good OKRs but remember there is a time when you have to say, good enough for now. You don’t want to spend three weeks setting your goals and lose the time you could be working toward them instead." (Wodtke, 2022)

But moving forward, the output-based version that is friendly with that can be about the "refining the language of the objective" after the fact that the output is being generated. Or more precisely, the key results being executed, such as action and effort, generates the data, the information, and opportunity. It is the judgement of the effort, a clearly stated effort, that allows the team to do it again, to adjust things. In other words, the adjustment to the key results is the actual opportunity, as we can see, as we can talk about, what is going on. THis is circles back to the points about collaboration from the prior section. 

The idea of using Key Results to quantity success can be dangerous because your objective should be your success. The key results, in the appraoch that is honest and collaborative shall then become the key elements that gives us the opportunity to re-evaluate. The danger of moving straight under the assumption of quantification of success using Key Results [^footnote_christinawodtke_key_results_quantity_success] is that you can miss keep traking of what you are doing, missing the window of opportunity for evaluation, and in the case of weak cultures, this may also become doing things outside the window of what is visible and accountable which is where a lot of people are able to get things done - but there is a price to pay. The price to pay is the inneviable disatisfaction with OKR in general, running with arbitrary investments, the discussions of the real effort and activities happening somewhere else - for example.

The viewpoint given by Reforge is also mature to recognize not only the different kinds of key results but strategic mixing of these kinds to actually improve the deepthness of connection with the purpose, the objectives:

#### Clarity for effort vs. outcome using roles of junior vs. senior 

That shows a complex approach that some of the Mozilla managers had for measuring folks, where "junior people can be measured by effort" while "the outcome can measure senior people."The framing of this last article helped me see correlations with:+ junior/senior+ unknown/known+ divergence/convergence+ aspirational/commitment+ effort/outcomeAnd that helped me to see better that the adjustment of the needle (from action, to output, to outcome) could be done depending on the context of the objective.Therefore, if you don't know much about what you are doing, you can measure by effort and revisit faster (100 times). If you are confident, the measure could be oriented towards an outcome.That could also explain why composed OKR (team level) could be more oriented to outcomes and why an individual could be more oriented to effort. Not sure.

The above blew my mind, my friends. A neuron in a galaxy far away was able to say hi to another neuron in another faraway galaxy.

But it wasn't only that, you kept, in this article, provoking my mind with things such as "who is junior" or "what means junior" or "why?"

Having had a light, I am here pondering one thing as I try to go back to Output vs. Outcome in the context of OKR. Besides the excellent spectrum provided by [3] Seid, this potential addition has to do with the visualization that effort might go along with design/divergent thinking on the one hand. In contrast, the outcome might go along with design/convergent.

As in - open vs. clone

As in - discover vs. execute

As in - aspirational vs. commitment

I do not know if my awakening has a significant flaw, but something seems linear here or structured about the problem.

What matters, really, is that you can be just out of the sudden under a need to flip yourself, to embraced a personality, to model it, to consider the maturity level for that task. In other words, no matter how senior you are, you can be a junior at any time depending on your objectives ahead:

##### Maturation models 

The model which we aim, which especially is the case for startups, is that the roles are dynamic. The "mature" corporate situation has the light for the solution. If you are mature enough to do that, it is then that you are positioning and understand that there is a way to actually push the outcome you want:

> *"Every company needs a set of folks who do understand the context. Who can be held accountable for the right things actually getting done. That’s what executives are for. You are the people who turn strategy into execution. It’s a hard job. It’s why you get a fancy title and a high salary and a team of people. You need to prioritize, spot problems early, adapt and adjust. You need to empower your teams to be creative, but never step so far away that you lose the thread of how they’ll get it done. "* (Nightingale, 2017)

This again aligns with the given "prep work" suggested by Christina, in my rewriting, the  "crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency." (Wodtke, 2022) 

#### If OKR is the roadmap then it's not evaluation of performance 

The idea of not being so hard is exactly about allowing the doer to fail with the key results and reevaluate which key results bring the doer "back into" the promising direction. Now for thre sake of solving the complex question - should I go with outcome or output - and given the point given, we may use, for the sake of the reflection, the advice from the professor of the MWM Course: 

> *"Contribution is not the same as “making your OKRs.” Did this person make smart choices and stay focused on moving the numbers? Did they gain traction? Did they learn what not to do? And not everyone can contribute to OKRs, so you will need something more than “making OKRs” to evaluate them on.*" (Wodtke, 2022)
