When the entrepreneurial function happens to creatively destroy the old and change  reality it does so more by getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone] and less because of theory, fiction, inventions, and other required arrangements to thrive. Focusing on the worker - call them doers, executors, entrepreneurs - right after they put their helmet on and set themselves in the trajectory, immediately they visualize that if they want to get things done back home they can't just be doing things, like getting arbitrary things done. In other words, the doers go far but they do so by calling ground control - by setting goals and an incessant fear of being drifters in the space of opportunities.

[^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter (2008), the renowned  Austrian-American economist and political scientist known for his theories on economic development and business cycles, in "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," emphasizes the characterization of "getting things done" (p. 132) as an essential element of the entrepreneurial function. He argues this aspect is even more crucial than others, such as the entrepreneur's ability to invent new things or create conditions for the enterprise to thrive.

Now, if we focus in the startup situation, the theme of management by objectives is likely to appear not only to respond to these internal needs do things productively but because the growth needs adds complexity - more people and more viewpoints and more differences and therefore more necessary to get involved with figuring how each one can contribute. This notion was confirmed by a survey conducted by Michael Dearing - of Harrison Metal - where he asked about 250 top workers of high-growth organizations, and confirmed that they value the clarity of communications in terms of goals and for how to get there, in addition to their confirmation for how this reflects their perception about the quality of management [^foonote_michaeldearing_clearobjectives]. 

[^foonote_michaeldearing_clearobjectives]: Michael Dearing discusses the importance of understanding top priorities in high-growth companies in his course 'Self Study GM2: Setting Objectives & Measuring Performance.' In this course, Dearing surveyed 250 people working in high-growth companies about the clarity of top priorities and the quality of team management. He found that 70% of respondents confirmed that understanding top priorities was extremely important. Source: Dearing, M. (n.d.). Self Study GM2: Setting Objectives & Measuring Performance.

> *"To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct economic function, first, because they lie outside routine tasks which everybody understands, and secondly, because the environment resists in many ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions with the enterprise exploit. It consists in getting things done."* (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

Now, if looking to that horizon rings a bell for what is ahead it isn't entirely enough for early doers to - let me put it that way - be distracted from the actual challenges of the day which may feel like "jumping off a cliff trying to assemble an airplane on their way down," [^footnote_reidhoffman_airplane_cliff] as vividly said by Reid Hoffman. In other words, the actual call we make to ground control sets us in what is major - to do what needs to be done first and then, afterwards, come back to organize things such as sorting out post-its as part of the reflection [^footnote_michaeldearing_realdoing_postits] and organizational work. 

[^footnote_reidhoffman_airplane_cliff]: In discussing the nature of startups, Reid Hoffman celebrates the metaphor where in the startup situation "you throw yourself off a cliff and you assemble an airplane on the way down," (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2013) to vividly note about the challenges such as the mortality situation and of focusing.

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Complication - We struggle with the thing in the middle, the execution; We may doubt that a method for progressing with goals helps for when the urgencies are real. 
--> 

But the complication remains - that given the ongoing conversation of management by objectives is alive, these managers of objectives can be uncomfortable with the theme - even to a point of doubting these ideas for managing goals and progress, or deferring to later as if it is something that can be used in the right time, such after more traction exists or the team is bigger. In other words, in our hurry to improve our "how should I contribute best?" and living the pressures of the current, they feel that the more formal involvement with the theme can be a distraction or the very waste of resources which is unproductive under the latent desire to achieve further goals. We might even get mad because solutions are told and promoted in coherent ways - promoting that it solves - but early involvement and consideration for its potential applicability does not suit the reality. 

If these aren’t enough of a problem, a deeper involvement with the ongoing conversations - even from experienced and grown up entrepreneurs - won’t hide many challenges and implications. As an example, consider the view given by Fried and Hansson (2018, p. 32) in "Making it up as you go," and their testimonial of how they run Basecamp quite well by denying the ideas of strong goals such as the 2, 3, or even 5-year plans:

> *"Every six weeks or so, we decide what we will be working on next. And that is the only plan we have. Anything further out is considered a 'maybe, we will see.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 32).

Furthermore they give us a good supporting point for how to be driven by an orientation of strict and strong goals can be detrimental to genuine progress: 

> *"Much corporate anxiety comes from the realization that the company has been doing the wrong thing, but it is too late to change the direction because of the 'Plan.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33)

So, here we set ourselves in a dilemma where we are engaged and concerned with productivity, to do our best towards our objectives, but equally concerned with the aspects when and why. In other words, is it worth to get involved with learning about goal-setting and goal management and if so When is the right time to consider the applicability of any formal method or framework? 

The short answer for getting involved is yes because you are already involved if you are have any objectives ahead even if you are alone and worse if you are in a team situation. In other words, you already started it, you are using your time and energy and it does not matter if you are alone or with others you are in charge of a tremendous potential for impact.

As for the When question I would reframe in agreement with the terms of our journey: Can we appraoch the subject out of the pressure to implement for now? Thus to be free from the mapping pressures such as how I put this framework piece here on top of my team and set us free to look from far how is it that all of this connects with our lives and the complexities of goal-setting and the management of goals; thus so that we can take something with us that works for now, for our lives, and for the beginning of our teams and someting that can be lasting. 

With that said, in our reflective journey we will ride along with OKR - Objectives and Key Resources - a management framework for goal-setting and progressing with goals. The point for "consulting with OKR" has less to do with introducing the framework and more with joining the ongoing conversations that OKR has given to us. You will see in following sections, there are many elements from OKR that sums up and makes the collective conversation to be interestingly rich. But let us not put the carriage in front of our horses and start honoring the aspect that makes OKR as a conversation, besides being a framework.

--> 

#### OKR as a rich conversation 

As a strategic management approach, OKR originated in Silicon Valley at Intel Corporation and then gained widespread usage through its adoption at Google. In other words, OKR has survived the test of time due to the collective intelligence of many Silicon Valley workers [^footnote_marciogalli_people] and people from around the world. Given that OKR evolved from Intel to Google, we should acknowledge the enormous amount of conversations that took and take place both internally and outside these organizations. An informal survey by Kris Duggan [^footnote_krisduggan_surveyokr] during the talk entitled "Using OKRs to Drive Results aka ‘Secrets to Crushing Your Goals’" provides insight into its range of applicability and popularity:

[^footnote_marciogalli_people]: Based on my experience at Netscape Communications in the early 2000s, our environment consisted of too many creative and intelligent individuals who happened to be developing the future of the Internet, to happened to be using the Internet tools to collaborate, and who happeneed to appear as chaotic by their involvement with the idea of break norms. 

> *"By the way, show of hands, who actually does OKRs right now? OK, about a third of you. And who's thinking about OKRs? OK, a third of you and then a third of you came for the free drinks and dinner, I guess. OKRs are simply a management methodology that helps companies focus their effort on what's important and to do that scales across the organization. I don't think you can be too small to think about OKRs. One or two people in a team, or a group, or a division, or a department, or a company, or up to literally 60, 80, 100 thousand people could do this at scale."* 

[^footnote_krisduggan_surveyokr]: It is important to acknowledge Kris Duggan's deep involvement with OKRs. His company, BetterWorks, provides a tool for setting, tracking, and managing goals via OKRs; and has received investment from John Doerr, a prominent Silicon Valley investor and renowned evangelist of OKRs. 

As we move on with OKR, the good news is that we won't be riding on it while trying to learn how to ride and at the same time being concerned with the roadmap challenges. I say that because OKR can be seen as a temperamental animal where people fall, get hurt, and even give up from not knowing its nature. By reflecting on the subject with OKR in perspective, we will set our focus on the actual underlying temperamental element - the human element - that makes goal-setting and the management of goals so hard. With that, I expect that our reflection to be more like talking the walk, which shall better help us and our colleagues when we are required to go walk the walk or walk the talk in the domain of management of goals. 

Let us start by checking why is it that top-down goals are important, and what OKR tells us about using  strong or ambitious or possibly long-term goals, and the considerations for dealing with goals when the road is uncertain. Moving on, we will check the how management of goals - and OKR along with it - deals with the need for course correction. As for the last section, we will consider the complexities for measuring and the judgment of progress and how the too radical perspective can influence the team's poor judgement.

--> 

Why is it that when a young worker enters an organization they find top-down goals so impactful to their lives? And I don't mean impactful as seen by the eyes of the executives that deploy them expecting from them mostly outcomes; but impactful in ways that brings tears from their eyes, that drains their creative potential if not their health. Although that can be an extremme, yet it doesn't disconnect from point from the Basecamp founders - that state of anxiety - where the doers are harmed and with that the impact turns out to be the lower performance to the organization. But if tears can't be seen, still it drive us nuts when we feel the feedback of that need for speed where top-down goals only expects numbers, like outcomes, and doesn't care for what goes on in the cockpit. Much of that sounds like the harsh bad old days where self-called masters expected from people, their time and energy, and saw them as effort-deploying units that happens to walk and talk, and to be tired. 

With that, if a modern doer feels the toxic smoke coming from that managerial engine and witness through the mirror as fixing it is not on her to-do list. Instead, and quite sadly, that affects her blood,  increases anxiety, and affects the joy of even driving it. Moreover, it has the power to impact her option - to not be so excited with - about the subject of managing progress with goals. Equaly sad is when some of us drivers are called to set the management framework - like when they become founders - and finally get to be in a position to hire and recruit others; and even if they don't do it in the most brutal old ways, they still can't figure much what to do except to set some breezy version of setting top-down expectation and expect outcomes in the hope that their subordinates can do it.

* Outline - Answer k1.0.3 -   Question-answer - Through OKR, we can reflect on the core aspects that brings anxiety and how achieving goal is challenging and needs a top-down vs bottom-up collaboration.

If we hold the position that a longer plan is valid, or meaningful, and required. This view recognizes that people get to do things because of their connection with what has to be done. This also aligns with the startup situation where there is a prior movement exists before getting things ready, before action, such as the precursor movement from inspiration, from having a viewpoint about something that needs to be changed. In other words, it may be overlooked that a strong objective exists - especially when organizations are already running driven by so clear stronger objectives. Now, with that in sight, we are also seeking a way for our management of progress to recognize and reconciliate the top-down goals with the realities of the doers, which in the view of OKR this recogniztion happens through bottoms-up analysis. 

Let us then briefly cover the historical perspective about goal-setting and management of goals and how the urgencies of its execution sets the very top-down goals that oftenly appears harshly upon us. With that, we will contrast with the other side, the bottoms-up reality of the doers which also requires the management of the self as we are trying to figure our contribution in a setting such as a team or a unit of work. With these two perspectives, we will introduce OKR although in alignment with our strategy which is less of a playbook and more intended to poke into the OKR conversation to see how it deals with these perspectives.

What appears from the historical perspective, the flight from above, is that the science of goal management is evolving; and that it had entered to face the hard reality that goal management has to stretch to enable doers to achieve their goals, especially that aspiring and ambitious goals are more frequent as opposed to the expected commitments where humans are expected to act as robots. The following passage from Stephen Covey, from *7 Habits of Highly Effective People*, we are moving from time management towards the managent of ourselves: 

> *"In the area of time management, each generation builds on the one before it - each one moves us toward greater control of our lives. The first wave or generation could be characterized by notes and checklists, an effort to give some semblance of recognition and inclusiveness to the many demands placed on our time and energy.
> The second generation could be characterized by calendars and appointment books. This wave reflects an attempt to look ahead, to schedule events and activities in the future.
> The third generation reflects the current time management field. It adds to those preceding generations the important idea of prioritization, of clarifying values and of comparing the relative worth of activities based on their relationship to those values. In addition, it focuses on setting goals – specific long-, intermediate-, and short-term targets toward which time and energy would be directed in harmony with values. It also includes the concept of daily planning, of making a specific plan to accomplish those goals and activities determined to be of greatest worth. 
> While the third generation has made a significant contribution, people have begun to realize that "efficient" scheduling and control of time are often counterproductive. The efficiency focus creates expectations that clash with the opportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs and to enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis."* 
> (Covey, Stephen., 1989, p.149-150)

He concludes, since we moved on from that *time management* to the management of ourselves, that we shifted from expecting tasks to be done - the *things* in *time* - and as the fourth generation we became interested in accomplish results and building relationships.

Thiis is where OKR can be more properly introduced in the context of that wider goal-setting and management of goals context. Before anything, and in alignment with this view from perspective, we should acknowledge that OKR was recently popularized by the championing work of John Doerr [^footnote_johndoerr_okr] , through the evangelism work where he pushed the movement further inside Google, and through the book entitled *Measure What Matters*, where the discussion continues to evolve. After the work, and through the WhatsMatters side [^foonote_whatmatters_site] and other resources such as the What Matters course [^footnote_whatmatters_course], one can see part of a wider movement which is occupied with testing, experimenting, learning, and evolving the conversation. 

[^footnote_johndoerr_okr]: John Doerr, a renowned venture capitalist, has been a vocal advocate for the framework of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) which he discusses in his book *Measure What Matters*. He learned much about this methodology directly from Andy Grove during his time at Intel. 

[^foonote_whatmatters_site]: 

[^footnote_whatmatters_course]: 

The popular OKR, objectives and key resources, is at this point recognized as a framework. According to John Doerr, we can see how it became used at Google from the beginning - and important to note is that it survived what could be seen as a chaotiocally smart space of the top-tier Silicon Valley companies that we oftenly be so proud of being chaotic. Of course, that chaotic space is a reflection and observation of spaces where the best ideas can put a dent in the universe of the status-quo. But John has put it in written form - it survived the Google test which maybe not the best test in the world - not the most creative company - but still is good enough to indicate that the framework, and the ideas behind are not nonsensical: 

> *""* John Doerr, Measure What Matters 

Beyond that, and according to John too, the experience at Google wasn't the start; as he revealed the origins being a work that Andy Grove - while he was the CEO of intel - was championing and properly written as management by objectives. John had the opportunity to learn directly from Andy what was at the time the evolution of another conversation which was pushed by Peter Drucker: 

> *""* Andy Grove, High Output Management 

From these observations, it is also inescapable the idea that OKR - or management by objectives - were developed in the high-growth space of companies that had a market, or market-fit, and had to execute and at the same time deal with new people being hired, people that needed to figure what they could do best and managers concerned with that, and with the corporate expectations that workers were there to improve themselves into their best conditions to support the company goals. 

With that said, the construction of OKR through the days of Andy Grove had to face the concerns that the doers were not mere servants, that they had their identities and their views; not purely from any inclination of humaninistic perspective (which would likely be expected from a mind like Andy Grove) but also because Intel happened to go through hard times where Andy noticed that the middle in-the-middle, real workers such as middle managers, were the ones in the position to save the company from trouble, such as of major trouble of a major ship that goes only in the direction of the top-down major objectives that if continuing the movement so blindly would simple and innevitably hit the catastrophic - like a titanic - outcome of sinking the whole ship. In other words, Andy were concerned with the strong winds, or strong forces, of the external market that could make a heavy and big ship even one going in a direction of certainty to sink. IN the book, Only the Paranoid Survive, Andy elaborates how Intel were moving in a direction and were quite sudden caught in the middle of the 10x force - when the competition from the the Japanese would likely sink Intel as the Japanese had a new technolgy much better -  and how they had to struggle to figure, or to be sensitive, to the data that happen to be felt by the people in the middle of the field - like the salespeople, middle managers:

#### How OKR sees top-down 

These ilustrations, of the hard days of these managers, are good for us to have a sense of the how OKR happened to be constructed. Can a company that is in high-growth, and strong, that needs to set goals and expectations to its workers, keep a system that enables them to not follow so blindly? In other words, OKR starts yes with the top-down goals and expectations, it wants it to be real and meangful - and it is okay with the driving goal of 2 years. But equaly balanced is the view that is bundle within - that without it one would read the following like a super strict and harsh reason to be disciplined with the goals as in written in stone; but not, the nuanced view there is more: 

> *"An effective goal setting system starts with disciplined thinking at the top, with leaders who invest the time and energy to choose what counts."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)

The point from John is a great openning for us to consider how the element of 'disciplined thinking' connects with the element and the role of the 'leader' and how that has less to do with the an actual superior entity, like a boss that passes on words to subordinates ordering them to follow, suh as like movements the brutal controllers that only happens to confuse us. The point from John brings about the responsible role that appears when you are to make change - that otherwise can't be done - to come about. This element is the necessary element of an entity - an individual, a team, an unit, and the whole organization. In 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey help us to see the top-down element that transcends any idea of hierarchies from organizations: 

> *"Effective management is putting things first. While leadership decides what 'first things' are, it is management that puts them first, day-by-day, moment-by-moment. Management is discipline, carrying it out. "* (Covey, Stephen., 1989, p.148) 

And digs even more: 

> *"Discipline derives from disciple - disciple to a philosophy, disciple to a set of principles, disciple to a set of valyes, disciple to an overriding purpose, to a superordinate goal or a person who represents that goal. "* (Covey, Stephen., 1989, p.148)

--> 

In other words, if we happen to see the chart when we think of top-down, we happen just to see the by-product of a prior success of someone that likely had conquered stability and that is performing, expecting, under their assumptions that they are on the right path. But if when we come to terms with the essence, the top-down comes really from the goal, the objective, the thing that you or anyone, team or unit, is onto.

Managers know that doers' real contribution rises from the doing - from the action - and it is influenced by how they do and why they do and therefore their state of well-being which supports their creative state. Or they get to know that over time as it is inescapable. Therefore, the perspective of the doers enters management, even if by fragments of what happens from the office of their psychologists, because it enters the workplace and because it impacts the organization's productivity. Peter Drucker, in Managing Oneself, portraits frames of the big movie and how the what is told is provoked with the what's happening:

> *"Throughout history, the great majority of people never had to ask the question, What should I contribute? They were told what to contribute, and their tasks were dictated either by the work itself - as it was for the peasant or artisan - or by a master or a mistress - as it was for domestic servants. And until very recently, it was taken for granted that most people were subordinates who did as they were told. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, the new knowledge workers (the so-called organization men) looked to their company's personnel department to plan their careers. 
> Then, in the late 1960s, no one wanted to be told what to do any longer. Young men and women began to ask, What do I want to do? And what they heard was that the way to contribute was "to do your own thing." But this solution was as wrong as the organization men's had been. Very few of the people who believed that doing one's own thing would lead to contribution, self-fulfillment, and success achieved any of the three."* (Drucker, Peter. 2008. pp. 35)

And goes on into a more enlightened view that the management of the self gains space, and consciousness, as the work place evolves. The modern doer is there, more aware of their development. They are alive and they react more. The following three elements of from the anyone working in an organization isn't a duty given by a manager but a way for the actual contributor to look at what they do there: 

> *"What should my contribution be? To answer it, it must address three distinct elements. What does the situation require? Given my strenghts, my way of performing, and my values. How can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference."* (Drucker, Peter. 2008. pp. 35)

Now, if that role of the doer is alive and if OKR something to say about that is it so as a consequence of the very real frame of work that brought OKR. From the perspective of evangelism, John Doerr popularized it at Google and through the *Measure What Matters* but of course by checking its own usage and from its past experience by Andy Grove as he worked at Intel and learned about management by objectives directly from Andy. In addition, Andy has credited that he improved his views of management by objectives from Peter Drucker.

> *""* Andy Grove (Andy on Peter, from High Output Management)

All that to give us a view that OKR has strong points because of the interest if we want to make it real and strong and meaningful and if we are interested in improving it from the actual experience of doing it; and recognizing the changes that happens. Therefore, it is not unwise to consider that the willingness for one to contribute, in an organization, has ties with the effort to manage oneself. It's everywhere how OKR carries the viewpoint of the doer: 

> *"Leaders must get across the *why* as much as the *what*. Their people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)

Now if people to join projects, with causes and goals, they do because they know their strenghts can be used for the situation that needs to be changed. And, as they feel that they can do something. Likewise, the structure of a goal-setting project, such as one having a clarity for the expected results that favors the goal, is likely respected by the doers and needed by the organization viewpoint. In other words, the clarity - that OKR requires - for what has to be done and how the doers connect is just a needed minimum requirement for anyone to be involved. It is what makes them to show up not feeling completely lost.

--> 

#### Appears to be a fight 

Before we move into the next section - the aspects of course-correction - it is worth to go back to an illustration of a fight and into an extrapolation of the inherent fight that has less to do with the boss versus the subordinate fight. The top-down appears to provoke a fight, indeed, with the bottom-up role. As in on one side there is the one that tells and on the other side the one that does, the doer that suffers in many situations, such as anxiety or producing their tears as a by-product. But if these roles show a fight, and the human nature seem to be exposed in its worse if you go back in history taking photos capturing the fight of them; the more we evolve we seem to find a sort of inner fight, or challenge, that really gets this view of being fire and fight more because of the not humanized paths we came from, which confuses us. In other words, the essense may seem like a fight but it is really a learning process nad management process that is required for anything new to be brought and change the system. 

Or if we look for the fight that happens in the micro context, a small team even of friends working, a fight that also happens within the micro context of the individual. This is the fight that one deals with when they want to lose weight, or to learn to write, or to come up with an invention when the materials to do so are not fully in place, or seeking a freedom in a space where the rules yet don't allow. Achieving them goals will be hard, like it or not, we will only have to face the reality that we as managers have to nurture the environment for them to be achieved because the doer can only do one thing - to contribute - if they are onto it. That is yet another reason for the goals to be meaningful for them. And if we are wearig this hat, or when we are wearing this hat, we are into the need to comply with the understanding of what should our contribution be. This relationship between our personalities - one being the innocent doer or the sensitive doer that is learners; and the other being the critic or the editor that will demand results, is natural. Our goal, as managers and minimally at this point that we are really reflecting with all of this, is to continue to check what the conversaion - like the OKR one - is telling us for how we can do our best especailly that we may not know what to do and what generally the goal is not yet clear as well. 

#### Course-correcting or discovery of indicators?

BUt likewise with the concerns, these are there in ways that the doer is real, a contributor, and not following blindly. The opportunity is for understanding the best work possible and also reading from the data, the real information that is applicable to the context. In the view of Andy the meetings with the managers are the key aspect where the doer is the owner and the manager is there to help:

Now, from the more peaceful space between the role of the one that wants the top-down, against the role of the one that tries to be a contribor, the health dynamics is not only the only thing to do, and necessary but also when explored will be the space for the actual opportunity - and we will come to  recognize that in most of the situations we do not have clarity about how we phrased our top-down goals too - and that the actual work of doing it is the work that gives light to the path. Let's move on to see how that opportunity to course-correct goals happens and how OKR supports that too.

## OKR on course-correction

<!-- 
@meta @value
* 3 stars - anxiety 
* 3 stars - blocked and locked 
--> 

When it comes to translating objectives into actions, taken that we start from the wishes, the target, the top top, a top-down modelling effort is put in place - indeed based on a big goal, whiten down as an objective. The modelling phase is part of the planning process intended to find things that we can do that can bring that objective closer. 

The other component of it has to do with the Key Results which is how the team moves to pull the goal closer. There is no doubt that OKR aims for achieving the objectives. In other words, the objective that is writen down is not to change. And that creates the condition for the performer to focus and work in the key results. 


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.2 - intro - complication - 
--> 

The natural question, or complication with that idea, is exactly that it pulls the team towards being locked by the requirements of the goals and key results, which indeed could cause anxiety when the performer feels that things are not going well. Worse it is when, in the face of the feeling that things are not going well, the performer is pressured to work even more towards pre-defined key results, as if assuming that more effort would save the strategy. And, of course, when the matter involves the outcome not serving well, more anxiety certainly comes our way. 

But then, with that idea, it is time to consider if OKR passes the complication pointed by David and Jason, who stated: 

> *"the sooner you admit you have no idea what the world will look like in five years, three years, or even one year, the sooner you will be able to move forward without the fear of making the wrong big decision years in advance."* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33).

Indeed, when working with innovative products, in a world that changes fast, that sounds about the situation that many founders live. It might come a situation of conflict when the findings pull the team to reconsider but in fact they feel that they cannot change direction, cannot be creative, or even when the team looses interest because things are too mechanical in the face of, as indicated, corporate anxiety. The situation becomes confusion as the required goal can create confusion in the face of other elements that are essential for the ones actually working, such as the things that comes after the question that Peter Drucker brought up: how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.2 - intro - question - 
--> 

Therefore, it is justifiable to question if OKR has mechanisms in place that supports teams to evaluate and course-correct what they do, as they go. In this direction, it is important to note that as much as OKR exists to help with pulling the objectives closer, OKR is also promoted as a framework that supports evaluation, which is primarily driven by the evaluation of the key results, as key results are executed, which consequently creates an opportunity for objectives to be evaluated, first against key results, but also in the face of the existing strategy or higher objectives. 


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.2 - intro - answer - 
--> 

Does OKR supports the possibility that objectives and the key results are not well designed - we working in a bad direction? Not only so, but it's necessary mechanism to support the growth, transcending, learning, moving on. 

With that problem ahead of us, let us continue to investigate if OKR has course-correction that supports learning and evalution of the goals. The short answer is yes, although we have to acknowlege how difficult it is to use a goal-setting system that seems to offer an escape hatch for escaping the ship such as change the plan on the go. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.1 - Collaboration aspect of OKR - transparency of key results 
--> 

Consider an OKR that started with an initial objective, such as an objective that was created ahead of any work, such as one that comes from a mission or a vision. It does so with the purpose of pushing the design process of OKR into the modelling, or planning, for the steps that are thought to be steps that pulls the objective closer. 

This part, the Key Results part of OKR, appears first as a mechanism to keep track, that adds transparency, and which reveals what is being done and what is ahead. In additin, it is also a mechanism that offers a window of opportunity to see what goes on and how what is being done connects with where we want to go. Here is where OKR starts to get complicated as, in essence, it's becomes a collaboration mechanism. What I mean by complicated is that much more simpler to simply use OKR for tracking, as in a stream that goes to one direction, than for enabling it as a collaborative communication tool that allows teams to evaluate what they do, to change what they are tracking, if not to chage what they are going after. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.1.1 - Collaboration aspect of OKR  - and case of a book writing 
--> 

Through a case of writing we can see how the mechanis of using key results can be powerful, and where we establish the minimal effort with a maximum impact, through honoring the collaborative process that take place, transparently, honestly. The upfront "daring" accomodation of key results with the open mindset to evaluate is the key. 

First looking at the simpler dimention of OKR, consider when one said that she is to write a book. She expects to deliver pages, or chapters, or to do a number of interviews, to come up with the articles, and to engage in several processes that would bring the objective closer. OKR asks her to pick a few key results that she believes will help. Although OKR doesn't go into strategy, what to pick, it proposes a system where the discussion happens, even for one working alone. If you write it down, and if you set your objectives, and if you set your key results, then you are writing it for the sake of letting collaboration to take place; so that you know, so that you can read, so that you can reflect. Therefore, it is less for the sake of presenting or keeping the score, or for serving as a personal grading for what was performed. It is, instead, for the sake of openning a window, a way to see, a way to talk, a discussin to happen, about the said, or written, key results; as as well the objective since it is all interconnected. With the communication going on, she can run the evaluation cycle and change her OKR for the next cycle. 

This collaborative aspect of OKR, used by organizations that reportedly does well, consider that some of them require individuals to post their OKRs, to share. This situation takes a great culture and great effort in the first place. They report benefits such as when an employee, by knowing what other employee is doing, can offer help indirectly such as to give hints, advices, and new ideas. Moreover, the essence of this is that the doer is okay in the doing of it, even in the early stages, even when mistakes are apparent. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.1.2 - Course correct - internal market starts with honesty and transparency
--> 

> ".................." 

When exposing what we do, the things we are doing, and letting others chime in to help, even people that are not connected directly, it is natural to consider that the mechanism promotes communication and open ideas to flow in which would result in an opportunity to reduce self bias and improve not only effectiveness, in the sense of performance for what is being done and in the sense of the simpler nature of accounting and tracking, but also taken that this simpler factor is present, the more complex collaborative communication which is the opportunity to evaluate all that is being done. 

Consider that the point about transparency and collaboration has to do not with the benefits like gambling, of one helping with the other, as if people have the clicks, that is a by-product of doing in a collaborative and transparency way. But in addition to that, it is important to recognize that transparency, having things written down, also reveals failure in the eyes of everyone, which could be complicated depending on the effects from the exposure of failure, such as if the protagonists of the failed propositions aren't to be valued. Therefore, in other words, the exposure goes along with the necessity of the right attitude, a system of protection which when exists gains a strategic meaning, as indicated by Michael Dearing, gains a tone of competition, a healthy competition: 

> *"It seems to me that the best product roadmaps come from vigorous internal competition for time and talent from engineering, design, marketing. " Michael Dearing (2016)

The point suggested by Micheal was isnpired from the general point about competition in macro markets (2016) - the situation and acknowledgement that competition drives better results with the rise of the winning competitor. But then, deriving from that, it comes the natural question if any of that is the actual mechanism we use when we come up with a better thing to do in the face of our goals. Perhaps Michael saw the whole world as a one big company which is the analogy for the intercal micro market and the notion of competition. In this model, consider that there is the input of doing, from doing, from vision, from brainstorming, first in the beginning of a process like a funnel. And then, a quantitative and qualitative judgement chimes in which separates the gold from the things that we can separate, as in the data to support recyling it. 

But a quite important aspect of it has to do with the need for transparency and exposure. "Put the roadmap where everyone can see it is one of the most powerful actions a founder can take." (2016) which goes along with " It is to be expected that people who care about what they work on are disappointed when something doesn’t work out the way they wanted. The approach above arms them with the information they need to make sense of the disappointment and to improve the probability that their next ideas will get funded." (2016)

Notice that in the illustration he created the idea of "funded" can be interpreted as approved or the general idea of buy-in.

@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.2. - Course correct - Allowing the editor-critic 
--> 

It is valid to assert that OKR, as a framework, promotes the effort of colloration that involves, checking, evaluating, and changing direction. Consider, for example, another aspect of OKR where Key Results - as promoted by the viewpoint of John Doerr - can be defined as aspirational or commitment based. These approaches exist to accommodate the situations where a lot of learning, such as discovery, is involved - commitment based key results offers an approach to check progress for the moments that we know exactly what needs to be done. Again, the applicability and value from it depends on the strategic planning. 

But the evaluation of the what happens, according to the approach, is key and should be likely done at all times. Not only after the fact that when done properly communication and contributions happens indirectly as indicated. The natural execution of it requires constant evaluation that involves self review and peer review, such as a review with a manager. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.2. - Course correct - Allowing the editor-critic - complication - 
--> 

Of course, depending on the culture, toxic aspects can come the way to influence the process to offer no value. For example, depending on how the measurement of performance of an employee is done, such as when the compensation is associated with the Key Results and moving towards the Objective as written, then the results can be catrastrofic. Would one want to course correct its path, after having good reasons for so, after knowing that she or he could be evaluated as bad performer and even get fired? That kind of situation would certainly bring anxiety and a lot of distractions for a call that would not likely happen. 

It is important to pause here and reflect that a lot of companies indeed enters that mode. They set goals in stone, they put prizes for the ones that follows the path as written, they punish the ones that didn't do well. Then it comes the question, do they course correct? Yes but they do that in macro terms, by facing a crisis, which likely involve getting people fired, managers fired, teams reorganized. From the point of view of an employee, under a whole team that got fired for moving in the bad direction claiming it was good, the employee generally tries to escape the spiral of death by reclaiming that he was told to do that job and was performing well. In a lot of situations like that, a lot of people can get away. But still, anxiety was present and a lot of effort to manage the crisis which can and should be considered a bad use of the time of people. 

Therefore, it is ideal to think that a plan for progressing is not about a plan for evaluating people - as in to consider them in or out the boat. This is a key aspect of the OKR approach that when well considered can make OKR become a useful tool and one that also serves well for course-correcting and actually bringing everyone on board and focusing on what matters. 

With a cadence for evaluating what is being done, with allowance for reviewing with transparency and strategic thinking too, the approach can help person to change the plan at the level of the Key Results and also Objectives.

The effort of redoing the OKR hundreds of times, is for the sake of being open. Now, in this regard, a question that comes is if OKR does not allow room for bottom-up contributions that affects the top-down. Part of it I have covered, the conversation is there. But the cycle for reviewing all the top down plan exists too and bottom-up contributions is recognized as key. In other words, the approach needs and depends on the confrontation of the what we want to do with the what is happening. Of course, the cadence for that sort of strategic planning work might have a cadence, needs a cadence applicable to the organization.

## The battle of Outcome vs. Output  

There are situations that people enter the OKR train is valid, as it stops beautifully on time in the station. It’s a trip with a goal, such as to learn and use OKR in the best way possible. But then we enter in it, the wagon starts smooth and the scenery is beautiful, it’s unbelievable and the roadmap seem to make sense with scenes around. But then, give it some time and housing passing by. Suddenly the lights of the train blinks arbitrarily and we hear something craking as the speed of the train increases fast. A yellow light fades under the seat and people start to be worried. Next stop, unknown, the train enters a tunel, the heater stops working, and it goes on for another 2 hours with the speed increasing. What is next will blow your mind. You can't go back to revisit the trip. You are on it and it is going of the tracks. This is where you start to lose faith in your OKR trip and your training. 

The way that Christina Wodtke puts it in her article - entitled *"Are You Sure You Want to Use OKRs?"* I love it because the actual *Call to Action* calls for a reflection: 

> *"There is a concept I call drift. Drift means that a process has drifted away from the original framing. It happened to Agile. What started as a simple idea that people should work collaboratively and iteratively became people policing each other on the True Agile Way: “this is how to write a user story” and “Stand up can’t be more than 15 minutes long.”"* (Wodtke, 2022)

The complication that I had was that I have identified that OKR learning starts smooth but hits a wall at some point. Not sure if you have seen this but a lot of the OKR articles - and there is a lot of them now trying to help with problems, ambiguities, struggles - sort of gets a bit complicated at a specific point. Things get hard when the learner moves toward the shape/design/model of Key Results. The core of this learning complication, in my opinion, has its epicenter in the Output vs. Outcome discussion.

[1] When John Doerr (and team) launched Measure What Matters, I believe the fight was not there. However, with time, they published their positioning - What Matters: Output vs. outcome with OKRs. https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/outputs-vs-outcome-okr

[2] On the other hand, many product managers (which seems to be the case) are moving their troops using Outcome-oriented thinking. Christina Vodjke, the author of Radical Focus and Stanford Professor, has indicated that Outcome-oriented is better - https://cwodtke.medium.com/you-cant-handle-okrs-5465cf161e81

So I was stuck in my small world, preferring a bit towards Output/action, which gives me a way to judge/evaluate actual action strategy. But yet stuck anyway or unhappy with the complexity in the center of this fight, as I have figured. No articles seemed to address the Outcome vs. Output question in the context of management.



<!--
@meta @outline

* Change this - For OKR, my conclusion would be that the needle, to adjust towards output-based or outcome-based, would depend on what is delivered. For example, if the project in the hands of an individual is very design-oriented where the executor is learning/discovering/stepping into the unknown (old or young), they might consider it output-based. If the project has found direction, then an outcome-based can be handy.

To be fair with Christina, notice that the context may matter. In the above view, she had assummed what she referred as "prep work" which I would then relaltively agree with the idea of key results to have that inclination to outcomes, if you have indeed a crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency: 

> *"Do the prework. Make sure you have a crisp strategy. Make sure your teams have psychological safety. Make sure your product teams are multidisciplinary (Product, Design and Engineering.) Fire bad managers. Adopt Agile and Lean practices. Create as many self-sufficient teams as possible. Value effectiveness over efficiency."* (Wodtke, 2022)

So up to here, I had identified the complication in the learning journey of a founder.Moving towards the potential answer, the following author gave us a cartoon to help us understand Output vs. Outcome, although he promotes Outcome-based for OKR:+ Cartoon is [Resouces -> Activites -> Output -> Outcome -> Impact]https://medium.com/@jseiden/to-write-better-okrs-use-outcomes-e82be6e7b460

The likely core of the worriness of Christina has to do with the struggle if you are interested in being open about the actual efforts you make.

#### Recovering the reflective opportunity - The window 

Adjusting Christina's approach to make it work with the output-based, would be about acknowledging first the good intentions in the good not the best: 

>*"The best is the enemy of the good. If you are spending weeks refining the language of the objective and pinning down just the right metrics, your company is in the business of process management. That’s wasteful. Try to make good OKRs but remember there is a time when you have to say, good enough for now. You don’t want to spend three weeks setting your goals and lose the time you could be working toward them instead." (Wodtke, 2022)

But moving forward, the output-based version that is friendly with that can be about the "refining the language of the objective" after the fact that the output is being generated. Or more precisely, the key results being executed, such as action and effort, generates the data, the information, and opportunity. It is the judgement of the effort, a clearly stated effort, that allows the team to do it again, to adjust things. In other words, the adjustment to the key results is the actual opportunity, as we can see, as we can talk about, what is going on. THis is circles back to the points about collaboration from the prior section. 

The idea of using Key Results to quantity success can be dangerous because your objective should be your success. The key results, in the appraoch that is honest and collaborative shall then become the key elements that gives us the opportunity to re-evaluate. The danger of moving straight under the assumption of quantification of success using Key Results [^footnote_christinawodtke_key_results_quantity_success] is that you can miss keep traking of what you are doing, missing the window of opportunity for evaluation, and in the case of weak cultures, this may also become doing things outside the window of what is visible and accountable which is where a lot of people are able to get things done - but there is a price to pay. The price to pay is the inneviable disatisfaction with OKR in general, running with arbitrary investments, the discussions of the real effort and activities happening somewhere else - for example.

The viewpoint given by Reforge is also mature to recognize not only the different kinds of key results but strategic mixing of these kinds to actually improve the deepthness of connection with the purpose, the objectives: 

> *"They come together to paint a picture of what needs to happen for your objective to be successful. .. There are output-metric key results — such as delivering an important feature — as well as outcome-oriented key results. It’s also important to note that outcome-oriented key results can come in two varieties based on the metric within the key result."*

#### Clarity for effort vs. outcome using roles of junior vs. senior 

That shows a complex approach that some of the Mozilla managers had for measuring folks, where "junior people can be measured by effort" while "the outcome can measure senior people."The framing of this last article helped me see correlations with:+ junior/senior+ unknown/known+ divergence/convergence+ aspirational/commitment+ effort/outcomeAnd that helped me to see better that the adjustment of the needle (from action, to output, to outcome) could be done depending on the context of the objective.Therefore, if you don't know much about what you are doing, you can measure by effort and revisit faster (100 times). If you are confident, the measure could be oriented towards an outcome.That could also explain why composed OKR (team level) could be more oriented to outcomes and why an individual could be more oriented to effort. Not sure.

[4] Until today. When I was following the articles in order, you had your "/5" article referring to the "/29" article (Leadership is not about your good intentions / https://mfbt.ca/leadership-is-not-about-your-good-intentions-5e21666cb01b ) which has provoked my mind as I reached the following diagram:

* "Junior people we evaluate on effort."
* "Senior people we evaluate on outcomes."

The above blew my mind, my friends. A neuron in a galaxy far away was able to say hi to another neuron in another faraway galaxy.

But it wasn't only that, you kept, in this article, provoking my mind with things such as "who is junior" or "what means junior" or "why?"

Having had a light, I am here pondering one thing as I try to go back to Output vs. Outcome in the context of OKR. Besides the excellent spectrum provided by [3] Seid, this potential addition has to do with the visualization that effort might go along with design/divergent thinking on the one hand. In contrast, the outcome might go along with design/convergent.

As in - open vs. clone

As in - discover vs. execute

As in - aspirational vs. commitment

I do not know if my awakening has a significant flaw, but something seems linear here or structured about the problem.

##### Who is the junior? 

What matters, really, is that you can be just out of the sudden under a need to flip yourself, to embraced a personality, to model it, to consider the maturity level for that task. In other words, no matter how senior you are, you can be a junior at any time depending on your objectives ahead: 

> *"Holding a junior employee accountable for the success of the organization isn’t realistic. Without those strategies, they don’t know how to make success happen. So we substitute in productivity goals, progress goals. Are you writing clean code? Are you collaborating well?"* (Nightingale, 2017)

##### Rupture and maturity dissonance 

An outcome of setting a mature expectation to your now-junior doer is that you create a maturity dissonance which under the need to keep all strict as "this is the way" you bring about rupture to your working team - and moreover misses the point which is using the effort phase to bring about and to discover maturity: 

> *" When you’re new it’s hard to know the difference between a bad idea, a good idea with the wrong team, and a good team with a bad plan. It encourages people to be hair trigger and awful to each other as a way to seem smart. It encourages other people to leave."* (Nightingale, 2017)

--> 

##### Maturation models 

The model which we aim, which especially is the case for startups, is that the roles are dynamic. The "mature" corporate situation has the light for the solution. If you are mature enough to do that, it is then that you are positioning and understand that there is a way to actually push the outcome you want:

> *"Every company needs a set of folks who do understand the context. Who can be held accountable for the right things actually getting done. That’s what executives are for. You are the people who turn strategy into execution. It’s a hard job. It’s why you get a fancy title and a high salary and a team of people. You need to prioritize, spot problems early, adapt and adjust. You need to empower your teams to be creative, but never step so far away that you lose the thread of how they’ll get it done. "* (Nightingale, 2017)

This again aligns with the given "prep work" suggested by Christina, in my rewriting, the  "crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency." (Wodtke, 2022) 

#### If OKR is the roadmap then it's not evaluation of performance 

The idea of not being so hard is exactly about allowing the doer to fail with the key results and reevaluate which key results bring the doer "back into" the promising direction. Now for thre sake of solving the complex question - should I go with outcome or output - and given the point given, we may use, for the sake of the reflection, the advice from the professor of the MWM Course: 

> *"Contribution is not the same as “making your OKRs.” Did this person make smart choices and stay focused on moving the numbers? Did they gain traction? Did they learn what not to do? And not everyone can contribute to OKRs, so you will need something more than “making OKRs” to evaluate them on.*" (Wodtke, 2022)
