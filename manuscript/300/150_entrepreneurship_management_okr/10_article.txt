If entrepreneurial effort happens to creatively destroy the old and change anything, it does so by getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone] and less with theoretical or fictional ideas. Execution is, therefore, a necessity for change; even though creativeness is fundamental part for getting things done in the way that you can innovate in the market. As we do, and as much as we do not follow a very scientific approach, we are inclined to measure our progress, based on what we want to do, what we are doing, and how we are doing. With that, comes a complication: How to track our progress effectively when what we are doing requires innovation and walking through the path of uncertainty? How to do it in a way that the creative and aspirational component simultaneously supports the concretes? 

[^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter, in Capitalism, socialism, and democracy, highlights the characterization of "getting things done" (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132) as an essencial element of the entrepreneurial function - even more than other elements such as entrepeneurial ability to invent new things or create the conditions for the entreprise to thrive - which becomems so necessary for creative destruction to happen.

To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions with the enterprise exploit.

It's unescapable - the more success we have the more we will be happy to know how we are progressing, the more we will want to move not in arbitrary ways and love to know that communication about our objectives, and how to get there [^foonote_michaeldearing_clearobjectives], influences not only our outcomes but also our happiness. And even if the path is uncertain, to have a clear plan even when the plan is - I have to learn. But it may not be clear the impact of goal tracking and goal progressing in the beginning when one is not proficient in the art and science of management by objectives. 

Goal setting in general exists. And in the startup situation there are popularized frameworks and methods for goal-setting and progressing. A popular one is OKR, Objectives and Key Results, which is essentially a framework or approach of management by objectives.

As much as we have solutions to help track execution, is it not easy to have a clear view of what goes on and to see in perspective, such as to see when and how to change, or even to re-evaluate objectives. We keep falling in traps also for the matter of managing productivity, even to a point of doubting the ways to manage progress.  

In *It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work* by Fried and Hansson (2018, p. 32), the authors provoke readers with the article "Making it up as you go." They argue that adhering strictly to strong goals, such as setting 2, 3, or even 5-year plans, can be detrimental to genuine progress.

Althought they don't endorse the big and sticky goal plan, a slow refletion is a must. With "Make it up as you go" they are concerned that teams can sometimes put goals that works the other way around - that costs more time. But worse than that, it changes how teams perform as anxiety comes their way:

> *"Much corporate anxiety comes from the realization that the company has been doing the wrong thing, but it is too late to change the direction because of the 'Plan.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33)

In other words, they recognize that unexpected outcomes shows as teams advance towards something, like a goal, as they come across data that challenges what they were doing. Therefore, if following David and Jason viewpoint, we have to face the importance of creating the conditions for a healthy way of working. No anxiety on our way is key when it comes to understanding the discoveries that can likely help us to improve our roadmap, including the possibility of let go for a bad goal.

It seems reasonable to lock in a "Therefore" here. That we all seek to instill a healthy condition for the worker to evaluate what they are doing. Their call has more to do with that, as opposed to not having a plan at all.

But a pattern of planning is shown by them and put us in a good position to check, or ask, if a stronger goals, such as long-term goals, make sense and how to deal with that in the face of uncertainty: 

> *"Every six weeks or so, we decide what we will be working on next. And that is the only plan we have. Anything further out is considered a 'maybe, we will see.'"* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 32).

In as move further, we will keep the concern of the Basecamp founders alive - like watching out - but we will guide our discussion using OKR - because being perfect or imperfect OKR is acctually widely used and accepted and through that there are many important discussions, conversations. 

Their "maybe, we will see" is an invitation for us to continue a reflective moment about goals such as long-term goals. If something is "maybe", it implies that something is exposed, or being discussed, or shared in the first place. And the "we will see" sets a principle which says something like "we will learn and decide." Therefore, there is a discussion going on. With that invitation, let's look at what others have documented, such as from theorists, practitioners, and entrepreneurs that claim that goals, and even long-term goals, matter. 

Let us move further, first to test or check OKR in terms of its top-down, why it asks for ambitious goals,  and makes sense to start from there, and how OKR discussions deals with the likelyhood of lack of flexibility.

* Outline - Answer k1.1 - How top-down matters? 
--> 

Let us consider if the notion of the longer plan can apply and what should be the degree of flexibility in which may align with the notions given by the Basecamp founders. If we hold the position that a longer plan is valid and meaningful, it may be so because goals are important. This view recognizes that people get to do things because of their connection with what has to be done. This also aligns with the startup situation where there is a prior movement exists before getting things ready, before action, such as the precursor movement from inspiration, from having a viewpoint about something that needs to be changed. In other words, it may be overlooked that a strong objective exists. 

Now, if we consider OKR - a method and framework (check) for getting things done, the concern of Basecamp founders might be a guiding opportunity to actualy understand the nuances of it, which would even perhaps give us the opportunity for a nuanced interpretation about if top-down goals matters and how to deal with the necessity of change along the way.

And if this is not yet of a reason for having the objective written down, we should also do so because the challenge for startups also involve changing the objective. The opportunities are in fact discovered through the learning and through the progress.

One of the resources to this reflection comes from a key book that has championed the idea of aligning and engaging teams around measurable goals. In the book entitled *Measure What Matters*, John Doerr [^footnote_johndoerr_okr] continued his saga to popularize a framework - known as OKR - that has helped him and his teams to innovate with goals.

[^footnote_johndoerr_okr]: John Doerr, a renowned venture capitalist, has been a vocal advocate for the framework of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) which he discusses in his book *Measure What Matters*. He learned much about this methodology directly from Andy Grove during his time at Intel. 

OKR, which stands for objectives and key resources, is a framework that provoke us to question if goals are strict or not and if it should be defined as long-term goals. As we hear, as we listen, as we read the details, these things that sometimes sound different might show a lot of similarities and good intentions. Therefore, and to be clear on our way of inquiry and our reflective moment, consider that we will seek less the "or" and will stick with the "and" for all the good things they have to give us. 

Let's consider Objectives and Key Results, from a general perspective. Does it require a main goal to exist? One such as a driving goal of 2 years? Yes, it is a way to go. It can and, according to the practitioners promoting it, it should. In terms having a defined goal ahead, John Doerr wrote it straight: 

> *"An effective goal setting system starts with disciplined thinking at the top, with leaders who invest the time and energy to choose what counts."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)

But a quick reading of that likely suggest an idea of a sort of visionary and disciplined being that knows. While when digging for the nuances, the leadership effort of goal-setting which they talk about has more to do with an initial effort of modelling goals with clarity: 

> *"Leaders must get across the *why* as much as the *what*. Their people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission."* (Doerr, J., 2018, p. 50)

And it makes sense, doesn't it? For a solo founder, a team just starting, and for the big ones. Consider, for example, the life of one that feels motivated enough to do something, to put their hands, to work. It is natural that people enter to work in projects as they have goals, such as goals that are bold, such as goals that asks for people to work towards them. It also makes sense that people join goals to be part of something, such as for the cause of aiming for a different world when things come true.

--> 

Thereore, we can't deny that the subject of goals connects with motivation and meaning. In other words, the reason that goals matters have also to do with our roles in it. We should note that people join causes to work on them for a while and the meaning might also break down in terms of expectations for what can be done (what we are doing) and how things can be done (how are doing). People evaluate themselves against their goals. 

Therefore, it is not unwise to consider that, for teams and as teams unfold, the existence of a goals create a condition for them not only to join, due to motivations and interest in the outcome, but to engage in a movement where they seek to identify how they can contribute. In the "What Should I Contribute?" section of Managing Oneself, Peter Drucker (2008) recognized an extreme situation of when one is being told what to do, one one hand which certainly is not appropriate in modern management, and, on the other hand, the response inclination of "do your own thing." However, he concludes that the inclination to doing one's own thing doesn't suffice when striving to contribute, achieve self-fulfillment, and find success (pp. 53-54).

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* reference - Drucker, P. (2008). Managing Oneself. Harvard Business School Press. pp. 53-54. 
--> 

We should account here that John Doerr is known as the evangelist of OKR as a framework, a work he started at Google. As he has recognized in *Measure What Matters*, the framework was given to him by Andy Grove while he worked at Intel. In addition, Andy has credited that he improved his Objectives and Key Results with learnings from Peter Drucker. Therefore, it is not unwise to consider that the willingness for one to contribute, in an organization, has ties with the effort to manage oneself. Peter has elaborated a contribution for the individual version of it: 

> *"What should my contribution be? To answer it, it must address three distinct elements. What does the situation require? Given my strenghts, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference."* (Drucker, Peter. 2008. pp. 35)

Thus it is uncommon for people to join projects, with causes and goals, as they know that their strenghts can be used for the situation that needs to be changed. And, as they feel that they can do something. Likewise, the structure of a goal-setting project, such as one having a clear documentation and expected results to favor the goal, is likely used by founders as they have to communicate round and improve their chances towards success.

Therefore, it is not unwise to notice how we gravitate towards having a plan, an outcome ahead, and even a 2-year plan, as a key element that may put us in a position to solve what is needed to be solved. Plus there seesm to exist an alignment with the too many stories, as told, that we have seen, and read, and watched, and continue to witness; the too many examples of people that told that they were doing something as in to change the world and they did. Plus, if one feels that goal-setting in the corporate is more like a storytelling that fails, with lots of traps (and it does have), and as they dig, they will find an entire field of research related to goal-setting. But if we dig, it is undeniable that out of goal-setting, and after goal-setting, we can find that the reason for the whole field has to do with how we react, how we fix ourselves, as we go. We can't deny that the environment created by a goal-setting system has the good intention to shape us towards progress, even when progress is yet to be discovered in the innovation space. 

There is the minimal unit of work for a goal which means "working for a goal" and can and should be honored. This is about showing up. Of course, no one wants to show up in ways that we burn resources but the very showing up and considering the best way possible, should then set us to discover the how should I contribute that is better, which is a good opening to the next section. This openning, that avoids the arbitrary movement, starts with having more time such as time to reflect. If you use your scarce resources, if you split time, you are making things harder in a way. And if you use wisely this time crack which takes the time you are doing - such as in arbitrary ways - you are then reflecting. And if you are doing so and considering how to do better, then you are acknowleding the possible better use of time. Thus goals vs. how should I contribute is a good start, a frame of reference, such as to set us in the direction of the next section.

## OKR analysis for Course-correction, failure, and opportunity 

<!-- 
@meta @value
* 3 stars - anxiety 
* 3 stars - blocked and locked 
--> 

When it comes to translating objectives into actions, taken that we start from the wishes, the target, the top top, a top-down modelling effort is put in place - indeed based on a big goal, whiten down as an objective. The modelling phase is part of the planning process intended to find things that we can do that can bring that objective closer. 

The other component of it has to do with the Key Results which is how the team moves to pull the goal closer. There is no doubt that OKR aims for achieving the objectives. In other words, the objective that is writen down is not to change. And that creates the condition for the performer to focus and work in the key results. 


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.2 - intro - complication - 
--> 

The natural question, or complication with that idea, is exactly that it pulls the team towards being locked by the requirements of the goals and key results, which indeed could cause anxiety when the performer feels that things are not going well. Worse it is when, in the face of the feeling that things are not going well, the performer is pressured to work even more towards pre-defined key results, as if assuming that more effort would save the strategy. And, of course, when the matter involves the outcome not serving well, more anxiety certainly comes our way. 

But then, with that idea, it is time to consider if OKR passes the complication pointed by David and Jason, who stated: 

> *"the sooner you admit you have no idea what the world will look like in five years, three years, or even one year, the sooner you will be able to move forward without the fear of making the wrong big decision years in advance."* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33).

Indeed, when working with innovative products, in a world that changes fast, that sounds about the situation that many founders live. It might come a situation of conflict when the findings pull the team to reconsider but in fact they feel that they cannot change direction, cannot be creative, or even when the team looses interest because things are too mechanical in the face of, as indicated, corporate anxiety. The situation becomes confusion as the required goal can create confusion in the face of other elements that are essential for the ones actually working, such as the things that comes after the question that Peter Drucker brought up: how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.2 - intro - question - 
--> 

Therefore, it is justifiable to question if OKR has mechanisms in place that supports teams to evaluate and course-correct what they do, as they go. In this direction, it is important to note that as much as OKR exists to help with pulling the objectives closer, OKR is also promoted as a framework that supports evaluation, which is primarily driven by the evaluation of the key results, as key results are executed, which consequently creates an opportunity for objectives to be evaluated, first against key results, but also in the face of the existing strategy or higher objectives. 


<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.0.2 - intro - answer - 
--> 

Does OKR supports the possibility that objectives and the key results are not well designed - we working in a bad direction? Not only so, but it's necessary mechanism to support the growth, transcending, learning, moving on. 

With that problem ahead of us, let us continue to investigate if OKR has course-correction that supports learning and evalution of the goals. The short answer is yes, although we have to acknowlege how difficult it is to use a goal-setting system that seems to offer an escape hatch for escaping the ship such as change the plan on the go. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.1 - Collaboration aspect of OKR - transparency of key results 
--> 

Consider an OKR that started with an initial objective, such as an objective that was created ahead of any work, such as one that comes from a mission or a vision. It does so with the purpose of pushing the design process of OKR into the modelling, or planning, for the steps that are thought to be steps that pulls the objective closer. 

This part, the Key Results part of OKR, appears first as a mechanism to keep track, that adds transparency, and which reveals what is being done and what is ahead. In additin, it is also a mechanism that offers a window of opportunity to see what goes on and how what is being done connects with where we want to go. Here is where OKR starts to get complicated as, in essence, it's becomes a collaboration mechanism. What I mean by complicated is that much more simpler to simply use OKR for tracking, as in a stream that goes to one direction, than for enabling it as a collaborative communication tool that allows teams to evaluate what they do, to change what they are tracking, if not to chage what they are going after. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.1.1 - Collaboration aspect of OKR  - and case of a book writing 
--> 

Through a case of writing we can see how the mechanis of using key results can be powerful, and where we establish the minimal effort with a maximum impact, through honoring the collaborative process that take place, transparently, honestly. The upfront "daring" accomodation of key results with the open mindset to evaluate is the key. 

First looking at the simpler dimention of OKR, consider when one said that she is to write a book. She expects to deliver pages, or chapters, or to do a number of interviews, to come up with the articles, and to engage in several processes that would bring the objective closer. OKR asks her to pick a few key results that she believes will help. Although OKR doesn't go into strategy, what to pick, it proposes a system where the discussion happens, even for one working alone. If you write it down, and if you set your objectives, and if you set your key results, then you are writing it for the sake of letting collaboration to take place; so that you know, so that you can read, so that you can reflect. Therefore, it is less for the sake of presenting or keeping the score, or for serving as a personal grading for what was performed. It is, instead, for the sake of openning a window, a way to see, a way to talk, a discussin to happen, about the said, or written, key results; as as well the objective since it is all interconnected. With the communication going on, she can run the evaluation cycle and change her OKR for the next cycle. 

This collaborative aspect of OKR, used by organizations that reportedly does well, consider that some of them require individuals to post their OKRs, to share. This situation takes a great culture and great effort in the first place. They report benefits such as when an employee, by knowing what other employee is doing, can offer help indirectly such as to give hints, advices, and new ideas. Moreover, the essence of this is that the doer is okay in the doing of it, even in the early stages, even when mistakes are apparent.

* Outline - Answer k2.1.2 - Course correct - internal market starts with honesty and transparency
--> 

> ".................." 

When exposing what we do, the things we are doing, and letting others chime in to help, even people that are not connected directly, it is natural to consider that the mechanism promotes communication and open ideas to flow in which would result in an opportunity to reduce self bias and improve not only effectiveness, in the sense of performance for what is being done and in the sense of the simpler nature of accounting and tracking, but also taken that this simpler factor is present, the more complex collaborative communication which is the opportunity to evaluate all that is being done. 

Consider that the point about transparency and collaboration has to do not with the benefits like gambling, of one helping with the other, as if people have the clicks, that is a by-product of doing in a collaborative and transparency way. But in addition to that, it is important to recognize that transparency, having things written down, also reveals failure in the eyes of everyone, which could be complicated depending on the effects from the exposure of failure, such as if the protagonists of the failed propositions aren't to be valued. Therefore, in other words, the exposure goes along with the necessity of the right attitude, a system of protection which when exists gains a strategic meaning, as indicated by Michael Dearing, gains a tone of competition, a healthy competition: 

> *"It seems to me that the best product roadmaps come from vigorous internal competition for time and talent from engineering, design, marketing. " Michael Dearing (2016)

The point suggested by Micheal was isnpired from the general point about competition in macro markets (2016) - the situation and acknowledgement that competition drives better results with the rise of the winning competitor. But then, deriving from that, it comes the natural question if any of that is the actual mechanism we use when we come up with a better thing to do in the face of our goals. Perhaps Michael saw the whole world as a one big company which is the analogy for the intercal micro market and the notion of competition. In this model, consider that there is the input of doing, from doing, from vision, from brainstorming, first in the beginning of a process like a funnel. And then, a quantitative and qualitative judgement chimes in which separates the gold from the things that we can separate, as in the data to support recyling it. 

But a quite important aspect of it has to do with the need for transparency and exposure. "Put the roadmap where everyone can see it is one of the most powerful actions a founder can take." (2016) which goes along with " It is to be expected that people who care about what they work on are disappointed when something doesn’t work out the way they wanted. The approach above arms them with the information they need to make sense of the disappointment and to improve the probability that their next ideas will get funded." (2016)

Notice that in the illustration he created the idea of "funded" can be interpreted as approved or the general idea of buy-in.

* Outline - Answer k2.2. - Course correct - Allowing the editor-critic 
--> 

It is valid to assert that OKR, as a framework, promotes the effort of colloration that involves, checking, evaluating, and changing direction. Consider, for example, another aspect of OKR where Key Results - as promoted by the viewpoint of John Doerr - can be defined as aspirational or commitment based. These approaches exist to accommodate the situations where a lot of learning, such as discovery, is involved - commitment based key results offers an approach to check progress for the moments that we know exactly what needs to be done. Again, the applicability and value from it depends on the strategic planning. 

But the evaluation of the what happens, according to the approach, is key and should be likely done at all times. Not only after the fact that when done properly communication and contributions happens indirectly as indicated. The natural execution of it requires constant evaluation that involves self review and peer review, such as a review with a manager. 

<!-- 
@meta @outline 
* Outline - Answer k2.2. - Course correct - Allowing the editor-critic - complication - 
--> 

Of course, depending on the culture, toxic aspects can come the way to influence the process to offer no value. For example, depending on how the measurement of performance of an employee is done, such as when the compensation is associated with the Key Results and moving towards the Objective as written, then the results can be catrastrofic. Would one want to course correct its path, after having good reasons for so, after knowing that she or he could be evaluated as bad performer and even get fired? That kind of situation would certainly bring anxiety and a lot of distractions for a call that would not likely happen. 

It is important to pause here and reflect that a lot of companies indeed enters that mode. They set goals in stone, they put prizes for the ones that follows the path as written, they punish the ones that didn't do well. Then it comes the question, do they course correct? Yes but they do that in macro terms, by facing a crisis, which likely involve getting people fired, managers fired, teams reorganized. From the point of view of an employee, under a whole team that got fired for moving in the bad direction claiming it was good, the employee generally tries to escape the spiral of death by reclaiming that he was told to do that job and was performing well. In a lot of situations like that, a lot of people can get away. But still, anxiety was present and a lot of effort to manage the crisis which can and should be considered a bad use of the time of people. 

Therefore, it is ideal to think that a plan for progressing is not about a plan for evaluating people - as in to consider them in or out the boat. This is a key aspect of the OKR approach that when well considered can make OKR become a useful tool and one that also serves well for course-correcting and actually bringing everyone on board and focusing on what matters. 

With a cadence for evaluating what is being done, with allowance for reviewing with transparency and strategic thinking too, the approach can help person to change the plan at the level of the Key Results and also Objectives.

The effort of redoing the OKR hundreds of times, is for the sake of being open. Now, in this regard, a question that comes is if OKR does not allow room for bottom-up contributions that affects the top-down. Part of it I have covered, the conversation is there. But the cycle for reviewing all the top down plan exists too and bottom-up contributions is recognized as key. In other words, the approach needs and depends on the confrontation of the what we want to do with the what is happening. Of course, the cadence for that sort of strategic planning work might have a cadence, needs a cadence applicable to the organization.

## Outcome vs. Output War and Peace

There are situations that people enter the OKR train is valid, as it stops beautifully on time in the station. It’s a trip with a goal, such as to learn and use OKR in the best way possible. But then we enter in it, the wagon starts smooth and the scenery is beautiful, it’s unbelievable and the roadmap seem to make sense with scenes around. But then, give it some time and housing passing by. Suddenly the lights of the train blinks arbitrarily and we hear something craking as the speed of the train increases fast. A yellow light fades under the seat and people start to be worried. Next stop, unknown, the train enters a tunel, the heater stops working, and it goes on for another 2 hours with the speed increasing. What is next will blow your mind. You can't go back to revisit the trip. You are on it and it is going of the tracks. This is where you start to lose faith in your OKR trip and your training. 

The way that Christina Wodtke puts it in her article - entitled *"Are You Sure You Want to Use OKRs?"* I love it because the actual *Call to Action* calls for a reflection: 

> *"There is a concept I call drift. Drift means that a process has drifted away from the original framing. It happened to Agile. What started as a simple idea that people should work collaboratively and iteratively became people policing each other on the True Agile Way: “this is how to write a user story” and “Stand up can’t be more than 15 minutes long.”"* (Wodtke, 2022)

The complication that I had was that I have identified that OKR learning starts smooth but hits a wall at some point. Not sure if you have seen this but a lot of the OKR articles - and there is a lot of them now trying to help with problems, ambiguities, struggles - sort of gets a bit complicated at a specific point. Things get hard when the learner moves toward the shape/design/model of Key Results. The core of this learning complication, in my opinion, has its epicenter in the Output vs. Outcome discussion.

[1] When John Doerr (and team) launched Measure What Matters, I believe the fight was not there. However, with time, they published their positioning - What Matters: Output vs. outcome with OKRs. https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/outputs-vs-outcome-okr

[2] On the other hand, many product managers (which seems to be the case) are moving their troops using Outcome-oriented thinking. Christina Vodjke, the author of Radical Focus and Stanford Professor, has indicated that Outcome-oriented is better - https://cwodtke.medium.com/you-cant-handle-okrs-5465cf161e81

> *"Key Results need to be outcomes, not outputs. If you make a key result 'launch this feature' and halfway through the quarter you discover it won’t move the number you hoped it would, you’re stuck. You committed to that feature and now you feel like you have to deliver it. But if you pick a number you want to move, you can try dozens of things to change it."* (Wodtke, 2022)

So I was stuck in my small world, preferring a bit towards Output/action, which gives me a way to judge/evaluate actual action strategy. But yet stuck anyway or unhappy with the complexity in the center of this fight, as I have figured. No articles seemed to address the Outcome vs. Output question in the context of management.

* Change this - For OKR, my conclusion would be that the needle, to adjust towards output-based or outcome-based, would depend on what is delivered. For example, if the project in the hands of an individual is very design-oriented where the executor is learning/discovering/stepping into the unknown (old or young), they might consider it output-based. If the project has found direction, then an outcome-based can be handy.

To be fair with Christina, notice that the context may matter. In the above view, she had assummed what she referred as "prep work" which I would then relaltively agree with the idea of key results to have that inclination to outcomes, if you have indeed a crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency: 

> *"Do the prework. Make sure you have a crisp strategy. Make sure your teams have psychological safety. Make sure your product teams are multidisciplinary (Product, Design and Engineering.) Fire bad managers. Adopt Agile and Lean practices. Create as many self-sufficient teams as possible. Value effectiveness over efficiency."* (Wodtke, 2022)

[3] An article that helped me to see the two sides of the spectrum was this one from this guy named Josh Seiden - https://medium.com/@jseiden/to-write-better-okrs-use-outcomes-e82be6e7b460 as he included the cartoon image (Resources -> Activities -> Output -> Outcome -> Impact) which he attributes to "The Project Logic Model, adapted from Kellogg Foundation"

So up to here, I had identified the complication in the learning journey of a founder.Moving towards the potential answer, the following author gave us a cartoon to help us understand Output vs. Outcome, although he promotes Outcome-based for OKR:+ Cartoon is [Resouces -> Activites -> Output -> Outcome -> Impact]https://medium.com/@jseiden/to-write-better-okrs-use-outcomes-e82be6e7b460

The effect of the above writing (and similar thinking) has, IMHO, provoked What Matters folks to position a response:+ Output vs. outcome with OKRs -https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/outputs-vs-outcome-okr

The likely core of the worriness of Christina has to do with the struggle if you are interested in being open about the actual efforts you make. The point of her intention - in my view - has to do with "giving up" a potential challenging part of OKR - to see the output and discuss - and to allow the team to get away, to deal with it. And by the way, the point given in the following interview, she recomments a good brainstorming for the key results design:

The potential toxic by-product, especially if you don't have the maturity view; 

> *"But then a week from now, I’ll see you somewhere and you’ll say something breathtakingly moronic. Something like, “They couldn’t have picked a better headshot, lol?” in a profile of a woman CEO. Or asking, on a panel, “Don’t you think that women founders just pitch differently and that’s why they don’t get funded as often?” Or giving an interview where you solemnly explain, “I don’t see colour when I look at candidates. We’re a meritocracy.” "* (Nightingale, 2017)

#### Recovering the reflective opportunity - The window 

Adjusting Christina's approach to make it work with the output-based, would be about acknowledging first the good intentions in the good not the best: 

>*"The best is the enemy of the good. If you are spending weeks refining the language of the objective and pinning down just the right metrics, your company is in the business of process management. That’s wasteful. Try to make good OKRs but remember there is a time when you have to say, good enough for now. You don’t want to spend three weeks setting your goals and lose the time you could be working toward them instead." (Wodtke, 2022)

But moving forward, the output-based version that is friendly with that can be about the "refining the language of the objective" after the fact that the output is being generated. Or more precisely, the key results being executed, such as action and effort, generates the data, the information, and opportunity. It is the judgement of the effort, a clearly stated effort, that allows the team to do it again, to adjust things. In other words, the adjustment to the key results is the actual opportunity, as we can see, as we can talk about, what is going on. THis is circles back to the points about collaboration from the prior section. 

The idea of using Key Results to quantity success can be dangerous because your objective should be your success. The key results, in the appraoch that is honest and collaborative shall then become the key elements that gives us the opportunity to re-evaluate. The danger of moving straight under the assumption of quantification of success using Key Results [^footnote_christinawodtke_key_results_quantity_success] is that you can miss keep traking of what you are doing, missing the window of opportunity for evaluation, and in the case of weak cultures, this may also become doing things outside the window of what is visible and accountable which is where a lot of people are able to get things done - but there is a price to pay. The price to pay is the inneviable disatisfaction with OKR in general, running with arbitrary investments, the discussions of the real effort and activities happening somewhere else - for example.

The viewpoint given by Reforge is also mature to recognize not only the different kinds of key results but strategic mixing of these kinds to actually improve the deepthness of connection with the purpose, the objectives: 

> *"They come together to paint a picture of what needs to happen for your objective to be successful. .. There are output-metric key results — such as delivering an important feature — as well as outcome-oriented key results. It’s also important to note that outcome-oriented key results can come in two varieties based on the metric within the key result."*

#### Clarity for effort vs. outcome using roles of junior vs. senior 

That shows a complex approach that some of the Mozilla managers had for measuring folks, where "junior people can be measured by effort" while "the outcome can measure senior people."The framing of this last article helped me see correlations with:+ junior/senior+ unknown/known+ divergence/convergence+ aspirational/commitment+ effort/outcomeAnd that helped me to see better that the adjustment of the needle (from action, to output, to outcome) could be done depending on the context of the objective.Therefore, if you don't know much about what you are doing, you can measure by effort and revisit faster (100 times). If you are confident, the measure could be oriented towards an outcome.That could also explain why composed OKR (team level) could be more oriented to outcomes and why an individual could be more oriented to effort. Not sure.

[4] Until today. When I was following the articles in order, you had your "/5" article referring to the "/29" article (Leadership is not about your good intentions / https://mfbt.ca/leadership-is-not-about-your-good-intentions-5e21666cb01b ) which has provoked my mind as I reached the following diagram:

<!--

--> 

* "Junior people we evaluate on effort."
* "Senior people we evaluate on outcomes."

The above blew my mind, my friends. A neuron in a galaxy far away was able to say hi to another neuron in another faraway galaxy.

But it wasn't only that, you kept, in this article, provoking my mind with things such as "who is junior" or "what means junior" or "why?"

Having had a light, I am here pondering one thing as I try to go back to Output vs. Outcome in the context of OKR. Besides the excellent spectrum provided by [3] Seid, this potential addition has to do with the visualization that effort might go along with design/divergent thinking on the one hand. In contrast, the outcome might go along with design/convergent.

As in - open vs. clone

As in - discover vs. execute

As in - aspirational vs. commitment

I do not know if my awakening has a significant flaw, but something seems linear here or structured about the problem.

##### Who is the junior? 

What matters, really, is that you can be just out of the sudden under a need to flip yourself, to embraced a personality, to model it, to consider the maturity level for that task. In other words, no matter how senior you are, you can be a junior at any time depending on your objectives ahead: 

> *"Holding a junior employee accountable for the success of the organization isn’t realistic. Without those strategies, they don’t know how to make success happen. So we substitute in productivity goals, progress goals. Are you writing clean code? Are you collaborating well?"* (Nightingale, 2017)

--> 

##### Rupture and maturity dissonance 

An outcome of setting a mature expectation to your now-junior doer is that you create a maturity dissonance which under the need to keep all strict as "this is the way" you bring about rupture to your working team - and moreover misses the point which is using the effort phase to bring about and to discover maturity: 

> *" When you’re new it’s hard to know the difference between a bad idea, a good idea with the wrong team, and a good team with a bad plan. It encourages people to be hair trigger and awful to each other as a way to seem smart. It encourages other people to leave."* (Nightingale, 2017)

--> 

##### Maturation models 

The model which we aim, which especially is the case for startups, is that the roles are dynamic. The "mature" corporate situation has the light for the solution. If you are mature enough to do that, it is then that you are positioning and understand that there is a way to actually push the outcome you want:

> *"Every company needs a set of folks who do understand the context. Who can be held accountable for the right things actually getting done. That’s what executives are for. You are the people who turn strategy into execution. It’s a hard job. It’s why you get a fancy title and a high salary and a team of people. You need to prioritize, spot problems early, adapt and adjust. You need to empower your teams to be creative, but never step so far away that you lose the thread of how they’ll get it done. "* (Nightingale, 2017)

--> 

This again aligns with the given "prep work" suggested by Christina, in my rewriting, the  "crisp strategy, multidisciplinary team, bad managers fired, agile and lean happening in good share, effectiveness happening over efficiency." (Wodtke, 2022) 

#### If OKR is the roadmap then it's not evaluation of performance 

The idea of not being so hard is exactly about allowing the doer to fail with the key results and reevaluate which key results bring the doer "back into" the promising direction. Now for thre sake of solving the complex question - should I go with outcome or output - and given the point given, we may use, for the sake of the reflection, the advice from the professor of the MWM Course: 

> *"Contribution is not the same as “making your OKRs.” Did this person make smart choices and stay focused on moving the numbers? Did they gain traction? Did they learn what not to do? And not everyone can contribute to OKRs, so you will need something more than “making OKRs” to evaluate them on.*" (Wodtke, 2022)
