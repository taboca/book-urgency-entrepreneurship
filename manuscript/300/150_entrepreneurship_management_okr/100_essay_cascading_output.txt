## Considerations about cascading expectations and managerial involvement 

If people work for others, as subordinates, and if the output of their managers are the output of the organization under them [^foonote_andygrove_managersoutput], then if also all of them make their objectives and key results clear to each other, it would be then be unescapable that something expected as key results from the managers would actually appear through the OKR plans of the subordinates. Or, from another view of the narrative, the manager is interested in knowing if the output given by the organization - that he is responsible for - works to pull his higher-order objectives closer. 

And, moreover, not only interested - as in curious - which would be related to the interests of tracking and monitoring, but also willing and feeling responsible - in a way or another - and aware of its participation, conscious, that he has to be involved in the assessment and the process of management and planning that helps to the organization under which is the essential fundamental unit which will bring about change to his own objectives. 

This interest and involvement is not only practical because of the implicit cascaded nature of the organization which and where the hierarchy of the doers go along with a hierarchical structure of expectations. It also becomes practical because there is an implicit allowance to the top-down vs. bottom-up discussion and conversation. 

When the view of maturity - that understanding of what works and what doesn't work - is passed to the subordinate but it is also provoked under the realities of an uncertain path in the view of what is ahead, the expected change. What comes from this situation - especially if we are interested in improving the organization, is not the mere and simplistic and anti-synergic view, if not lazy, that the managers key results boils down to the straight objectives of their subordinates; for example: 

> "My 3 key results are: A - make sure that subordinate A had completed his objectives. B - make sure that subordinate B has completed her objectives. C - make sure that subordinate C has completed her objectives. " 

If I were to simplify to that level it would be about reducing my role of a manager to the one that is interested in monitoring outcomes with no regard to the struggles. Therefore, and, as expected and indeed; the "outcome-based" simplification would not allow the manager to get involved beyond tracking. Now, under the view that the output of the manager is the output of the organization under, we are to actually recognize that the manager sees through, and is involved with, as in: 

> "I expect that what you do can be done in a wat that we can both know what is being done; in a a way that we can both talk about, such as to talk about if what is being done is being done in a healthy way that is helping your objectives." 

And implied in the such a viewpoint, necessarily the manager transcends from expecting numbers to getting involved in the discussion wherre the doer's ability, and development, and health, is taken in consideration; and moreover the discussion if the subordinate objectives do contribute accross the manager objectives towards the higher-order institution, organization, the synergic involvement of the manager becomes one that looks up from bottom-up and top-down, is concerned with its healthy, but also looks up from the top-down that respects the above objectives and resources, looking for the synergic aggregation of the whole but doing so would also open the space for the often necessary aspects of change, to which needs to happen where the ideal operationalization of the underlying and above structures does not bring about the expected movement toward the objectives. 

This is, ultimatelly, the manager's call. This inclination would allow room for the high-producing manager  - the one that is in essence allowing room for an influence that comes from the bottom up. Indeed, if she only expects, she would then become useless, a micro manager, and one that would not recognize or listen to anything from the bottom-up, would them be wasterd - or bypassed - when innevitable truths arrive, from the sides, the external world, they would naturally be replaced. 

Now, when the manager, or high producing manager, supports the subordinates to have influence, she brings about the value in the conversation and brings about the point of Andy Grove where the output of the manager is the output of the organization under her. This is also true if we consider that the "smaller" units under one, from a cascaded perspective, or a choreographical need, will rocognize that the undeerlying movements are more active or that they show more interaction, more action, more impulses, more conversations, more nuances, more conflicts, more heat; which naturally sets the managerial role and effort to get involved with the job and the need of seeking coherence and working to understand the meaning of the "heated" discussions under in the light of the horizon and pusposeful goals; which naturally sets them to bring about a more organized, more concise, more coherent, more choreographed narrativew, or from a composer's point of view where the "whole phrase" becomes clear where the underlying impulsed where reduced. Consider the quote from Benhamin Zander: 

> "" [Benjamin Zander says that the power of the composer depends on the power of the players.] Benjamin Zander

Another implied comlpication of the anti-synergic view - the output-based cascating - where the manager can't be "in" and where the subordinate can't be "out" and where the bottom-up does not come to encounter the top-down; is that it allows room for the secrets to rise and impact anyway the organization because of the implied dichotomy as all that there is to do resumes to all that was told to do, which goes back to the likelyhood of the illustration given of the doer, the subordinate, bypassing the managers; or in the face of the insolvency an unexpected necessity of change the out of the sudden request from top-down to change direction. 

This situation would be about - bring about - the conflict between the involved where what benefits one doesn't benefit the other. An illustration from Maslow shall support our enlightened view: 

* "Synergy is more holistic, and the more holistic is more synergic. .. The more holistic a structure is operationally, that is, the more mutual interdependence there is, the better the communication, etc., etc., the more the team has to rely on each other - for instance as in a basketball team - the more synergic everything will be. Maybe I can take the example of a barketball team which is composed ...  " Abraham Maslow (Maslow on Management, p.123)
