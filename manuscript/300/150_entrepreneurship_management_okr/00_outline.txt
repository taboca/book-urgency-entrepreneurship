## Outline v0.5 

* Strategy - #editing #editor-williamzinsser - Moving the clear picture quotation of "Making up as you go" [feat. F & H @ Basecamp] before the abstraction and reflective quotation of them. This goes well with the recommendation from William Zinsser for explaining scientific subjects. 

* Outline - Introduction - Leading pitch - Gettings done is known that solves entrepreneurship in contrast with invention and other methods that improves the conditions [feat. Schumpeter]; But since getting things done can't be arbitrary, goal-setting and goal-progress rises. It's not for no reason - we are all dying to know how we can do the best thing possible and come up with impact. As we do, it's innevitable in the modern days to come accross with many methods, ideas, advices, and frameworks to help with getting things done. Management continues to work - in a macro context - and the challenges are lively being explored. How can methods or frameworks for getting things done help? Do they help or harm? 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Situation - It's unescapable - the more success we have the more we will love to track our progress, to keep ambitious goals set in advance, to have clarity about the goals and how to get there. And even if the path is uncertain, to have a clear plan even when the plan is - I have to learn. But it may not be clear the impact of goal tracking and goal progressing in the beginning when one is not proficient in the art and science of management by objectives. 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Situation - Our solutions for goal tracking and measuring progress towards objectives seem to fail, to a point we can be confused. [feat. F&H @ Basecamp]

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Complication - We struggle with the thing in the middle, the execution; We may doubt that a method for progressing with goals helps for when the path is uncertain? 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Question Answer - Introduction - #SCqA - Question Answer - What is it so hard? The urge to do it fast and make things right? We will consider that being hard on goals, such as following blindly is an issue; We will consider how OKR helps with goal progressing, with a not so radical focus view. @meta-refid 875-834-923-933

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - General answer - We will consider OKR, since it is real, and the reflections on it since it is widely discussed. As many can use anytyhing in anyway they want, the valid reflection would be then to keep the concerns about challenges and risks. One, progress of goals can start wth ambitious goals, and the meaning and complications of top-down; If OKR helps with course-correction; and lastly to recognize complications of measuring when what is being done may involve aspirations and learning more than specific commiments of pure execution to what is known.

## Outline v0.4 

* Strategy - the points from J&F has to be brought up, as they are generic and makes a better motivation to the chapter, this would make the K1 have a smaller introduction, which makes sense because it is huge now. In addition, this will take us to remove the parts of the photo montage of Eric Ries, which is quite arbitrary. 

* Outline - Introduction - Leading pitch - Gettings done is known that solves entrepreneurship in contrast with invention and other methods that improves the conditions [feat.

## Outline v0.3 --------------------------------

## Outline v0.2

* Potential insight - How to measure goals if innovation path is a path of uncertainty? where objectives change? Consider, for example, aspirational goals.

* Outline - Introduction - Leading pitch - It's natural part of execution to measure. But can we measure the path towards innovation where aspirational goals exist? And can measure affect results?
