## Outline v0.4 

* Strategy - the points from J&F has to be brought up, as they are generic and makes a better motivation to the chapter, this would make the K1 have a smaller introduction, which makes sense because it is huge now. In addition, this will take us to remove the parts of the photo montage of Eric Ries, which is quite arbitrary. 



## Outline v0.3 --------------------------------

* Outline - Introduction - Leading pitch - Gettings done requires measuring, in a way or another. But measuring is challenging as it affects the plan towards the outcome. You have to fail objective must change, key results must change. Can measure work for aspirational and objectives in the path of uncertainty?

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Situation - Our solutions for goal tracking and measuring progress towards objectives seem to fail, to a point we can be confused. 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Complication - We struggle with the thing in the middle, the execution; We may doubt that a method for progressing with goals helps for when the path is uncertain? 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Question Answer - Introduction - #SCqA - Question Answer - What is it that set us to use goal setting and measuring in wrong ways? We will consider that being hard on goals and following blindly is an issue; We will consider how OKR helps with goal progressing, not so radical focus. @meta-refid 875-834-923-933

## Outline v0.2

* Potential insight - How to measure goals if innovation path is a path of uncertainty? where objectives change? Consider, for example, aspirational goals.

* Outline - Introduction - Leading pitch - It's natural part of execution to measure. But can we measure the path towards innovation where aspirational goals exist? And can measure affect results? 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Situation - Our solutions for goal tracking and measuring progress towards objectives seem to fail, to a point we can be confused. 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Question Answer - What is it that set us to use goal setting and measuring in wrong ways? We will consider that being hard on goals and following blindly is an issue; Use OKR as a reflection for a goal progressing not so radical focus. 

* Outline - Answer k1 - Can goal setting survive? Making up as you go seems to be real, in contrast with crazy goals?
* Outline - Answer k1.1 - Top-down matters? 
* Outline - Answer k1.1.1 - Some goals are present anyway

## Outline v0.1 

* Outline - Introduction - Leading pitch - Gettings done requires measuring, in a way or another. But measuring also affects the effect potential. 
* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Situation - Making up as you go seems to be real, in contrast with crazy goals?
* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Complication - maybe we will see means more, reflective though
* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Complication - OKR could be dropped? Or done without a perspective?
* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Answer? OKR and course correction
