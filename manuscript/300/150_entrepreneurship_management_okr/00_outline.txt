## Outline v0.4 

* Strategy - the points from J&F has to be brought up, as they are generic and makes a better motivation to the chapter, this would make the K1 have a smaller introduction, which makes sense because it is huge now. In addition, this will take us to remove the parts of the photo montage of Eric Ries, which is quite arbitrary. 

* Outline - Introduction - Leading pitch - Gettings done is known that solves entrepreneurship; in contrast with invention and other methods that improves the conditions; But there are challenges to innovate, does measuring influences innovation? How can methods and frameworks for getting things done help and do they help? 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Situation - Goal tracking and goal progressing exists, under managemnt by objectives, OKR in the days; 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Situation - Our solutions for goal tracking and measuring progress towards objectives seem to fail, to a point we can be confused. [feat. F&H @ Basecamp]

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Complication - We struggle with the thing in the middle, the execution; We may doubt that a method for progressing with goals helps for when the path is uncertain? 

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - Question Answer - Introduction - #SCqA - Question Answer - What is it so hard? The urge to do it fast and make things right? We will consider that being hard on goals, such as following blindly is an issue; We will consider how OKR helps with goal progressing, with a not so radical focus view. @meta-refid 875-834-923-933

* Outline - Introduction - #SCqA - General answer - We will consider OKR, since it is real, and the reflections on it since it is widely discussed. As many can use anytyhing in anyway they want, the valid reflection would be then to keep the concerns about challenges and risks. One, progress of goals can start wth ambitious goals, and the meaning and complications of top-down; If OKR helps with course-correction; and lastly to recognize complications of measuring when what is being done may involve aspirations and learning more than specific commiments of pure execution to what is known.

## Outline v0.3 --------------------------------

## Outline v0.2

* Potential insight - How to measure goals if innovation path is a path of uncertainty? where objectives change? Consider, for example, aspirational goals.
