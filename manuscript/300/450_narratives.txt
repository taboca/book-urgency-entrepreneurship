# The Narrative Dilemma 

In this chapter, we will look at entrepreneurs as storytelling animals and reflect if storytelling eats strategy for breakfast[^footnote_andygrove_peterdrucker]. The storytelling aspect, ahead of us, is less communication materials such as presentations. We will focus on the narratives of the everyday - what we experience and tell - and the possibility of a narrative rationality that can influence how we reason and act.  

[^footnote_andygrove_peterdrucker]: Andy Grove quoted Peter Drucker's famous quote that "culture eats strategy for breakfast" in the book High Output Management. 

The situation - decide based on narratives of the day that when experienced and told seem to fit perspectly and seem like rational arguments, it aligns with our needs in terms of urgency, it boosts us towards our goals. But these narratives of the average day sums up and builds a storied context that pushes us to difficult places. We not only act based on daily narratives, thinking that it serves a rational plan, but when we look back, we miss how influential these narratives were in terms of building up our decision making process and influencing the team's decision making process. The complication - for entrepreneurs - is that as much as it seems absurd after we look in restrospect, we continue to decide based on narratives of the day that when experienced and told seem to fit perspectly and seem like rational arguments, it aligns with our needs in terms of urgency, it boosts us towards our goals.

The complication is that, in other words, how we deal with narratives is generally not considered, or accounted. Or more precisely, the consideration if we reason and act on the basis of narratives is not given the right amount of attention. When we look at anything from a narrative view, we might see traints like good intentions, style of the narrator, account the character of who narrates, generally moving our attention to argument. As if we check the "letters" that we exchange and see that it comes with color, energy, emphasis, and emotions. We take these traits as good things that some of the us can do, that it convinces, it motivates, like a grease in the engine that we depend on it. Or, on the other hand when these traits don't work, there is room for improvement, it was not catchy to convince, in extreme cases it might be toxic communication. 

The question is, first, why we ignore that the narratives of the day might have a great deal of influence in building a storied context that might push us in certain directions? Why we continue to not see the power of the narratives of the day and its bias impact? 

The direction we are going, to consider the narratives of the average day, we will reflect on that as we have here the license to look a us as beings that are driven by narratives in the first place, especially entrepreneurs. We will start by considering how the setting is a perfect place for a narrative rationality, because of it's urgent nature, of its decision-based nature, its transactional nature. With that we will look at the narrative paradigm and rationality of Walter Fisher and then elaborate more about the why teams come up with certain languages, or narratives, that seem so appropriate, that seems so catchy. 

My hope is that if we reflect about our natural way we engage with storytelling, we can improve our awareness that our decisions are made based on the not so logical and highly subjective narratives, which should put us in a humble, and smarter, position of improved responsibility for what we experience and tell, therefore more open, more reflective, about the influence of storytelling and the impact to what we do.  

## The language of action  

This section celebrates how we experience narraties in a team setting, and should help us to consider how what we experience and tell affects what we do. Let's first consider how words are the building blocks of our movement as teams, an how the setting of mdoern entrepreneurship pulls the team to move faster, such as so fast to not even notice how we are driven by words, and by a language of the hour, how we have automated of decision making. 

Let us start by a context of the kind of the narratives of the corporate setting via appreciating a concern given by the founders of Basecamp, Jason and David. In their book *It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work* (2018), they call our attention to a kind of language that the business world is obsessed with, which for them is "a paradigm which does not make sense." They call our attention to action-oriented narratives that invite us to act. These can be identified in messages such as "Let's double the market?", "Who is getting which awards?", "Who is raising money?", and so on. 

> *"Sadly, it's not easy to escape the business tropes of war and conquest. Every media outlet has a template for describing rival companies as warring factions. Sex sells, wars sell, and business battles serve as financial-page porn."*
>
> (2018, P.21)

The statement from Basecamp worked for me as a great motivation to the theme and it is an opening to a reflection about narratives in the work day. Starting with the fact that what we get from the media, or what is caught by the limelight, is what sells more; as opposed to the boring language of the real work or what looks at the failures of the day. Another element is their association with the idea of conquest. Indeed, the visceral messages we find elsewhere seems to motivate us to an action as these messages promisses results. In other words, narratives are appealling and prompt us to action as it gives us the idea of the prize for when action is taken. Another factor, which might be less strict although quite influential, is that a "let's double the market" appeals to good intentions, that might call for a energetic move which may, in the end, moves the neddle even a little bit. Another element is also an implied comparison or analogy checking mechanism - consider that we our likeness to ignore a "let's multiply the market by 3.1415" goes along with the fact that we don't know any superstar team that has suceeeded with that rule. In other words, the "let us double the market" generally comes with a supporting line "like the Uber of X did it." These elements together are key so that we can find ourselves paying attention, enjoying, and engaging with the matter, the action that is being called. 

> *Cartoon strip. Strip one: A lot of heads are listening, a presentation in front of them, the chart shows the way up and a saying - let us double the market. Strip two one hand is raised and asks "Why double and not triple?". The third strip the speaker replies "Because The Uber of Dog Walking has doubled it. Strip four: yeah and plus is a lot of less work. Lots of others say good good. Deal. "* Marcio Galli cartoon as text. 

That language of war and conquest, or as David and Jason referred as "a paradigm which does not make sense," set us in the right place to reflect if there is something more, especially in the setting of entrepreneurship, that accounts narratives as part of how we reason and act. 

Now the question is how this sort of language really appears in the average day, and if it is pervasive and impactful. Is it as simple as a sort of language that a CEO uses, here and there, and then the effects comes as in influencing the key results and activities of everyone under? 

If we consider any language being used, and the entrepreneurial setting where actions happens everyday and which happens fast, we should consider the lots of messages that are being exchanged. Now, it should be noted, that the entrepreneurial setting is not of actors. Thus it is likely that any observation of dramas generally experienced are less related to real life and more with the sort of  dramas between the life of executing activities and expectations such as risk ahead. As in, we if do things that way, we may not survive - not in the sense of people dying but in the sense of the team being dismantled, the project being killed, the current effort over, the startup to die fast or slow. 

But as we dig into considering the bits and pieces of narratives given in the average day, it comes first that we shall look at the setting - not to say stage - of entrepreneurs, the nature of how a context of the actual work happens, the setting that asks decisions. We know, it's situational, that teams will start moving fast, and commmunicating even faster. The general notion that they talk in a room, as opposed to going through complexities of communication systems, is observed as more present in smaller settings, such as what the Blitzscaling materials refers as tribe: 

> "" Quote from Chris Yeh and Reid Hoffman. 

It comes form this notion the setting where what is being experienced and told has high impact potential. One presents a narrative, which is likely seen as an agument, the team adds value to it such as to improve, to deny, directions are taken. And it happens a lot. Now, keeping the setting pinned, on one hand, we might celebrate the setting of rhetorical logic and and its potential in for speeding up decisions in the average day: 

> "Classical tradition in rhetoric provides assistance in making this judgement by assessing that, in controversies, arguments, and counterarguments, come to "stands" or stases - points of impasse that must be resolved, before argumentation can continue toward decision. " (p.194)

Consider the potential parallel realities of a team and even a propensity for advancing based on decisions as in right or left, in the following cartoon. 

> "Cartoon of one team, deciding asking with self, then moves to two people, decide, and to three, decide. " Cartoo of Marcio 

The considerations about how we experience narratives puts myself in a good position to first say thanks to a hero of communication, which I like to see him as a hero of entrepreneurship, professor Walter Fisher, and second to invite you to consider the idea of the narrative paradigm, from his book entitled Human Communication as Narration; that explores the nature of reason and rationality in our communicative experiences. In other words, how do people come to believe and to act; which should give us insights to reflect if narratives are influential in entrepreneur's decision making. 

## The narrative rationality 

In the context of entrepreneurship, in the end of the day, we generally think that communication serves humans as rational beings. Meaning that communication, such as the communication involved in decision-making, is argumentative. With such a view, it is okay to assume that communication in the entrepreneurial setting serves the team's rational purpose of entrepreneurship. This comes from a familiar paradigm in the west, the rational-world paradigm. 

Thus with a view that communication serves rationality, and considering team collaborators are good, such as capable, we can't avoid simply noticing the beauity of a rhetorical logic which goes well with the indicated notion from the prior quote where "arguments, and counterarguments" comes across the "points of impasse"  that must be resolved. And it does seem that there is nothing wrong with that as it gives us a collaborative potential for doing things fast, especially when team collaborators are good. 

Our propensenty to think that arguments are rational, as in transparently argumentative, is not unfundamented.  For example, consider elaborated presentations such as which are given to teams or others such as customers or investors. Imagine a founder that does a presentation, such as an elevator pitch[^elevatorpitch], to an investor. She works hard in her presentation doing its best to organize the problem she has - the reason for receiving support - with an idea that the presentation shall help with persuasion, with clarity, with supporting data given as key elements and where if not present the result could end up as the audience not getting and then less able to judge and accept which might mean a denial. In other words, if storytelling as a tool where then quality matters and can affect how one understands the truths behind. 

[^elevatorpitch]:

But going back to the arguments of the day, the narratives of the day, such what colleagues exchanges in the entrepreneurial setting that demands a forward movement. In this setting, the rational-world view acts accordinly - it expects that the narratives of the day are carriers of arguments based on a rational logic. Therefore, and similar to the elaborated case, of presentations, we can't blame ourselves when we see that the message does the service of supporting the audience to experience truths so that something can be solved, such as a decision is made. And it is even not complicated to sense that, isn't it? As the shorter it is the narrative, the team would be more apt to identify any exageration of storytelling, isn't it?   

This idea which is quite strong, support us to consider the reality being exposed by the narrative and not account that the narrative is, in a way, an interface that it influences how we experience what is being exposed, that influences our reasoning. The irony, and sad reality, is that a good narrative goes along with our reasoning on that narrative and it does such as good job that we miss entirely noticing our narrative-based reasoning that happens, just like when an user experience designer claims that the best user experience is not visible and allows for the user to access the solution.

> Cartoon strips. Strip one, sir I have a message for you, they are coming our way. Strip two: King replies: Should I kill you then?. Strip three: Well, if they are coming for war, I could, for example, later inform you about their weapons. Strip three: King shoots and says "Send another messenger to check on their weapons." Marcio's cartoon.  

The good news is that this is such an efficient mechanism. When a good storyteller crafts a narrative for the sake of convincing the team about something, and enables everyone to find good reasons for so, the team jumps straight to visualize the matter, the concretes of an argument; which comes with something ahead, a clear view of what is next. They feel indeed a "good job of pulling these things out so that we are able to see," and indeed they sense these where elements of narrative that enabled them to see the reality. Like a door. 

The bad news, and the catch, is that we miss the storytelling acting in realtime, and how the presence - or the lack - of those good reasons would have influenced that decision. If we assume that any narrative is essentially serving a rational logic, as in to persuade or convince or that it carries rational arguments, we are then looking at such this other aspect and likely in a place to dismiss a rationality system that depends on the narrative itself. With that, things are either accepted or denied in general. And when accepted, or denied, the team assumes it is logical and moves on to the next step.

In other words, a complication, while entrepreneurs advance with what they think as logic arguments, practitioners or mentors or anyone at a distanced view, such as an analysis in retrospect, recognize our prior movements of following instincts or like indicated the presence of certain language that brings the team into the later assessment such as "we sensed something wrong about that but we didn't see." As rational-world view puts the limelight in certain elements such as the concretes - such as possible interpretation of methods, good and bad behaviors in terms of applicability, bad data, inability to detect signal from noise, these sort of things - the consideration of the presence of a narrative element falls as a secondary, or less important, although notions related to communication are accounted with signs like great communication, bad communication, toxic communication or some aspects of communication associated with culture are noticed. 

The contrasting view, the narrative paradigm, accepts the idea that rationality fails to be present in the everyday argument and yet we advance decisions with a logical reasoning process. Consider the metaphor used by Walter, of the Homo narrans ("storytelling human") as beings that coordinates meaningful communication via storytelling and where they participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. The reason, my own good reasons here that I am thankful for the work of Walter Fisher, is because it helps me to reflect about how entrepreneurs decide with a highly efficient decision making process - which might even be seen as instinctive - in the lifecycle of a team. Consider the advice that Paul Graham has offered to founders that joined the Y Combinator accelerator program: 

> *"The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least pause before making them. When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore. It's really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes they're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come back a year later and say 'I wish we'd listened.'"*
> 
> (Graham, 2014)

What there is more of Paul Graham which can be another hint for how we engage with our instincts: 

> *"You can, however, trust your instincts about people. And in fact one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to do that enough. They get involved with people who seem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings personally. Later when things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."*
> 
> (Graham, 2014)

The line of reflection from the experience indicated, where startups tend to follow instincts, results in lots of trouble which would be prevented if they could, for example, see from above or, as indicated by Paul Graham, getting advice from a certain special body of knowledge, such as advice from top accelerator program. On the people front, not in contradiction, when a startup is not complying with the long-run follow-through with people, such as stumbling on people that seem impressive, again, trouble might find their way. 

So I would summarize a bit of the situation in the introduction and the situation of advice for founders starting the YCombinator program. The situation of the language of war, or conquest, is pointed the Basecamp folks as a language that is present in the corporate environment. On the other hand, Paul Graham confirms the founders following instincts. These elements, although not necessarity calls our attention for rationality with communication, put us in the position to ask the question: What is the actual rationality being used? And what is it that seems to be rational in the on the go, so technical sometimes, that make us decide. A motivation to be considered is then a question that comes after looking in retrospect which might support us to see that we moved, in the first place, we decided. And we did with things we had and mostly that we have are things that are seeing as arguments, messages of day, narratives. And the indeed, whatever it is, the fact is that it provoke practitioners and managers of entrepreneurship, such as Paul Graham, David and Jason, not only into reflections but to assert what seems to be a phenomenon which is present, even present among quite prestigious teams, even in groups where smart people are part of teams.  

A key value from Walter's work that should be appreciated, is how we as human beings decide based on narratives because our reasoning uses a narrative rationality. Althoght this rationality affects our decisions based on what we experience and tell, we generally can't see it in action. It's seamless. Even when we are hurt, we again and again, miss looking at it.   

### Narrative rationality 

The views of professor Walter accomodates that teams are driven by storytelling because they are all storytellers. This is our opportunity to reflect about a kind of rationality that entrepreneurs naturally use to deal with messages that pushes the average day of entrepreneurial action - the arguments of the day. We will see how the narrative paradigm, and especially its narrative rationality, gives us a light to consider our decision reasoning and making, especially in the setting that is goal-oriented, solutions-based, and where forwardness is a must. [^footnote_walterfisher_transactional_orientation].

[^footnote_walterfisher_transactional_orientation]: The narrative rationality is highly applicable to the setting where arguments appear and where an audience is in front of a decision to be made. The narrative paradigm and narrative rationality elaborates about our mechanism for reasoning and acting based on what we experience and tell. The environment of entrepreneurs, such as the domain of startup execution, is a place where communication appears to be political, in the sense of referring to the future in the face of propositions to change the future, and appears to be forensic, in the sense that biographic and established values are constantly brought up to make the case for decisions ahead. 

It should also be accounted that the situations that we are looking into, such as the "language of war" as indicated by Basecamp reveals the a domain of urgency. Again, their book title is "It doesn't have to be crazy at work." The setting and the audience of Paul Graham where founders that joined the YCombinator acceleration program.
I am assuming that the audience is of one that is executing and learning, that does not know the rules of execution for what is ahead. 

What is not visible about narratives comes from the ironical fact that storytelling works so well that we miss the insight that our ability to fall, such as follow instincts, comes from an actual rationality. That is not to imply that we love to use good stories to justify our actions with no regard to rationality based in logic. The problem, and opportunity for reflection, is that the narrative paradigm and its rationality, has logical principles: 

> *"The narrative paradigm proposes that human beings are inherently storytellers who have a natural capacity to recognize the coherence and fidelity of stories they tell and experience."* (Fisher, 1989, p. 24).

For Walter Fisher, narrative rationality is not arbitraty, it has logical principles, and it is structured how we do that. We reason about a message considering the narrative coherence and narrative fidelity. In general, coherence might be less analytical aspect (check this) and involves how we check a message as coherent, how it seems to be valid to the situation and context that demands the decision. Sometimes what was said seems to apply so well in a context, although we know that we gotta check further to see if it is totally true or not. The fidelity assessment is that other part, a sort of search we do for evidence so that what seems coherent is actually valid. 

For the aspect of coherence, Walter has indicated 3 main elements are used: 

* Argumentative or structural coherence 
* Material coherence 
* Characterological coherence - This is key difference with traditional logic, according to Walter Fisher. 

[P. 62, 64]

As an example, when we engage with people, such as listening to their impressive inputs, we are assessing first listening the who says, the analysis of character, then what was said, if it sounds coherent, and further checks that seeks good reasons. In other words, and quite logical, a lot that goes on in the average day, especially among technical teams, is not double checked really. Messages just seem to make sense exactly because the audience also does its part. 

The advice from Paul Graham, applicable for considering, and reasoning, in the face of these instinctive movements, might as well support the idea that the domain of a startup actually advances on basis of a narrative rationality as opposed to other kinds of rationality. When he states that "YC partners warn founders about mistakes they're about to make," he implies that advice from a great accelerator program, sort of Y Combinator, is, or would and should be, applicable to save them from their poor judgements, referred as instintictive moments. Similarly, when he confirms that founders engage with listening impressive people, it also implies that they followed advice based on what they perceived as good reasons to move on, to decide. Therefore, it comes from that that how teams perceive advice matters, aside from the fact that the quality of advice matters, and aside from the cognitive function that can reach out to further truths to check quality. In addition, his view is an evidence that YC advice does not show a recipe for escaping instincts, such as one that is fully logical and non-network dependent, such as one that is based on analysis. In addition, notice that a lot of founders that gets into accelerator programs, such as ones like known as of the highest quality, like Y Combinator, are in fact greatly filled with technical founders, that they are recognized as highly talented and technical cofounders, not counting the network of Y Combinator which is recognized as a key differential in the lifecycle of a startup and shows a highly level of cognition for analysis for matters considered as rational matters, logic matters, general wisdom. 

### The logic of good reasons  

For the sake of structuring the situation communication of entrepreneurs - the environment where they experience listening and where they tell - we can establish that some kind of analysis in retropect happens somewhere in the future, in the face of their objectives. Paul Graham's exhibition of "I wish we'd listened" shows a pattern of a later judgement that appears when more validation comes their way. This idea also goes along with the expected idea of growth which ties with a measurement evaluation of growth. 

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth."* 
> (Graham, 2012)

<!-- 
Graham, P. (2012, September). Startup = Growth. Retrieved August 29, 2023, from http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html
--> 

Another aspect to be noted is the implied notion that for every single thing that they didn't listened seems to correlate with something else that they have listened, which goes along with the following of instints. Another factor in the setting is that decision making happens on the basis of active listening - from sources from their networks - such as from people sources, sources where impression is likely a function. Now, it should be accounted, or reccounted here, that the world of modern startup is dynamic and that founders are navigating, either directly or indirectly, in a digital world as they execute their process. In other words, the pace of interactivity and the iterative nature of modern startup development brought founders to navigate with through shorter projects and consequently more decision making that happens in realtime with what happens. That, as opposed to a more reflective situation of a team that puts their heads down to write a full 250-page business plan likely involved in longer analysis and a focused effort before showing results. In addition to any networks informing them, we should also account that teams are now moving, advancing, with the support of lean movements that promotes lots of interaction on their way.

Plus it should be accounted that the availability of data is also likely present and cheap to access. That data, or what appears to be data, that is easily acessible and might support startup needs as needs happens on their way. In other words, it is easier now to get advice, free advice, using networks and a web of data. It easier to match advice with methods and then advice plus methods plus data. It is easier to search for "a solution" or for "good reasons" just like a person with a difficult condition might engage with searches as opposed to consulting a doctor. Althought it might seem odd that a smart team working in a startup to be compared with an average person that is suffering, or vulnerable, and engages in naively trusting data from elsewhere; the perspective provided by Walter does not exclude smart people from the situation and in fact accomodates well how experts are likely able to fall, such as trusting instincs, as they are equally equipped with the logic of good reasons. 

And it should be noted the obvious, that all of this is good and meant to accelerate, and which goes without saying that the quality of the process depends on judgment, in the end of the day. But let's keep a possibility, that a full rational verification such as one that oversees what goes on, might not find its place til later especially inthe heat of urgency. 

Now, the engine of the informed narrative rationality depends on what Walter referred as the logic of good reasons. Thus the assessment of coherence put us in the good position to - say pay attention and then to - test the aspects of fidelity of the outstanding message. This second check is the test we naturally do, in terms of "whether or not the stories they experience ring true with the stories they know to be true in their lives. " (Fisher, 1989, p. xxx). 

In other words, our logic for adhering to the advice depends on warrants. Good reasons are these warrants. Walter have used the word warrant in the sense of what authorizes, sanctions, or justifies belief, attitude, or action. (Fisher, 1989, p.107). 

Now, the exercise, reflective, about how we seek for fidelity, according to Walter there is a 5 fold component for the logic of good reasons: fact, relevance, consequence, consistency, and transcendent issue. 

* Fact - are there implicit and explicit values in the message? 

* Relevance - "are the values appropriate to the nature of the decision that the message bears upon" p. 109 this also involves checking if values are omitted, distorted, or misrepresented. 

* Consequence - "What would be the effects of adhering to the values?" [Adds "for one s concept of oneself, for ones behavior, for one s relationships with others and society, and to the process of rhetorical transaction?" P 109

* Consistency - "Are the values confirmed or validated in one's personal experience, in the lives or statements of others whom one admires and respects, and in a conception of the best audience that one can conceive?" P. 109

* Transcendent issue - *Even if a prima-facie case exists or a burden of proof has been established, are the values the message offers those that, in the estimation of the critic, constitute the ideal basis for human conduct? " p. 109

As it is noticeable, these criteria for assessing good reasons, a logic, accepts higher degrees of subjectivity which unveils that a logic of asssessing good reasons to be dependent on values. This aspect of the logic suggest to us that if people use a logic of good reasons that embraces values in its logic, such as highly subjective values, then the consequence would perhaps involve the possibility (not to say absurdity) that humans adhere to things being experienced and told by listening to signals that appeals to some higher known values, such as even love, that pushes them to listen, trust, and agree/disagree, and decide. Yes, the narrative rationality accomodates that viewpoint, it's a highlight: 

> *"One can be fairly "objective" about what values are in fact present in a message, but as one moves to the questions of relevance, effects, confirmation, and ideals, greater and greater degrees of 'subjectivity' enter into the assessment. The intrusion of such 'subjectivity' is not a fault in a logic of good reasons. Instead, it is recognition of the very nature of human communication, and of the nature of subjects amenable to rhetorical expression. "* (Fisher, 1989, p. 110)

#### Notes about the team situation 

* Check - p. 136 - the thing with love more than justice. 

Now, we shall also consider that the very basic mechanism of narrative in decision-oriented messages, that carries the logic of good reasons, is also used by any other participant in the team. Walter acknoledges that "The discourse that constitutes an interpreter's or critic's exploration of the values in messages will also inevitably express values. " (p.109)

In other words, and especifically in the collaborative setting, another factor of narratives has to do with how other participants chime in with their own logic of good reasons, in front of an outstanding message; with the intention to help the team to make a decision, a call, in the face of the clock that is ticking, so that others can chime in and the decision happens more effectively. 

[Consider here a cartoon of the founder that came from outside the building, and has asked the team to pivot. And the next strip the cofounders just say - No no, 72h rule, shut up and let us continue. Notice that cofounders might be adding "good reasons" from Steve Blank which might exercise implictly some of the good reasons attributes such as consistency, and even transcendent values.  ]

(Consider to add love) He goes on "I agree with Perelman's view on the necessity of recognizing and accepting pluralism. However, I would place love as the highest virtue or motivation in life, displacing justice from the pinnacle in the hierarchy of values. Love provides the ground of being and is the motive that should inform all others in human decision making in action. Perelman may well have agreed with this idea, and he could have then argued, rightly I think, that justice is a form of love, that civic love is way of honoring the dignity and worth of individuals and ensuring by rule their well-being in society. " P 137

( Consider the sitution of challenge with Arun. )

( "Finally, I believe that rhetoricians an obligation to inform students and to raise the consciousness of citizens about the nature and functions of values just as we have informed them about the nature and functions of reasons. " p.106 ) 

( Testable - "Reasons can appear in and through arguments, metaphors, myths, gestures, and other means of creating communicative relationships. In sum, to view communication through the perspective of narrativity, is to focus on message, on the individuated forms that constitute it, and in the reliability, trustworthiness, and desirability of what is said - evaluated by using the tests of narrative rationality." p.143 )

In concluding this section, consider that the narrative paradigm, and its rationality based on narratives, works as an opportunity for us to reflect, about what are the mechanisms that we use to test a narrative in front of us, a narrative that is being experienced and which represents an argument for something to be decided ahead. 

> *"While there is work to be done on the problem, I think the logic of good reasons is the most viable scheme presently available by which narratives can be tested. Its application requires an examination of reasoning and an inspection of facts, values, self and society."* (Fisher, 1989, p.76)

<!-- The following idea, a possible objection for scientific of tecnical, is also covered in a further paragraph. Avoid duplicated ideas please so we might use the following to focus on the "testing" --> 

In other words, quick decisions happen, in highly skilled, technical or scientific teams, as we are all equipped with detecting the general coherence of a narrative, and supporters of a test system. The implication from the reflections of Walter is that we the audience affect the narrative the minute we are expose to it. We respond to narratives by diving with a narrative rationality. A super efficient model that gives superpowers to teams and again, it's like an interface so good that we can't see its action, it is transparent. 

## Outcome-based storytelling

In this direction, starting with the obvious, we need to acknowledge that focusing on goals is a great feature of humans. Therefore, having a goal, such as good objective, in sight is a requirement that help us find our way to get solve the problem. It brings motivation to what is at stake. After stating a goal, then we generally come up with what prevent us to get to that and we need a tool. This is where it comes in the language that appeals to action and an outcome. Therefore one can easily access that the call to actions we come up are not an enemy of productivity and it pulls the team to move. 

What is complicated is not that outcomes are stated with narratives with a language of conquer in it themselves, even though many of outcomes are likely crafted with that kind of language. But when it is not, in the face of the setting that seem to be quite scientific of formal, a language of conquer rises after the fact that the messages, the narratives of the day, are carried with intentions and aims improve the performance of teams for achieving future goals. In other words, it can't be detached, initially, that a language similar to political discourse appears in the face of the need to justify effort, such as more or less effort, in the face of a future and outstanding goal that needs approval of efforts, resources, commitment, etc. The messages works for the outcomes and start by augumenting a narrative that asks for improved performance. The rise of subjectiveness appears in narratives not as vagueness but as values, certainly the values that makes sense in the setting and for the audience. In other words, a super-effective narrative-based reasoning mechanism.  

> *"The criteria for assessing, say, a scientific text, will differ from those one would use in assessing a popular film, but the principles of coherence and fidelity apply no less to a scientific treatise than to a filmic communication. Furthermore, as I have said before, even technical discourse is imbued with myth, metaphor, and strategy or design."* (Fisher, 1989, p. 143)

Another aspect that shapes the design and evaluation of a given narrative, such as a messahe that appeals to the language of war and conquest, is a mechanism of comparison which was also brought by the Basecamp folks. Thus the narrative that is experienced, and evaluated, is more or less applicable when compared with other narratives used in other real action situations which the audience recognises. 

> "Lots of companies are driven by comparisons in general. Not just wether they're first, second or third in their industry, but how they stack up feature for feature with their closest competitors. " David and Jason, (2018, P.22)

Comparison is in us to help us decide with less analysis, quickly. According to Michael Dearing, "these are things you have instinctively in you as a human being, who makes discriminating choices between one thing and another thing that might be better." (Dearing, M. (2013, July 16))

Connecting the dots, we can move forward to account that, for the situations that we have things to compare, we are actually in fact capable of doing, a reasonably good job, of comparing. We do that quite fast as opposed to doing analysis which takes time. But the complication, especially for founders, is that we have lots of things to "shop and compare," thus we need narratives to help us, we seek what influences us. Therefore, the things like methods, tools, systems, principles, approaches for decisions, you name it, are promoted by narratives, or stories, that projects where and when they were used. Of course, the who tells counts too. 

If we are to think that all solutions for entrepreneurs are available in the big supermarket of entrepreneurship - and now these are mega supermarkets that are connected - we can visualize other structures such as the fact that every single product has it's narrrative in its label. And as we tour, we might find one or other representative of the solutions giving a taste of the sample. Another structural element is that the supermarket which became big has now aisles and its well oganized. Thus a whole section is dedicated to solutions within the domain of "This is good if you want to dominate the market", among others. 

The analogy of the supermarket does justice to the complication not because founders necessary go out to do a shopping seeking for solutions of-the-shelf as in pre-planned, as in to get tools and resources, at once, for a big recipe to happen such as a business plan where a team would deal with arrangement of things make sense later. But because in the modern and iterative approach for entrepreneurs, we are visiting the asiles of this supermarket all the time, 24x7, listening to advice from others, the ones we have created too, with storytelling present when we deal with all of these things. The complication for founders is not unlike the condition of a hungry customer that happens to be in the supermarket in a hurry, that happens to be in a place and a give time with a latent need. THe visit of as aisle is already an anchor we create and give us good reasons. After that, we compare and decide quick. Not unlike the shopper situation, our first reaction in the process of evaluation is to check the storytelling, if it has certain attributes, such as if it is valid, if it makes sense. Depending of what we get, it might provoke us to decide such as comparisons as opposed to all the time engaging in a complex analysis process. What puts in even in a more complicated place is that what used to be a long and complex process, such as a business plan, is now a long list of small processes, and all of them bring their own storytelling and very good reasons to be used. 

It is not diffult, for new entrepreurs, to jump to make a startup and come out from the supermarket of entrepreneurship with a lot of "solutions" in the cart, a lot of ideas, a lot of advices, methods, you name it. But it is also not difficult for this shopper to find later that the recipe didn't work as expected. In other words, the insertions of new narratives in the face of pressure, promotes a new storied context. 

A pause for a reflective moment about our decisions when we are pressured, such as hungry. I went to have lunch with my companion. The place is what we have in Brazil that is called live pasta - the cook, behind a glass, holds a hot pan and there are many ingredients so you can make your own pasta. I was the next so I had the chance to see her ordering first. It is important to note that I have Italian origins so a bit of a tendency to pick something more plain. If I was to order my pasta, and pick ingredients out of the 24 compartments, I would probably make a script such as: pasta, olive oil, olive oil, olive oil, garlic, garlic, garlic, manjerona, majerona, salt, salt, and bacon, bacon, and bacon. But I am guessing that she didn't have a recipe she was craving and out of the sudden the cook used the spoon to point to the first box and said butter? And was in front of a yes or not and said yes. Then bacon? She said yes. And after a while I could only hear her yes or no depending on what he was prompting. She end up with a brownisn colored plate with many things in it except the things she didn't like. So in a way, it seemed to be a false-positive. It passed, moved well, within the zoomed in narratives, but it wouldn't pass the italian test. 

Going back to entrepreneurs, and seeking a colorful example, consider the very situation when founders need to make a decision in front of a situation and findthemselves doing quick decisions based on the storytelling as opposed to a full analysis. Many entrepreneurs might simply gravitate towards deciding the quick route after the fact that they associate analysis with analysis paralysis [^analysisparalysis]. For the ones that read and taken a lesson about that notion, or story, consider the fear that they have as they might have heard of read about that and the risks of doing analysis. In other words, what if we once time heard about the condition of analysis paralysis as that advice were told in the right time and right moment and right context.
