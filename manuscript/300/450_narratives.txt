# The Narrative Dilemma 

In this chapter, we will look at impact o f storytelling in the entrepreneurial setting. In other words, we are interested in checking when storytelling eats strategy for breakfast[^footnote_andygrove_peterdrucker]. The storytelling aspect, ahead of us, has less to do with communications as generally seen, as the art and science involved when we create and use communication materials such as presentations. Instead, we will focus on the narratives of the everyday - that we experience and tell - that make us move forward. In this context, consider a provocation: Assuming that entrepreneurs are storytellers, are they consciouly using, or are they being used by storytelling?

What is really the complication? We generally know that storytelling is present in the everyday. We know that some people can persuade better or that the masters of good narratives can influence collaboration. But ... 

[^footnote_andygrove_peterdrucker]: Andy Grove quoted Peter Drucker's famous quote that "culture eats strategy for breakfast" in the book High Output Management. 

Let us contextualize the kind of the narratives of the corporate setting via appreciating a concern given by the founders of Basecamp, Jason and David. In their book *It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work* (2018), they call our attention to a kind of language that the business world is obsessed with, which for them is "a paradigm which does not make sense." They call our attention to action-oriented narratives that invite us to act. These can be identified in messages such as "Let's double the market?", "Who is getting which awards?", "Who is raising money?", and so on. 

> *"Sadly, it's not easy to escape the business tropes of war and conquest. Every media outlet has a template for describing rival companies as warring factions. Sex sells, wars sell, and business battles serve as financial-page porn."*
>
> (2018, P.21)

The statement from Basecamp worked for me as a great motivation to seek answers and it might be an opening to an investigation, or a reflection about narratives in the work day. Starting with the fact that what we get from the media, or what is caught by the limelight, is what sells more; as opposed to the boring language of the real work or what looks at the failures of the day. Another element is their association with the idea of conquest. Indeed, the visceral messages we find elsewhere seems to motivate us to an action as these messages promisses results. In other words, narratives are appealling and prompt us to action as it gives us the idea of the prize for when action is taken. Another factor, which might be less strict although quite influential, is that a "let's double the market" appeals to good intentions, that might call for a energetic move which may, in the end, moves the neddle even a little bit. Another element is also an implied comparison or analogy checking mechanism - consider that we our likeness to ignore a "let's multiply the market by 3.1415" goes along with the fact that we don't know any superstar team that has suceeeded with that rule. In other words, the "let us double the market" generally comes with a supporting line "like the Uber of X did it." These elements together are key so that we can find ourselves paying attention, enjoying, and engaging with the matter, the action that is being called. 

> *Cartoon strip. Strip one: A lot of heads are listening, a presentation in front of them, the chart shows the way up and a saying - let us double the market. Strip two one hand is raised and asks "Why double and not triple?". The third strip the speaker replies "Because The Uber of Dog Walking has doubled it. Strip four: yeah and plus is a lot of less work. Lots of others say good good. Deal. "* Marcio Galli cartoon as text. 

The complication - for entrepreneurs - is that as much as it seems absurd after we look in restrospect, we continue to decide based on narratives of the day that when experienced and told seem to fit perspectly and seem like rational arguments, it aligns with our needs in terms of urgency, it boosts us towards our goals. 

But these narratives of the average day sums up and builds a storied context that pushes us to difficult places. We not only act based on daily narratives, thinking that it serves a rational plan, but when we look back, we miss how influential these narratives were in terms of building up our decision making process and influencing the team's culture. In other words, how we deal with narratives is generally not considered, or accounted. Or more precisely,  the consideration if we reason and act on the basis of narratives is not given the right amount of attention. The best we generally do is to later seem to reconsider what happens in terms of culture. In other words, these narratives full of good intentions are likely taken as style of the narrator or the character. As if we check the "letters" that we exchange and see that it comes with color, with energy, emphasis, and emotions. We take these traits as good things that some of the us can do, that it convinces, it motivates, like a grease in the engine that we depend on it. 

That language of war and conquest, or as David and Jason referred as "a paradigm which does not make sense," set us in the right place to reflect if there is something more, especially in the setting of entrepreneurship, that accounts narratives as part of how we reason and act. My hope is that if we reflect about our natural way we engage with storytelling, we can improve our awareness that our decisions are made based on the not so logical and highly subjective narratives, which should put us in a humble, and smarter, position of improved responsibility for what we experience and tell, therefore more open, or reflective, about the influence of storytelling and any language that comes our way in the face of urgency. 

With that, we will first look at the narrative paradigm, the work from Walter Fisher's book entitled Human Communication as Narration, that explores the nature of reason and rationality in our communicative experiences. In other words, how do people come to believe and to act; which should give us insights to reflect if narratives are influential in entrepreneur's decision making. After an introduction to Walter's Narrative Paradigm and how the narrative rationality works, we will look again about our inclination to use that language of action as a potential inclination that helps the urgent needs when entrepreneurs are running the startup situation, such as when we are after outcomes. And finally, we will reflect about how the narrative paragidigm might affect lean processes.

## A not-so-rational-world paradigm 

<!--

Fisher, W. (1989). Human communication as narration. University of South Carolina Press.

--> 

In the context of entrepreneurship, in the end of the day, communication is available to serve the needs of humans as rational beings. Meaning that communication supports decision-making and is argumentative. The view accounts that communication serves the team's rational purpose of entrepreneurship - a familiar paradigm of the west, the rational-world paradigm. 

Such view supports the idea that storytelling, especially in the context of entrepreneurs, exist to convince an audience about ideas that need attention and where a decision is likely to happen. For example, presentations are given to teams or others such as customers or investors. Imagine a founder that does a presentation, such as an elevator pitch[^elevatorpitch], to an investor. She works hard in her presentation doing its best to organize the problem she has - the reason for receiving support - with an idea that the presentation shall help with persuasion, with clarity, with supporting data given as key elements and where if not present the result could end up as the audience not getting and then less able to judge and accept which might mean a denial. In other words, if storytelling as a tool where then quality matters and can affect how one understands the truths behind. 

[^elevatorpitch]:

But as indicated, the storytelling that we are concerned with are the narratives of the day, such as what is being exchanged to colleagues or any audience that supports the forward movement. In this setting, the rational-world view, or paradigm, also supports the idea that our daily messages, although might appear more or less persuasive, are carriers of arguments that serves to a rational logic behind. Similar to presentations, messages can be good or bad and then might help the audience to see more clearly the truths.  

This idea is quite strong and might support us to consider the reality being exposed by the narrative and not account that the narrative is an interface, that it influences how we experience what is being exposed, that influences our reasoning. The irony, and sad reality, is that a good narrative goes along with our our reasoning on that narrative and it does such as good job that we miss entirely noticing our narrative-based reasoning that happens, just like when an user experience designer claims that the best user experience is not visible and allows for the user to access the solution.

> Cartoon strips. Strip one, sir I have a message for you, they are coming our way. Strip two: King replies: Should I kill you then?. Strip three: Well, if they are coming for war, I could, for example, later inform you about their weapons. Strip three: King shoots and says "Send another messenger to check on their weapons." Marcio's cartoon.  

The good news is that this is such an efficient mechanism. When a good storyteller crafts a narrative for the sake of convincing the team about something, and gives everyone good reasons for so, the team jumps straight to the visualize the matter such as the concretes of an argument. They feel indeed a "good job of pulling these things out so that we are able to see," and indeed they sense these where elements of narrative that enabled them to see the reality. 

The bad news, and the catch, is that we miss the storytelling acting in realtime, and how the presence - or the lack - of those good reasons would have influenced that decision. If we assume that any narrative is essentially serving a rational logic, as in to persuade or convince or that it carries rational arguments, we are then looking at such this other aspect and likely in a place to dismiss a rationality system that depends on the narrative itself. With that, things are either accepted or denied in general. And when accepted, or denied, the team assumes it is logical and moves on to the next step.

In other words, while entrepreneurs advance with what they think as logic arguments, practitioners or mentors or anyone at a distanced view, such as an analysis in retrospect, might recognize a prior movement of following instincts or any other behavior such as that brings them into the condition of "we sort of sensed something wrong about that but we didn't see." As rational-world view puts the limelight in the concretes of the process - such as possible interpretation of methods, good and bad behaviors in terms of applicability, bad data, inability to detect signal from noise, these sort of things - the matter of considering the power of narratives is generally falls as secondary and less important considerations, although the notions of bad communication or toxic communication or some aspects of communication associated with culture are noticed. 

The contrasting view, the narrative paradigm, accomodates the idea that rationality fails to be present in the everyday argument, although still make us move forward with decisions. Consider the metaphor used by Walter, of the Homo narrans ("storytelling human") as beings that coordinates meaningful communication via storytelling and where they participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. The reason, my own good reasons here that I am thankful for the work of Walter Fisher, is because it helps me to reflect about how entrepreneurs engage in deciding with quick decisions - which might explain instinctive decisions - in the lifecycle of a team. Consider the advice that Paul Graham has offered to founders that joined the Y Combinator accelerator program: 

> *"The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least pause before making them. When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore. It's really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes they're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come back a year later and say 'I wish we'd listened.'"*
> 
> (Graham, 2014)

What there is more of Paul Graham which can be another hint for how we engage with our instincts: 

> *"You can, however, trust your instincts about people. And in fact one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to do that enough. They get involved with people who seem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings personally. Later when things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."*
> 
> (Graham, 2014)

The line of reflection from the experience indicated, where startups tend to follow instincts, results in lots of trouble which would be prevented if they could, for example, see from above or, as indicated by Paul Graham, getting advice from a certain special body of knowledge, such as advice from top accelerator program. On the people front, not in contradiction, when a startup is not complying with the long-run follow-through with people, such as stumbling on people that seem impressive, again, trouble might find their way. 

So I would summarize a bit of the situation in the introduction of this article and the situation of advice for founders starting the YCombinator program. The situation of the language of war, or conquest, is pointed the Basecamp folks as a language that is present in the corporate environment. On the other hand, Paul Graham confirms the founders following instincts. These elements, although don't explain the rationality in communication, after what make people believe and act after what they experience and tell, put us in the position to ask the question: what is the actual rationality being used? And what is it that seems to rational in the on the go, so technical as things are done. But then, looking in retrospect, are recognized as so subjective. And why is it puzzles experienced entrepreneurs and managers of entrepreneurship, such as Paul Graham, David and Jason, not only into reflections but to assert what seems to be a phenomenon whiich is present even among quite prestigious situations of teams, even in groups where smart people are part of teams? 

* Check - Or as a mechanism, or opportunity, where we exercise the variability in the face of pressure and with that influences our decisions. In other words, we fail to see that storytelling accomodates subjectiveness that gives us a chance, or an excuse, to advance. 

### Narrative rationality 

* For Walter Fisher, coherence and fidelity are logical principles. P. 138.

The views of professor Walter accomodates how teams are driven by storytelling in the first place. We should have an opportunity to reflect about the rationality that entrepreneurs use to deal with the various kinds of messages that pushes the average day of entrpreneurial action. We will see how the narrative paradigm, and especially its narrative rationality, applies so well to explain decision making in the setting of entrepreneurs, a setting that is goal-oriented, solutions-based, and where forwardness is a must. 

What is not visible about narratives comes from the ironical fact that storytelling works so well that we miss the insight that our ability to fall, such as follow instincts, is connected with how we live by storytelling. That is not to imply that we love to use good stories to justify our actions with no regard to rationality based in logic. The problem, and opportunity for reflection, is that the narrative paradigm has a rationality, referred as narrative rationality, which has logical principles (can we say that?) that supports our tendencies to decide. 

> *"The narrative paradigm proposes that human beings are inherently storytellers who have a natural capacity to recognize the coherence and fidelity of stories they tell and experience."* (Fisher, 1989, p. 24).


These two examples and the audience that Paul Graham was speaking to, young founders that joined the YCombinator acceleration program, can put us in the right spot to consider the notion of narrative rationality which explains how narratives are pervasive in the pace of quick decision making context of a startup. What seems to be about following instincts might be more like operating following a value system and trusting some ideas as they are coherent and seem to be valid and to work. Similarly, when we engage with people, such as listening to their impressive inputs, we are assessing and deciding highly listening to who said, the analysis of character, and what was said, if it sounds coherent, and further checks based on value, which may or may not involve more rational analysis and logic. A lot that goes on in the average day, especially among technical teams, is not double checked really. Messages just seem to make sense depending on who said and what was said. It supports moving on. 

For Walter FIsher, narrative rationality is not arbitraty, it has logical principles, and it is structured how we do that. So we should, for the sake of having a structure to this reflective moment, assume that a message is evaluated/assessed based on Narrative coherence and Narrative fidelity. In general coherence is a less analytical aspect (check this) where 3 main elements are used: 

* Argumentative or structural coherence 
* Material coherence 
* Characterological coherence - This is key difference with traditional logic, according to Walter Fisher. 

[P. 62, 64]

The advice from Paul Graham, applicable for considering, and reasoning, in the face of these instinctive movements, might as well support the idea that the domain of a startup actually advances on basis of storytelling as opposed to on the basis of rationality. When he states that "YC partners warn founders about mistakes they're about to make," he implies that advice from a great accelerator program, sort of Y Combinator, is applicable to save them from their poor judgements, instintictive moments. Similarly, when he confirms that founders engage with listening impressive people, it also implies that the value they perceive gives them reasons to move on, to decide. Therefore, it comes from that that how teams perceive advice matters, aside from the fact that the quality of advice matters, and aside from the cognitive function that can reach out to further truths to check quality. In addition, his view is an evidence that YC advice does not show a recipe for escaping instincts, such as one that is fully logical and non-network dependent, such as one that is based on analysis. In addition, notice that a lot of founders that gets into top accelerator programs, like Y Combinators, are in fact great as technical founders, that they are recognized as highly talented and technical cofounders, not counting the network of Y Combinator which is recognized as a key differential in the lifecycle of a startup and shows a highly level of cognition for analysis or for what is rational. 

### The logic of good reasons  

For the sake of structuring the situation communication of entrepreneurs - the environment where they experience listening and where they tell - we can establish that some kind of analysis in retropect happens somewhere in the future, in the face of their objectives. Paul Graham's exhibition of "I wish we'd listened" shows a pattern of a later judgement that appears when more validation comes their way. This idea also goes along with the expected idea of growth which ties with a measurement evaluation of growth. 

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth."* 
> (Graham, 2012)

<!-- 
Graham, P. (2012, September). Startup = Growth. Retrieved August 29, 2023, from http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html
--> 

Another aspect to be noted is the implied notion that for every single thing that they didn't listened seems to correlate with something else that they have listed, which goes along with the following of instints. Another factor in the setting is that decision making happens on the basis of active listening - from sources from their networks - such as from people sources, sources where impression is likely a function. Now, it should be accounted, or reccounted here, that the world of modern startup is dynamic and that founders are navigating, either directly or indirectly, in a digital world as they execute their process. In other words, the pace of interactivity and the iterative nature of modern startup development brought founders to navigate with through shorter projects and consequently more decision making that happens in realtime with what happens. That, as opposed to a more reflective situation of a team that puts their heads down to write a full 250-page business plan likely involved in longer analysis and a focused effort before showing results. In addition to any networks informing them, we should also account that teams are now moving, advancing, with the support of lean movements that promotes lots of interaction on their way.

Plus it should be accounted that the availability of data is also likely present and cheap to access. That data, or what appears to be data, that is easily acessible and might support startup needs as needs happens on their way. In other words, it is easier now to get advice online, free advice. It easier to match advice with methods and then advice plus methods plus data. It is easier to search for "a solution" just like a person with a condition might engage with searches as opposed to consulting a doctor. Althought it might seem odd that a smart team working in a startup to be compared with an average person that is suffering, or vulnerable, and engages in naively trusting web results; the perspective provided by Walter does not exclude smart people from the situation and in fact accomodates well how experts are likely able to fall, such as trusting instincs, as they are equally equipped with what will soon cover as the logic of good reasons. 

And it should be noted the obvious, that all of this is good and meant to accelerate, and which goes without saying that the quality of the process depends on judgment, in the end of the day. But let's keep a possibility, that a full rational verification such as one that oversees what goes on, might not find its place in the heat of the decisions. 

Now, the engine of the informed narrative rationality depends on what Walter referred as the logic of good reasons. Thus the assessment of coherence estalibles an inclination for the checking of the aspect of fidelity of the message. This second check is test humans naturally do, in terms of "whether or not the stories they experience ring true with the stories they know to be true in their lives. " (Fisher, 1989, p. xxx).  

In other words, our logic for adhering to the advice depends on warrants. Good reasons are these warrants. Walter have used the word warrant in the sense of what authorizes, sanctions, or justifies belief, attitude, or action. (Fisher, 1989, p.107). 

Now, the exercise, reflective, about how we seek for fidelity, according to Walter there is a 5 fold component for the logic of good reasons: fact, relevance, consequence, consistency, and transcendent issue. 

* Fact - are there implicit and explicit values in the message? 

* Relevance - "are the values appropriate to the nature of the decision that the message bears upon" p. 109 this also involves checking if values are omitted, distorted, or misrepresented. 

* Consequence - "What would be the effects of adhering to the values?" [Adds "for one s concept of oneself, for ones behavior, for one s relationships with others and society, and to the process of rhetorical transaction?" P 109

* Consistency - "Are the values confirmed or validated in one's personal experience, in the lives or statements of others whom one admires and respects, and in a conception of the best audience that one can conceive?" P. 109

* Transcendent issue - *Even if a prima-facie case exists or a burden of proof has been established, are the values the message offers those that, in the estimation of the critic, constitute the ideal basis for human conduct? " p. 109

As it is noticeable, these criteria for assessing good reasons, a logic, accepts higher degrees of subjectivity which unveils that a logic of asssessing good reasons to be dependent on values. This part of Walter's logic might suggest to us that if people use a logic of good reasons that embraces values in its logic, such as highly subjective values, then the consequence would perhaps involve the absurdity that humans adhere to things being experienced and told by listening to signals that appeals to some higher order values, such as even love, that pushes them to listen, trust, and agree/disagree, and decide. Yes, the narrative rationality accomodates that viewpoint, it's a highlight: 

> *"One can be fairly "objective" about what values are in fact present in a message, but as one moves to the questions of relevance, effects, confirmation, and ideals, greater and greater degrees of 'subjectivity' enter into the assessment. The intrusion of such 'subjectivity' is not a fault in a logic of good reasons. Instead, it is recognition of the very nature of human communication, and of the nature of subjects amenable to rhetorical expression. "* (Fisher, 1989, p. 110)

#### Notes about the team situation - the denial of values such as love 

* Check - p. 136 - the thing with love more than justice. 

Now, we shall also consider that the very basic mechanism of narrative in decision-oriented messages, that carries the logic of good reasons, is also used by any other participant in the team. Walter acknoledges that "The discourse that constitutes an interpreter's or critic's exploration of the values in messages will also inevitably express values. " (p.109)

In other words, and especifically in the collaborative setting, another factor of narratives has to do with how other participants chime in with their own logic of good reasons, in front of an outstanding message; with the intention to help the team to make a decision, a call, in the face of the clock that is ticking, so that others can chime in and the decision happens more effectively. 

[Consider here a cartoon of the founder that came from outside the building, and has asked the team to pivot. And the next strip the cofounders just say - No no, 72h rule, shut up and let us continue. Notice that cofounders might be adding "good reasons" from Steve Blank which might exercise implictly some of the good reasons attributes such as consistency, and even transcendent values.  ]

(Consider to add love) He goes on "I agree with Perelman's view on the necessity of recognizing and accepting pluralism. However, I would place love as the highest virtue or motivation I life, displacing justice from the pinnacle in the hierarchy of values. Love provides the ground of being and is the motive that should inform all others in human decision making in action. Perelman may well have agreed with this idea, and he could have then argued, rightly I think, that justice is a form of love, that civic love is way of honoring the dignity and worth of individuals and ensuring by rule their well-being in society. " P 137

( Consider the sitution of challenge with Arun. )

( "Finally, I believe that rhetoricians an obligation to inform students and to raise the consciousness of citizens about the nature and functions of values just as we have informed them about the nature and functions of reasons. " p.106 ) 

( Testable - "Reasons can appear in and through arguments, metaphors, myths, gestures, and other means of creating communicative relationships. In sum, to view communication through the perspective of narrativity, is to focus on message, on the individuated forms that constitute it, and in the reliability, trustworthiness, and desirability of what is said - evaluated by using the tests of narrative rationality." p.143 )

## Outcome-based storytelling   

<!--

Outcome-based works as good reasons. Anchors at various levels. 

* Shall we consider - the notions of efficiency / effectiveness against coherence and fidelity?

Chester Barnard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVi5iI6N8UM 

--> 

In this direction, starting with the obvious, we need to acknowledge that focusing on goals is a great feature of humans. Therefore, having a goal, such as good objective, in sight is a requirement that help us find our way to get solve the problem. It brings motivation to what is at stake. After stating a goal, then we generally come up with what prevent us to get to that and we need a tool. This is where it comes in the language that appeals to action and an outcome. Therefore one can easily access that the call to actions we come up are not an enemy of productivity and it pulls the team to move. 

What is complicated is not that outcomes are stated with clear narratives with a language of conquer in it themselves, even though many of these outcomes are. But even when it is not, in the face of the setting that seem to be quite scientific of formal, a language that conquer naturally rises after the fact that the messages, the narratives of the day, are carried with intentions and aims improve the performance of teams for achieving future goals. In other words, it cant be detached, initially, that a language of political discourse appears in the face of the need to justify effort, such as more or less effort, in the fact of a future goal that needs approval of efforts, resources, commitment, etc. The messages from the outcomes start to augument a narrative that asks for improved performance. The rise of subjective narratives finds its way even in the very scientific setting. 

> *"The criteria for assessing, say, a scientific text, will differ from those one would use in assessing a popular film, but the principles of coherence and fidelity apply no less to a scientific treatise than to a filmic communication. Furthermore, as I have said before, even technical discourse is imbued with myth, metaphor, and strategy or design."* (Fisher, 1989, p. 143)

Another aspect that shapes the design and evaluation of a given narrative, such as a messgae that appeals to the language of war and conquest, is the mechanism of comparison which was also brought by the Basecamp folks. Thus the narrative that is experienced, and evaluated, is more or less applicable in comparison to the narratives used in other real action situations. 

> "Lots of companies are driven by comparisons in general. Not just wether they're first, second or third in their industry, but how they stack up feature for feature with their closest competitors. " David and Jason, (2018, P.22)

Comparison is in us to help us decide with less analysis, quickly. According to Michael Dearing, "these are things you have instinctively in you as a human being, who makes discriminating choices between one thing and another thing that might be better." (Dearing, M. (2013, July 16))

Connecting the dots, we can conclude that for the situations that we have things to compare, we can do a reasonably good job, of comparing. We do that quite fast as opposed to doing analysis which takes time. But the complication, especially for founders, is that we have lots of things to shop - be that advice, methods, systems, principles, you name it - as we seek out activities that advance the roadmap of our startups. [Consider this one following to bring that connection of action with possible expecting outcomes, such as ones in a hierarchy, can support decisions and listening. L1: for the money, l2: win the market, l3: features. And the things inthe middle, methods. ] 

In the supermarket of entrepreneurship - and now these are mega supermarkets that are connected - we have too many products, or solutions, properly available in various aisles. When we go out, we find soutions that comes with labels such as "This is good if you want to dominate the market", among others. But there are too many aisles for all the sorts of needs. Things we can learn, things to help implement features, things sold as methodologies, advices, and so on. 

The analogy of the supermarket does justice to the complication not because founders necessary go out to do a shopping seeking for solutions of-the-shelf as in pre-planned, as in to get tools and resources, at once, for a big recipe to happen such as a business plan where a team would deal with arrangement of things make sense later. But because in the modern and iterative approach for entrepreneurs, we are visiting the asiles of this supermarket all the time, 24x7, listening to advice from others, the ones we have created too, with storytelling present when we deal with all of these things. The complication for founders is not unlike the condition of a hungry customer that happens to be in the supermarket in a hurry, that happens to be in a place and a give time with a latent need. THe visit of as aisle is already an anchor we create and give us good reasons. After that, we compare and decide quick. Not unlike the shopper situation, our first reaction in the process of evaluation is to check the storytelling, if it has certain attributes, such as if it is valid, if it makes sense. Depending of what we get, it might provoke us to decide such as comparisons as opposed to all the time engaging in a complex analysis process. What puts in even in a more complicated place is that what used to be a long and complex process, such as a business plan, is now a long list of small processes, and all of them bring their own storytelling and very good reasons to be used. 

It is not diffult, for new entrepreurs, to jump to make a startup and come out from the supermarket of entrepreneurship with a lot of "solutions" in the cart, a lot of ideas, a lot of advices, methods, you name it. But it is also not difficult for this shopper to find later that the recipe didn't work as expected. In other words, the insertions of new narratives in the face of pressure, promotes a new storied context. 

A pause for a reflective moment about our decisions when we are pressured, such as hungry. I went to have lunch with my companion. The place is what we have in Brazil that is called live pasta - the cook, behind a glass, holds a hot pan and there are many ingredients so you can make your own pasta. I was the next so I had the chance to see her ordering first. It is important to note that I have Italian origins so a bit of a tendency to pick something more plain. If I was to order my pasta, and pick ingredients out of the 24 compartments, I would probably make a script such as: pasta, olive oil, olive oil, olive oil, garlic, garlic, garlic, manjerona, majerona, salt, salt, and bacon, bacon, and bacon. But I am guessing that she didn't have a recipe she was craving and out of the sudden the cook used the spoon to point to the first box and said butter? And was in front of a yes or not and said yes. Then bacon? She said yes. And after a while I could only hear her yes or no depending on what he was prompting. She end up with a brownisn colored plate with many things in it except the things she didn't like. So in a way, it seemed to be a false-positive. It passed, moved well, within the zoomed in narratives, but it wouldn't pass the italian test. 

Going back to entrepreneurs, and seeking a colorful example, consider the very situation when founders need to make a decision in front of a situation and findthemselves doing quick decisions based on the storytelling as opposed to a full analysis. Many entrepreneurs might simply gravitate towards deciding the quick route after the fact that they associate analysis with analysis paralysis [^analysisparalysis].
