# The lean dilemma 

To recap, we may consider that what was given or experienced with that narrative rationality does less of a service to us if an idealistic attempt was to nail how people operate in a world that is actually considered to operate as a rational world where rationality prevails before narratives. What it may be a better use of the reflection, however, is the consideration that we use narratives to actually accelerate decisions - or how we use communicative experiences to reason and decide under conditions such as pressures of urgencies and to consider if anything like a narrative rationality is present and if it impacts the issues of the day, like the dynamics of processes that founders deal with, such as the lean methodologies. 

Now, we have considered in *Lean deficit disorder" that teams find challenging to execute lean, even when they do well, that they may lack a wider view of purpose. Therefore, we shall now set the stage to wonder whereas the narrative rationaly, taken as as an effective mechanism for collaboration, and its logic of good reasons influences the course of action of the lean movement.  

To move with this subject, we not only assume that lean movements are real in the path of entrepreneurs and that they use it to become productive, or rigorous, as they recognize that being efficient in the process of discovery is a must. With that, and as entrepreneurs engage, the assumption that they find complications where the promise - in the sense of enchantement - with lean seems to fall apart, perhaps not entirely but it may start to send signals and cause frustrations. In this situation, the consequences of concern may appear like when a team gives up lean, enters premature pivoting, and others conditions of when lean apparently fail, which also suggests that certain lean practices weren't really as appropriate, or are being executed incorrectly, if not leading to consider the possibility that lean does not work. 

But then it comes the complication, that entrepreneurs that execute lean run the risk of giving up lean, or to talk about using lean but aren't, or taking themselves into false-positives; or in other words generally failing with lean. This phenomenon is recognized by entrepreneurs and practitioners. This concern was reflected by Steve Blank, "doing lean vs. talking about lean" [^footnote_steve_blank_talking_about], that indicated that founders may suffer from an attention deficit disorder. The concern of Eric Ries can also be expressed by the question he asks entrepreneurs - "if you use lean why it is that you want to give up" [^footnote_eric_ries_startup_way_give_up]. Although these aspects are observations of the complication, we will consider how the storied context of lean applicability is impacted by the context as a major influence, how forces impacts phases such as hypothesis design, interview selection, data collection and interpretation, discussions and judgments for what is next.

Let's start by revisiting premisses of the environment of lean which may prepare the ground for a storied context, or so that narratives working for the cause of success could be applicable. Then we will look at how situations from lean movements that shows how the problem is experienced and real, then considerations for how the logic of good reasons affects the storied context of lean, and finally consider strategies for a healthier involvement with lean. 

## The stage 

Anyone navigating modern entrepreneurship is likely following the general philosophy, methodologies and frameworks of the lean movement. Consider Customer Discovery, of Steve Blank, which supports founders with interactions with potential customers and the goal to understand their needs and if they have a problem worth solving [^footnote_steve_blank_customer_discovery]. As we have considered in a prior chapter, the specific framework of Business Model Canvas is also a tool intented to learn about potential business models. These frameworks and methodologies are highly iterative and hypothesis-driven. 

[^footnote_steve_blank_customer_discovery]: 

In the context of startups, and aligning with the interpretation of Eric Ries [^footnote_eric_ries_startup] of a startup as a "human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty" (Ries, 2011; Ries, 2017), the Lean Startup methodology adds rigor to the complex process of innovation. One of its principles involves the cycles of learning, known as Build-Measure-Learn, as concretes in the sense of acceelerating [^footnote_eric_ries_accelerating] the feedback loop. Consider the principle [^editornote_principle_validated_learning] of validated learning: 

[^footnote_eric_ries_startup]: In the book The Startup Way, Eric discusses the complication when a startup - team that seeks to create a new product or service, under the condition of extreme uncertainty - does not protect the team from forces that prevent them to achieve clarity in the learning process that is key in the lean movement. 

[^footnote_eric_ries_accelerating]: Accelerating is not an appropriate term for any of the lean, although the value perceived by an amateur learner would lead to the belief that lean accelerates. Therefore, right at this point I make the very mistake of projecting a general idea of lean practices as intended to work for an outcome. While, in fact, these practices might be seen as means to dig, to improve reflectiveness, to aim learning where an actual window is openned into an interaction thus enabling a team to learn, to reflect, to propose a change and aim for more mature decisions. In other words, lean breaks into, more than jumps over. 

[^editornote_principle_validated_learning]: Is validated learning a principle? Name it a principle, or a value, it is part of essence in lean practices, as interactions with the external environment aims to capture value in the sense of information that supports growth which depends on appropriate investments that would otherwise be too risky. 

> *"The unit of progress for Lean Startups is validated learning - a rigorous method for demonstrating progress when one is embedded in the soil of extreme uncertainty. "* 
> Eric Ries, (Lean Startup, https://theleanstartup.com/principles)

Another pattern that can be identified with these methodologies and frameworks, such as Customer Discovery or Jobs To Be Done [^footnote_jobs_to_be_done], involves recognizing a closer interaction with potential customers as part of the learning cycle. For Tony Ulwick, the innovator behind the *'Jobs To Be Done'* (JTBD) framework, "while customers may not know what solutions they want, they most certainly know their needs related to getting a job done." (Ulwick, 2017)

## The movement 

We also know that the world has changed, that the longer process of analysis of a business plan does not work anymore [^stevenobusinessplansurvives], at least in the face of the popular lean movements that came to help team to innovate. Therefore, now, the pathway of entrepreneurs had changed from the prior world of writing a business plan to a new world, a highly iterative world, promoted by the lean movement. This new movement is meant to help teams to learn, from iterations, from experiments considerably cheap, from analysis of the experiments, trying to map value that suggests hints for more investment, the next stage.

But the complication, also recognized, is that teams give up lean, as they try to advance, which may lead to false-positives situation. The situation with lean carries the premise, that it is meant to learn, to iterate, and in the direction of being scientific. Lean is for that, a movement and has principles. But we also give up on that as soon as we stumble in what appears to be evidence. Renowned entrepreneur Eric Ries in his book The Startup Way [^ericriesonfoundersnolean] discusses a complication that comes in the way of founders as they advance with the lean startup methodology. He provoke founders pointing an intriguing trend that emerges when entrepreneurs often abandon the lean methodology once they find a promising lead. It's akin to an urgency mode kicking in, driving them to forego the principles that initially brought them to iterate and to learn. 

[^ericriesonfoundersnolean]:

In other words, just like we find "good reasons" to advance, or decide, within the boundaries of a smaller project, accounting its story, and then, storytelling comes from it and where a logic of good reasons is applicable to engage teams into switching gears. To note, the analysis of lean here is not a lean as a process but how storytelling impacts lean, the possibility. 

Where we are going, in terms of reflections on storytelling influencing these "shifts" starts via acknowledging that an outstanding message, like a narrative of an evaluation, appears at the end of certain "safe zones" such as the zone that supports the narrative, and in fact builds the storied context. In other words, a project may pull the team to find data, and find themselves into learning, as in to be not judged but nevertheless builds a storied context; which then cuminates in a the possible decision, in front of a next chapter in a narrative which makes an yet-to-be-assessed narrative that is outstanding in the face of such a next step. Then just like we have considered, in prior sections, we were able to experience storytelling in action in the face of the hour, the same effective mechanism of storytelling and narrative-based reasoning is suitable, and critical, in the face of the day or week or longer periods of time in such special moments when narratives are outstanding in front of decisions to what comes next. And what comes next? As indicated in this chapter, growth, which is recognized as an element that defines startups. [^paulgraham_growth]. 

[^paulgraham_growth]: 


<!-- 
Graham, P. (2012, September). Startup = Growth. Retrieved August 29, 2023, from http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html
--> 

Going back to the metaphor of the supermarket, it is as if we coordinate the construction of a story within the "safe zones" of advancement, a smaller project that feeds good reasons in the fact of an upcoming decision. And in that regard we seek, to that shopping for good reasons; but as we come to decisions, depeding on our decision and expectations, we move on visiting other isles of a higher-order, compelled again to buy-in and act in in the new zone which can be a investment of another nature such as associated with a bigger bet. Natural questions when walking this aisle are: At some point we gotta scale? Once we get product-market fit, and so on. As in, we move straight, or feel pulled to do so, into the aisle of serving the plates, to buy cups and plates for the party, without having properly done with the learnings if the recipe is good. 

As the move with lean, iterative, learn, in the process of execution towards their goals. And as they do, as expectations and goals are set, they seek out models to supports them to manage themselves, as resources, so that hopefully they move on to the next stage of investment. And, again, nothing wrong with that. Still, us bringing the storytelling and how we use it to this situation is key to put us in a more flexible position about the stories of what we read and write in the face of our intention to move on. 

Let's review the logic of good reasons being applicable by the founders as they work with fragmented data in the face of unceertainty of the lean process. Then the mechanism of the good reasons associated with the higher order pressure. And then how the storyline unfolds creating relative comparisons pushing a storyline. [Check these 3 titles.]

> "founder comes out of the building, asks to pivot. Silence equals to pivot. founder comes out if the building, asks to pivot, team claims the Steve 72h rule. Founder goes back to streets. " Cartoon strip interpretation of Steve notes, by Marcio 

But as we dive in the process, if we zoom in, we will see that the storytelling applied by the hour, as events are happening, as execution happens, is tied to the storytelling by the longer period of investment. To give colorful case, consider the "72h rule" created by Steve Blank to help teams to control the impulses of a CEO - that leaves the building to do interviews - that comes back with a story that seem to present good reasons to pivot. 

<!-- 

MAP14. (2014, March 13). MAP14 Public Forum: Steve Blank. [video]. Retrieved from https://youtu.be/UFx2CQUTpYo

--> 

The case presented by Steve shows how storytelling conveys partial data and compells the participants to act. It would be the case when the CEO presents its good reasons for a "let's pivot!" And as well, it is the case when the team stops that CEO with good reasons for "keeping your mouth shut, from when you think you got an insight do when you are allowed to announce the word pivot." (Steve Blank @ MAP14, 2014,  24m34s)

As an example, a CEO confronted with that strong saying, would perhaps have a lot of reasons to trust the team too, as like a good classical story, the indicated rule might have being said in the right time and space and might pull a truth in it. Thus, the rule does not lie is a result of its applicability in the context. It could be that it serves a purpose in the process but it may also influence the process. 

Thus, what is implicit in the doing of lean is a relationship with storytelling. We use storytelling to advance. At the macro level, such as when we seek higher outcomes - financial rewards - or at the micro level, in the daily routine, as we are oriented to outcomes that seem to be aligned with the further outcomes.  But, of course, there is nothing wrong with that, again. 

But it serves as an alert of our propensity to decide for action x or y using stories by the good job of providing it with coherence and fidelity - the proofs of value. And a reminder for us that, when the clock is ticking, sticking with a story that supports decision is generally applauded. We need to be pragmatic, in the end of the day, we need to move. And, again, there is nothing wrong with that. As the process, as we know it, will ultimately reveal the truth, in the end of the days. 

The case presented, when one says to use the "72h rule" is an example applicable to after the process of going out of the building. This the applicability of the rule, which happens to be used to prompt a decision, might be valid in the face of the longer process of the story. But, since the movement is forward, and scaling expectations is ahead, there seem to be expectations for certain indicators of "good reasons" that justifies the next movement of scale, such as the investment to develop a more complex prototype or sales experiment. 

In other words, teams are looking for evidence of value, such as values, which is driven by their very outcomes needs associated with their plans, if not they are also measured in terms of performance. 

## Logic of good and the lean audience 

Now, as suggested by the process, learning is involved so that the next phase of investment can be activated - either more funding, more resources, scaling needs, productization, and more. Implicit in this process is the idea that someone is observing, the judges, being the team or others supporting peers. 

Any learning effort that goes on, with a plan of execution (good or bad) will only happen in a period of time and should arrive at a presentation in front of a judgement moment with an audience, that will approve the next phase. The judges can be the founders approving themselves as resources to try again, do a new cycle, keep on going, you name it. Therefore, for the approaval phase to happen, a narrative has happened, a storied context was created, a story becomes outstand which takes everyone to a point where a given rationality deals with that narrative and affects the storied narrative, and next investments are made based on that. 

Now, zooming out from storytelling, and the fact that everyone is always doing their best in trying to defend themselves with good stories, we can shift our focus to the aspects of the tests, starting with the recognition that all that comes later are larger and more concrete tests, such as by real customers, by a significant share of a market. Conversely, the visceral reality is that representatives, or gatekeepers of what is next, are projected as the "eyes" to judge what is about to be proposed next, or ahead. In other words, they vouch, to accept or deny what is being done. As the goal in many startup situations is to scale, the goal is in the future, and in the future involves the representation of the voice of an audience, then value-based judgements chimes in, with partial data from the past/present associated with a coherent story (narrative, or argument) given by any participant and supported by an audience.  

<!-- 
Potential dup 
--> 

Still, our attention here, as we consider the process of lean, is that a lot of support that founders get has to do with the judgements that they do themselves, and by the others that they are contacting on their way, others which seem to be representatives of a wider audience. In addition, that they need to be organized and coordinate actions by telling themselves stories of how they are doing, how they are executing. The complication for them is that the actual storytelling of the execution will naturally deal with data that is more or less accurate. In other words, the methods they use, in the early stages and through discovery, are lean methods that naturally don't guarantees success at the next stop. If we consider tools such as the MVP, business model canvas, or customer discovery; all of these are iterative solutions to help them to get data, or fragments of data, that are to be interpreted subjectively based on founders knowledge, and becomes information inserted in their stories to support the call, such as a yes or no, for the next stage of investment. The very system of giving points, like score cards, based on these frameworks, don't give the answer, the ultimate answer. There are so many data points to be considered. IT's a value judgment view that approves the next phase of investment.

### Higher-order expectations and judgment calls 

Now, the existance of hierachies seem to make sense from the aspect of a higher-order system that holds the subordinates togethers in the face of uncertainty, such as volatility. The reason that the higher-order system does engage in risk analysis make sense, as they will approve the safety of its parts. This is perhaps not unlike the situation of a mother bird that has the household under her feathers. The chicks are experimenting, learning their ways, and she might ensure protection. When a dog approaches with barking, the chicks wouldn't be able to assess as they didn't see that situation before. The pattern of the crazy chicken is brought to earth, and dog goes away, and little chicks are still protected to continue their experiments. Some of them might learn from the pattern too, which is a bonus. 

Now, moving away from the cartoon of a farm, and straight into the jungle of large corporations, a point from Andy Grove, from High Output Managemet, organizes an ideas as the maturity level  [^foonote_andygrove_maturity] which involves the idea that trust is given by a higher-order that has higher responsability, to a lower-order subordinate, after proven experience, which translates as power to decide for decisions that may embody more complexity and even uncertainty. Now, in other words, the mother chicken could rest if she checks that one of the chicks is programmed to go crazy in the face of that looks like the energy, the barking dogs. 

[^foonote_andygrove_maturity]: 

Now the implication from a higher-order system is that it has rules - it approves movements of the subordinates. What we are now to consider, is that the entity of a higher-order, can be real or a model, a projection. What matters more is that it drives the team to move forward, and that is influences the decisions with a value system. 

But it is not that, in reality, such as the reality of a small team of 3 founders, the rules of a higher-order are strict, like a system-level implementation that will test the interactions, the data lifted by the teams. In reality, humans write the plans of what they expect, design all, and even go all the way to edit in real time the actual expectations for survival and for what is next. It's up to the team that call. 

Thus the more responsible teams have to be able to manage what they are doing with a transparency. In more complex scenarios, there appears representatives, such as members that signal the higher-order too, could be a projected narrative in the name of a department, a manager, and even roles representing the customer, a coach, a mentor, the legal department, human resources representative, you name it. 

#### Character values  

Consider the case of a designer that received a job of discovery that would be taken into account for a cause, an outstanding cause. Notice that the discoveries in these learning projects might actually impact teams - the subject here. The complication, to be considered, is that the isolated exercise leads to new data, that makes a call, prompts a new situation, an attempt to modify the storied context. Depending on the conclusion of the executor, a tension can be brought as alarming in the face of stability of the higher-order, such as the work situation of success for the parent team. This tension, creates a dissonnance, and may impact either the presentation or clearly invalidate the effort, or the other possiility is accepting that tension and figuring out how to resolve it. The point is, to put a colourful case, the manager may not like what the subordinate is about to discover. The manager might not accept one possible result, or certain direction. Or the very fact of a possibility of the subordinate being recognized as depending on the life of the manager, the identify of success associated with the state of stability, might itself influce the value system that affects the work of the subordinate and the judgement of the work.

#### Team character values 

A situation of the performance system impacting the execution was illustrated by Eric Ries in the The Startup Way, (2017, p.223). Eric Ries, when involved in the process of supporting a program of innovation at GE, FastWorks, came across the situation of moving forward, after prior validated learning effort. Eric was quite happy with the results and had in mind that the meeting would be about the decision to propose a new plan to the direction. To his surprise, mostly everyone denied moving forward. What he had discovered was that the change proposed, fundamented by the prior learning, would create additional costs for the company. Then Eric dug more asking help to find out the costs and they figured that it would be worth it to move forward. But still, another person brought up yet another good reason to not move forward, which was human resources: The fact that if an employee happen to rework in something, that would count against his career evaluation.

### Storied context in time and comparisons 

<!-- 
cross: links to part 2, 200/620_lean_no_lean.txt 
--> 

As we have seen in part two, there is a phenomenon [check this] of "doing lean versus talking about doing lean". As Steve Blank recognized the situation, it called founders to the truth that “one data point is not enough.” Now, viewpoint from external eyes might be able to see what founders - in the battlefield of lean - have trouble. The perspective from the protagonists, the ones doing it, turns to be different as value is found in realtime and the situations are assessed in contrast with the what happens in time. 

Consider, for example, when a team that never left the room, perhaps going out can be fascinating and too nice, or romantic. That maybe is simply the truth of the situation: Talking with someone can be fascinating in contrast with idealizing things in front of a digital screen. But again, nothing too wrong that. But it serves to illustrate that the appearance of a data point modifies the state of a story. The incidents on our way brings new "good reasons" in the face of the ticking clock; and pulls teams to moments of decisions such as changing a direction, even to prompt founders into a conflicting decision, or to look for a new mission. But again, what makes sense in the when-doing-it becomes easily more doubtable from external eyes. In other words, it is undeniable that a lot of these prompts that happens as the lean process unfolds happens to be quite arbitrary, our of what even seems arbitrary interactions, although with good intentions, with data such as from arbitrary customers with their arbitrary needs. 

The complication is tied to the expectations, such as measurement expectations, which naturally pulls the team to make decisions as opposed to keep trying and exercising the lean cycle again and again. The story that they need to succeed with lean becomes in itself another arc of a storytelling - as in outstanding - that influences their actions. Consider the question that Rohan Workman asked to Steve Blank, if he has seen when founders claim that they are doing lean versus talking about lean. Steve Blank acknowledged that as a disorder that affects founders when they get enamored with the process. 

Consider how strong it can be the data "from the real world" for a group of founders that were in a prior condition where they never left the room where they kept idealizing too much in theory, as hypothesis. Wouldn't be the case that, perhaps, their act of going out and "get the data" to become fascinating and inspire them to consider the external event as real data or good reasons? And, again, there is nothing wrong with that, of course, as talking with someone, a real customer, can be fascinating in contrast with idealizing things in front of a digital screen. So important and interesting that the very fact of contrasting with the prior situation, poorer situation, becomes a good reason perhaps for a new decision. 

#### Consider timeline in the face of goals and outcomes 

* Check p. 48 "Moreover, narrative rationality does not deny the limited but necessary use of technical logic in assessing inferences or implicative forms that occur in human communication. I would observe, however, that such assessments become useful only insofar as the discourse in considered as a whole, as part of a storied context in which other features of the discourse are taken into account, including mythic and metaphoric elements. " p. 48 

* Check - "Support for this view - that technical procedures and data should be interpreted in a storied context - is provided by Alexander Marshack. Numbering, he observes, "may perhaps be thought of as 'pure' and unrelated to storied meaning, but psychologically it is, nonetheless, a symbolizing and cognitive process. As such, it is always a 'time-factored' and 'time-factoring' sequential skill . . . " p.48 

* Check - There is another place, towards more the middle or end, perhaps, that Walter Fisher, brought the situation of time such as timeline. Or episodes. 

* Notice the 3rd level. Now consider when the prior situation, such as an incident, feeds the value formation from the lenses of comparison. 

* Notice that moving by analogy is also a value formation too, such as success where achieve via doing, and than it is likely that doing alike can do the same. A reference here, for models, is the the book it radical irrational, I think, some tio do vale has the link for the analogy being used effectively. 

* In the same like, analogy can also even make models, such as business models, to be applicable. Consider the phenomenon Uber of XYZ which provokes the reader in the frame that collaborative value of a sorts can be present. 

#### Check this thing about discrimination which can help with understand lean in the storied context

* 3 levels of what? Discriminations? 
* One will focus on the sequence of symbolic acfkons and their meaning. 
* one will recognize that no text is devoid of historical, situational, and biographical context,
* one will recognize that the meaning of value of any account are always influenced by how the account or story stands with or against other stories known to the audience of the other observer.

In alighment with a value I take from Walter Fisher, the narrative paradigm discussion helps with interpreting and assessing any kind of discourse. While it may seem as the week aspect, it can be the great aspect, especially for entrepreneurship. In other words, if things being told, and experienced, are influencing decisions, such as things that convinces people, why not to accept all the possible ways people to that, and be aware of these things that seem like tools or, as in many situations, seem to be like the traits of poeple that convinces which is not separated from their perceived status. In other words, we want to pause and reflect for anything that convince us to move forward. (p.86.)

Our goal, in alignment with what Walter wrote in p.88, is to support critical self-awareness and conscious choice. 

The challenge for founders lies in the knowing that truths are wanted, such as facts, that tell them about if they are in the right direction. Still, as we have seen, the process for advancing entrepreneurship uses storytelling as the most basic transactional mechanism - a mechanism of collaboration - that conveys meaning in the fact of the needs of the present and future. 

One way to help with the checking the sanity of storytelling is to test it against different viewpoints. Of course, a question remains as what is the viewpoint that matters. And this is a strategic conversation, or collaboration, that happens as stories are developed. 

The presence of venture capital in the path of a start-up offers an exercise for us to understand how analysis in perspective can provide opportunities. If a start-up is in a path to get investment, such as venture capital, it is likely assumed, on the one hand, that the start-up team is aware of the dynamics of that path, that might have a resonable knowledge of the type of partners that align with the start-up vision and mission. [Hard to assume that, right?] With that established, on the other hand, the dynamics with the venture partner likely involves a step ahead where judgment calls are made, likely involving a risk analysis. [^riskanalysisofvc]

[^riskanalysisofvc]: 

The supporting elements, to move on with new investments, becomes the stories we craft after our discoveries, and how others perceive our stories which may or may not involve data analysis, of course, as indicated by "risk analysis" the checking process is not totally done as data is incomplete. Even if the team works to adapt, or pass a criteria, the team does not know the criteria for initially passing and the qualitative reviews involved. [Other chapter refers to not game the system, as wasting time for selection. And other chapters we reflected about quantitative and qualitative later. ] This, it is reasonable to consider that the venture capital barrier has a viewpoint that founders might not have. An example, is that VC firm Sequoia Capital were in the seeking for what would disrupt cabs, such as yellow cabs. They also had insights about the challenges for that disruption to happen, such as that facing the fight with yellow cabs would be dfifficult. According to [Brad Scale up] Sequoia had an interaction with a good candidate that has refused to get out from the yellow cab situation, in the sense of being strategic to work with black cabs first. Uber end up receiving the support later. [Bring the data of that. ] In that story, it is sort of noted that one would not say no to a VC like Sequoia. But, on the other hand, the no meant that wxpectations for scaling with certain VC traits, like strategics, had more conformity with Sequoia-Uber relationship.  

To point another example of dynamics, consider how VCs look at founder reputation for the situations where VC does not have indications yet, or have provided limited data on potential, which is a lot of trhe case. In other words, venture capital "pipeline" confirms is that the early stage trust is tied with the reputation and credibility of founders. [^foundersreputation].

Consider how the community around founders is generally influential to help founders continue to move, or to try again, or continue to improve in the current line of development. The power dynamics is always present too and noticed when the CEO says something, when someone says that the data says something, that a mentor said something, the judges of an accelerator program, investors, potential customers, and so on. 

A case that is common is when an early customer is inclined to buy. This is quite powerful even when there is no product or what the customer wants is in fact not part of the goal. Many founders jump to getting that customer as it rings the bell that cash is coming in. That pulls effort for someone to try to put that into the story and can be quite powerful to promote a new direction if it fits as good reasons. 

From an accelerator perspective, conside the data that Brian Confirmed where the founders having done the cereal box project have influenced in part the approval for Y Combinator. [Bring data on that.]

These illustrations are here to help us to execute these processes, the episodes of a lean process, with more tolerance to the results and awareness. Since awareness is key to any process, and founders generally suffer from being enamored with the process, it becomes the founder’s responsibility first to recognize such syndrome; then second, to find for ways to ensure the process is running with quality. But them, wait, what is quality right? Is quality related to control? Consider Scott Belsky’s view about faiure from Making Ideas Happen:

> “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity. Stay strong and stay calm as a situation settles itself over time and the clouds around any period of change start to dissipate. “ (Scott Belsky, 2010, Making Ideas Happen)

This view perhaps support us towards the idea of the knowing that the process and our presence to tell stories, is likely affecting the whole proces. This notion, when embraced, can provoke founders to be in a more humble position which improves them into listening even more and to do the craft, such as to pull data and advance episodes, but to know that all their did had to do with their effort with limited data, as limited beings, influencing the story and the storytelling. As they say that, upfront, they keep a reminder to them, and to the audiences, and also open the door to get more data from external minds. The improvemet of quality derives from that listening condition and may improve when they engage with an advisory board as a body responsible for an outside perspective therefore supporting the founder to get out from instant pressures, and compromising decisions: 

> "That is why you need an advisory board, or board of directors, who is coaching the founders on this because you could get enamorated with the process and confused that the last person to blow on your ear, actually have a valid insight."  (Steve Blank @ MAP14, 2014, 24m51s)

Now the general indication of having an advisory board needs a reflection as it may make sense that there is an absurdity. That because a board of directors are, in general, known and applicable as necessary for large companies. Therefore, there is a general understanding that ignoring a board of directors is a good thing. 

But the reflection is key in establishing the idea of the "entity" of a board of directions, or the role of them. Consider the view For professor and investor Michael Dearing, for why founders need a governance approach: 

> "I need to make sure that somebody is looking at this who isn't just me. Who can critique the strategy it might be an advisor it might be a trusted colleague it might be a cofounder." Michael Dearing. (Greylock, 2015 October 8, 1:00:00) 

Now, we need to be sensible that an early team might not even be able to find a good external eyes to help them there. But the early founders should keep in mind that they need to construct their own system of support to save them from their bad narratives. Michal goes on to indicate that the key point is to seek to create a valuable function of a shock absorber that does the function of checking the progress of founders.

### Perspective of experience 

* Reid, within the context of what he calls "the theory of small gifts," has indicated that one person might be able to provide a perspective that produces great value for the other. https://youtu.be/kQJf7W88HDs?si=T22LZdFqPdXG_y-2&t=1996 https://mgalli-com-dev.medium.com/the-theory-of-small-gifts-fd8a15c1f45a


#### Consider: 

* Moving into lean, the consideration of message and carrier, the storytelling by a storyteller, and the system of values supporting by the accounting. This shall establish also a bridge to the modes to help with the innovation problem as pointed by Eric Ries, innovation accounting, for example. A link also can be give to Michael Dearing on Npv and the provocation from Reid Hoffman. 

Nevertheless the core of the reasoning here is that In the fact of outcomes need, that yields benefits, we fall for selecting stories like a salesman of the presented losing the sight if an enlighted salesman. 

(The following was written also above) 

We shall remember here the situation that Maslow have compared of the bad salesman and the enlighted salesman. The one with focus in the present doesn't care about reputation. 

Thus, under lean, we can wrap up the ideas of: 

Outcomes driving selection
Comparison of stories 
Stories in time

## Curating the devil's advocate, it's okay to destroy 

The founder engaging in the devil’s advocacy business
“[Reid Hoffman asks] And what are the indicators that you would use for checking the idea. [context: You could be jumping off a clicf without the ability to assemble the airplane on your way down]. What are the crosschecks you think people should do?

> "[Michael Dearing] One really good one is to give a chunk of time in the schedule to devil’s advocacy. And this was a tactic that I learned from Michael Eisner at Disney. I didn’t work for him but I worked for somebody who worked for him and the whole idea there was — every big good idea is going to be subjected to a devil’s advocate case. And somebody, probably the smartest person he could find, is going to be in charge of trying to destroy your idea. And he or she isn’t gonna be held as, like, they’re not going to be considered to be out of bounds for trying to destroy your idea it was their job to try to destroy your idea. And that technique of saying — okay, you please spend the next two days finding everything wrong with this, and then you have full permission to be the biggest asshole you ever met, trying to torpedo this idea. If you can find some people in your life who can play that role, that’s a huge positive as a founder. (Michael Dearing @ Greylock, 2015, 33min18sec)
