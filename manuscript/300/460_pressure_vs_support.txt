# The flow 

We often find ourselves under pressure, whether it's derived from internal or external factors. How we handle this pressure can be a decisive factor between victory and defeat. A recent lesson reveals that at times, wrongly applied pressure can steer us off the real path to achieve our goals.

On a maritime journey, a commander and his sailor sons face the challenge of maintaining their course and reaching their destination. The commander, impatient with the lack of progress, opts for an aggressive approach: he throws one of the sailor's luggage into the sea, hoping to ignite a reaction. However, despite his drastic action, the boat doesn't speed up.

In desperation, the commander decides to step back temporarily, leaving the sailors on their own. This forces the sailors to adapt and find new strategies to move the boat forward. They realize that the beauty of the boat, which until then was not being capitalized on, could be a great attraction. The sails are raised, displaying their beauty to anyone in sight, and soon the boat is moving again, this time at a much faster pace.

So, is pressure a futile tool when it comes to achieving our goals? Not necessarily. Pressure can be a powerful driving force, but it must be strategically applied and aimed at the right goal. Focusing too much on secondary issues can blind us to the true strategic action that needs to be taken.

The Role of Context and True Strategic Action

The first lesson drawn from this story is the importance of understanding the context. In the case of the boat, it was necessary for sailors and the commander to identify the mission of the context - what really mattered for the progress of the boat. This involved setting aside their own desires and focusing on what benefitted the boat as a whole. The true strategic action emerges when we recognize the objective of the context and identify the necessary actions to achieve it.

Identification of Key Results and Actions

The second pillar for successful navigation is identifying key results and corresponding actions. In this regard, a pressure system can be effective. When the sailors knew that their actions would have a direct and expected impact on the journey, they put in more effort. Pressure, in this case, served as a stimulus for the execution of strategic actions.

Evaluation and Observation

Lastly, it's not enough to just identify and carry out strategic actions; it's also necessary to evaluate their results. Not every well-intentioned strategy leads to positive results, and that's where evaluation comes in. The commander's story illustrates this truth. His initial strategy of throwing the luggage into the sea didn't have the expected result, but the consequence of this act - his temporary withdrawal - allowed for a new strategy to be formed.

Conclusion

In summary, pressure is a valuable tool when used correctly. It's essential to understand the context, identify key actions and results, and finally, evaluate and adjust strategies as needed. In the heat of the moment, it's easy to get carried away by urgency and forget about strategy. This lesson applies not just to sailors or commanders, but to all of us because those who act under pressure might end up prioritizing urgency over strategy, leading to significant losses. So, remember to take a step back, assess the situation, and act strategically.

## Effortlessly pushing for effort

Em um mundo onde o ritmo acelerado parece ser a única forma de se manter relevante, surge um problema que muitas vezes é ignorado: a cultura da urgência. Essa pressão constante, seja para cumprir prazos ou atender demandas, pode criar uma cultura de trabalho tóxica, onde o equilíbrio pessoal e a harmonia do time são frequentemente negligenciados.

Essa realidade é ainda mais agravada quando líderes, que em suas próprias carreiras vivenciaram essa pressão, passam a perpetuar esse padrão. Esse ciclo vicioso cria uma espécie de corrupção silenciosa - não de dinheiro, mas de tempo, energia e potencial humano. Os colaboradores são pressionados a gastar energia extra, a comprometer seu equilíbrio e a renunciar ao seu tempo de descanso e desenvolvimento pessoal.

Essa cultura da urgência e da pressão constante não apenas compromete a saúde mental e física dos colaboradores, mas também afeta a produtividade e a criatividade. Portanto, é necessário uma mudança fundamental na forma como o trabalho é visto e gerenciado. Aqui estão três pilares essenciais para essa mudança:

Tempo para Desenvolvimento Pessoal: As empresas devem valorizar e encorajar o desenvolvimento pessoal de seus colaboradores. Isso envolve permitir que tenham tempo durante o horário de trabalho para estudar, aprender e crescer.

Custo Real do Trabalho: Os líderes precisam ter uma visão clara e realista do custo do trabalho - um custo que inclui o impacto no bem-estar e na saúde mental dos colaboradores. Com essa compreensão, as decisões podem ser mais informadas e equilibradas.

Planejamento Transparente: Com uma visão mais realista do custo do trabalho, os colaboradores podem planejar melhor seu tempo e recursos. A falta de transparência no planejamento pode levar ao estresse e à ansiedade, prejudicando o desempenho e o bem-estar geral.

Ao priorizar esses três pilares, é possível criar um ambiente de trabalho onde a aceleração não seja a norma, mas sim a exceção. O verdadeiro sucesso vem quando conseguimos desacelerar, respeitando o tempo, a energia e o potencial de cada colaborador. Essa é a forma de combater a corrupção silenciosa e de construir um caminho para um sucesso mais sustentável e equilibrado.

## Team health  

<!-- team self esteem and the drive for innovation
-->

* conscious business - do you have the time?

* Maslow, p. 178 - Maslow points out potential problems when people with different levels of Intelligence (as measured by iq) are interacting. Such difference between people would create a tension in the collaborative environment, such as for the less smart to potentially engage in self-defense, to even get hostile. Yet such tension would be potentially minimized if consciousness is developed about the nature of the interaction. Because people would not misunderstand the others when they have conflicts. For maslow, there is a connection with self-esteem. This thought also supports the idea, mentioned somewhere else in this work, and presented by Andy Grove (Only the Paranoid Survive) that a great culture needs to acknowledge the role of fear and people should never be punished or feel fear regarding their ability to speak. Allowance for speaking, without the fear of being punished, is a key element at innovative companies and a essential trait for collaborating teams. Not fearing trouble is a team version of self steem. For Silicon Valley legend, Bill Draper, one essential attribute of venture investors is not fearing failure; an idea that is perhaps intrinsic of the field exactly because venture investing is a business of ups and downs, or as bill said "some lemons" (get fast clip of Bill).

* Regarding self-esteem, actually the concrete point from Maslow is that that people engage in defense mechanisms in order to safeguard their self-estreem. P.178

* Abe maslow, p.178 - for Maslow, a question of time and time span affects collaboration and management. The illustration is of an environment where quick decisions are needed. In this situation, the superior (in the case of maslow a player that is superior in Intelligence) have a tendency to make decisions quick, to be directive, authoritative and to not allow room for discussion. It's an urgent agenda with no time for redesigning, possibly allowing actions such as harvesting or applying the potential that is on the table. On the other hand, there could be a situation that more time is allowed, thus in this scenario the superior can act differently. In this case, Maslow considered the building of a business to last for 50-100 years. In such protected frame, the dynamics of the group could be different and tending to the participative front, even in the condition of a natural unbalance with superiority of manager amid subordinates. If the time range is higher, such as if we extrapolate to the point of the need for a manager to find its sucessor, then the authoritativeness approach may become different, such as it may have better chances to tend to the manager approach as pointed by Andy Grove, the manager as an educator for example.

* Maslow adds, p.178, "this is a little like saying again that the ideal management policies are best under good conditions in a good world for management of good people. " And "If we had a peaceful, one-world society in which there were none of the present emergencies and in which we could patiently work toward the improvement of mankind, then the more participative management would be more desirable, even under this special condition of admitted superiority. "

## Crying not okay vs. Screaming Fine 

* Trazer o caso da Melissa Nightgale, que se a empresa abusa da vida pessoal, quem é a empresa para não deixar a pessoa chorar no trabalho? E que isso é um tipo de assédio que "corta as pessoas". A Melissa fala tb sobre gritar pode mas chorar não. 

* Tinha algo tb que Marcio ouviu na conversa do Jow, sobre ele ter achado estranho a dona chorar.
