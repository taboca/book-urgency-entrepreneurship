## Barbara Minto Framework 

- To whom are you writing?  
    
    Entrepreneurs, managers of entrepreneurship. 

- What is the subject you are writing to him about?
    
    Danger of communication in the average day, how narrative can trick entrepreneur's execution. 

- Remind yourself what the reader already knows about the subject. n. e.g., what it is, how it works, how he has been exposed to it 
    
    They know it is a tool (what).
    They recognize as working for rationality (how).
    They think is to make presentations, pitches, memos (exposed to it. )

 - Determine why he needs to know anything more about it 

    Because they keep missing the important of the narratives of the day and how they decided based on 
    what they experience and tell, based on value system more than rational logic. 

- Write and remind him of what he already knows, what more it is he needs to know, and then
   communicate what he needs to know to him in your memo.

## Outline

* v0.2 - Storytelling for entrepreneurs is a tool and the narratives of the day are not too relevant. They judge what is being done and miss the how narratives are assessed, in the average day. How the sytem that enter influences daily narratives. More awareness is in order. For that, a) Narrative paradigm b) Outcome-based language c) Lean analysis. a.1) Rational vs. Narrative. a.2) Narrative rationality a.3) Logic of good reasons. d) Conclusion 

* v0.1 - Provocation, SCqA, Answer, reflective, being: Narrative Paradigm as a Transactional Mechanism Applicable to Urgency and Fast-paced nature of start-ups. Outcome based and anchors supporting narrative. Willingness to Drop Lean and Learninng. Conclusion and considerations for scaping, introducting next chapter.

## SCqA 

* v0.2 - Entrepreneurship depends on storytelling. What we experience and tell influences what we do, are the narratives that make us advance our journeys. As entrepreneurship deals with the future, present and past, entrepreneurship embraces narratives. As much as entrepreneurs think that storytelling is a tool and that they use to serve a rational model, entrepreneurs continue to execute their plans following the narratives they experience and tell themselves which is highly subjective and oriented to values more than rationality. As a complication, the observed effect is entrepreneurs facing failures as they didn't assess properly the narratives of the day. As in, they follow instincts, especially in the face of pressure and urgencies and within the framework of many startup frameworks and the startup culture. This article offers an opportunity for reflection about how humans reason and act on the basis of what they experience and tell. And especially, the narrative paradigm, will help us assess that language of narratives are so good to advance entrepreneurship that it can also mislead our actions. The awareness about the power of narrative is worth of our time. 

* v0.1 - We why we venerate winners and their stories? Why outcomes? When it comes to narratives, 
we venerate outcome-based narratives. Complication - When it comes to narratives, we venerate outcome-based narratives. Complication - How to move towards real outcomes but not get distracted by storytelling that gives us no results. 

## Style 

* 450_narratives.txt // Life and family - A touch of humor, or attempt to pull truths from the life, appears on our way. But not in an arbitrary way. The point, that life urgencies gets in the way. You think it doesn't? It comes back to culture, and language, such as the language of war, or action-oriented language. 

* 450_narratives.txt // #pasta #family The case of the Pasta and the urgency of the live pasta. The cook, by asking yes/no for all ingredients in a certain order, implies a value system. It suggests a narrative and guidance.

## Attempt to talk about theme, how we reason with narratives. 

* Lacks - why 
* Goal  - to improve, sort of ok 

Our focus in this section is an opportunity to look at how entrepreneurs reason and act on the basis of the narratives that they experience and tell, especially in the face of urgency. In particular, if we understand how entrepreneurs decide based on narratives, it helps them to execute plans of entrepreneurship with more responsibility. 

## Storytelling is a tool, serving rationality 

In a traditional way of thinking, storytelling is a tool that can be used to our advantage, such as when a founder gives a pitch to an investor with the intention of receiving support. Or, from the perspective of acquiring feedback, a team presents a story in order to ask for advice. Therefore, as a tool where narratives - experienced or told - are working for the strategy. In this way of thinking, we believe that stories serves a rational plan, that it serves strategy, and that we are generally in control.
