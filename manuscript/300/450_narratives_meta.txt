## SCqA 

* v0.2 - Entrepreneurship depends on storytelling. What we experience and tell influences what we do, are the narratives that make us advance our journeys. As entrepreneurship deals with the future, present and past, entrepreneurship embraces narratives. As much as entrepreneurs think that storytelling is a tool and that they use to serve a rational model, entrepreneurs continue to execute their plans following the narratives they experience and tell themselves which is highly subjective and oriented to values more than rationality. As a complication, the observed effect is entrepreneurs facing failures as they didn't assess properly the narratives of the day. As in, they follow instincts, especially in the face of pressure and urgencies and within the framework of many startup frameworks and the startup culture. This article offers an opportunity for reflection about how humans reason and act on the basis of what they experience and tell. And especially, the narrative paradigm, will help us assess that language of narratives are so good to advance entrepreneurship that it can also mislead our actions. The awareness about the power of narrative is worth of our time. 

* v0.1 - We why we venerate winners and their stories? Why outcomes? When it comes to narratives, 
we venerate outcome-based narratives. Complication - When it comes to narratives, we venerate outcome-based narratives. Complication - How to move towards real outcomes but not get distracted by storytelling that gives us no results. 

## Style 

* 450_narratives.txt // Life and family - A touch of humor, or attempt to pull truths from the life, appears on our way. But not in an arbitrary way. The point, that life urgencies gets in the way. You think it doesn't? It comes back to culture, and language, such as the language of war, or action-oriented language. 

* 450_narratives.txt // #pasta #family The case of the Pasta and the urgency of the live pasta. The cook, by asking yes/no for all ingredients in a certain order, implies a value system. It suggests a narrative and guidance.
