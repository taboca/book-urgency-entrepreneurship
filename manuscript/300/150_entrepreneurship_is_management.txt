# Not so radical focus

If entrepreneurial effort happens to creatively destroy the old and change anything, it does so not in theory or as a fiction - although theory and fiction goes along as - but under the terms of getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone]. Execution is, therefore, a necessity for change. As we do, and as much as we do not follow a very scientific approach, we are inclined to measure our progress, based on what we want to do, what we are doing, and how we are doing. With that, comes a complication: How to track our progress effectively when what we are doing requires innovation and walking through the path of uncertainty? How to do it in a way that the creative and aspirational component simultaneously supports the concretes? 

[^footnote_schumpeter_entrepreneur_gettingthingsdone]: Joseph Schumpeter, in Capitalism, socialism, and democracy, highlights the characterization of "getting things done" (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132) as an essencial element of the entrepreneurial function - even more than other elements such as entrepeneurial ability to invent new things or create the conditions for the entreprise to thrive.

> *"To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct economic function, first, because they lie outside routine tasks which everybody understands, and secondly, because the environment resists in many ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions with the enterprise exploit. It consists in getting things done."* (Schumpeter, 2008, p. 132)

As much as we have a lot of tools that promises to help track and find our way to innovate, is it not easy to have a clear view of what goes on and to see in perspective. We keep falling in traps also for the matter of managing productivity, even to a point of doubting the ways to manage progress.  

Eric Ries[^footnote_ericries_lean], the notable advocate for Lean principles, continually reminds entrepreneurs that learning is the essence. His words provoke reflection on how inclined we are to use lean methodologies more like a system to accelerate and execute, rather than a system to learn—essentially attempting to harvest something we didn't originally plant with proper care.

> “What I think is really interesting about these stories about entrepreneurship is that 95% of the time of the movie is spent in act one and act three even though in real life all of the important work of entrepreneurship happens during the photo montage.” (Ries, 2011, 4:58)

[^footnote_ericries_lean]: Eric Ries is a renowned entrepreneur and author, best known for pioneering the Lean Startup movement. His seminal work, "The Lean Startup," introduced a methodology that emphasizes the importance of adapting and adjusting business directions with agility, based on customer feedback. In his subsequent book, "The Startup Way," Ries expanded on these principles, providing a framework for entrepreneurial management applicable in various sectors, from fledgling startups to established enterprises. As a thought leader in the world of startups and innovation, Ries has played a pivotal role in reshaping the way companies are built and new products are launched.

Notice that “photo montage” that he seeks, the thing we as founders don't care, shows the gap. We gravitate for tracking success more than tracking learning. From the standpoint of narratives, we will have an opportunity to reflect about how we use storytelling such as to trap ourselves. But for now, our focus in this reflection faces the challenges of tracking goals especially when the team seeks to innovate. 

We will reflect if goal-setting and tracking makes sense when the space ahead is uncertain; When tracking disconnects from strategic thinking; And come up with principles for managing our investment. 

## Can goal-setting survive?  

In *It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work* by Fried and Hansson (2018, p. 32), the authors provoke readers with the article "Making it up as you go." They argue that adhering strictly to strong goals, such as setting 2, 3, or even 5-year plans, can be detrimental to genuine progress.

[Should we bring a block quote from them here?]

Althought they don't endorse the big and sticky goal plan, a slow refletion is a must. With "Make it up as you go" they are concerned that teams can sometimes put goals that works the other way around - that costs more time. But worse than that, it changes how teams perform as anxiety comes their way: 

> "Much corporate anxiety comes from the realization that the company has been doing the wrong thing, but it is too late to change the direction because of the 'Plan.'"
> 
> — Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33

In other words, they recognize that unexpected outcomes shows as teams advance towards something, like a goal, as they come across data that challenges what they were doing. Therefore, if following David and Jason viewpoint, we have to face the importance of creating the conditions for a healthy way of working. No anxiety on our way is key when it comes to understanding the discoveries that can likely help us to improve our roadmap, including the possibility of let go for a bad goal.

It seems reasonable to lock in a "Therefore" here. That we all seek to instill a healthy condition for the worker to evaluate what they are doing. Their call has more to do with that, as opposed to not having a plan at all.

But a pattern of planning is shown by them and put us in a good position to check, or ask, if a stronger goals, such as long-term goals, make sense and how to deal with that in the face of uncertainty: 

> "Every six weeks or so, we decide what we will be working on next. And that is the only plan we have. Anything further out is considered a 'maybe, we will see.'" (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 32).

<!--

--> 

Their "maybe, we will see" is an invitation for us to continue a reflective moment about goals such as long-term goals. If something is "maybe", it implies that something is exposed, or being discussed, or shared in the first place. And the "we will see" sets a principle which says something like "we will learn and decide." Therefore, there is a discussion going on. With that invitation, let's look at what others have documented, such as from theorists, practitioners, and entrepreneurs that claim that goals, and even long-term goals, matter. 

One of the resources to this reflection comes from a key book that has championed the idea of aligning and engaging teams around measurable goals. In the book entitled *Measure What Matters*, John Doerr [^footnote_johndoerr_okr] continued his saga to popularize a framework - known as OKR - that has helped him and his teams to innovate with goals.

[^footnote_johndoerr_okr]: John Doerr, a renowned venture capitalist, has been a vocal advocate for the framework of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) which he discusses in his book *Measure What Matters*. He learned much about this methodology directly from Andy Grove during his time at Intel. 

OKR, which stands for objectives and key resources, is a framework that provoke us to question if goals are strict or not and if it should be defined as long-term goals. As we hear, as we listen, as we read the details, these things that sometimes sound different might show a lot of similarities and good intentions. Therefore, and to be clear on our way of inquiry and our reflective moment, consider that we will seek less the "or" and will stick with the "and" for all the good things they have to give us. 

Let's consider Objectives and Key Results, from a general perspective. Does it require a main goal to exist? One such as a driving goal of 2 years? Yes, it is a way to go. It can and, according to the practitioners promoting it, it should. In terms having a defined goal ahead, John Doerr wrote it straight: 

> "An effective goal setting system starts with disciplined thinking at the top, with leaders who invest the time and energy to choose what counts."
>
> — Doerr, J. (2018). p. 50.

But a quick reading of that likely suggest an idea of a sort of visionary and disciplined being that knows. While when digging for the nuances, the leadership effort of goal-setting which they talk about has more to do with an initial effort of modelling goals with clarity: 

> "Leaders must get across the *why* as much as the *what*. Their people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission. " 
> 
> — Doerr, J. (2018). p. 50.

And it makes sense, doesn't it? For a solo founder, a team just starting, and for the big ones. Consider, for example, the life of one that feels motivated enough to do something, to put their hands, to work. It is natural that people enter to work in projects as they have goals, such as goals that are bold, such as goals that asks for people to work towards them. It also makes sense that people join goals to be part of something, such as for the cause of aiming for a different world when things come true.

Thereore, we can't deny that the subject of goals connects with motivation and meaning. In other words, the reason that goals matters have also to do with our roles in it. We should note that people join causes to work on them for a while and the meaning might also break down in terms of expectations for what can be done (what we are doing) and how things can be done (how are doing). People evaluate themselves against their goals. 

Therefore, it is not unwise to consider that, for teams and as teams unfold, the existence of a goals create a condition for them not only to join, due to motivations and interest in the outcome, but to engage in a movement where they seek to identify how they can contribute. In the "What Should I Contribute?" section of Managing Oneself, Peter Drucker (2008) recognized an extreme situation of when one is being told what to do, one one hand which certainly is not appropriate in modern management, and, on the other hand, the response inclination of "do your own thing." However, he concludes that the inclination to doing one's own thing doesn't suffice when striving to contribute, achieve self-fulfillment, and find success (pp. 53-54).

--> 

[Consider the picture, an illustration, of an X axis, with the "being told" and on the other extremme the "do your own thing" and, from the middle, comes an arrow towards the top, the "how should I contribute". ]

We should account here that John Doerr is known as the evangelist of OKR as a framework, a work he started at Google. As he has recognized in *Measure What Matters*, the framework was given to him by Andy Grove while he worked at Intel. In addition, Andy has credited that he improved his Objectives and Key Results with learnings from Peter Drucker. Therefore, it is not unwise to consider that the willingness for one to contribute, in an organization, has ties with the effort to manage oneself. Peter has elaborated a contribution for the individual version of it: 

> "What should my contribution be? To answer it, it must address three distinct elements. What does the situation require? Given my strenghts, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference." (Drucker, Peter. 2008. (pp. 35)

Thus it is uncommon for people to join projects, with causes and goals, as they know that their strenghts can be used for the situation that needs to be changed. And, as they feel that they can do something. Likewise, the structure of a goal-setting project, such as one having a clear documentation and expected results to favor the goal, is likely used by founders as they have to communicate round and improve their chances towards success.

[The storytelling that they produce, as they go, is also key as they struggle to get feedback and involvement from potential customers, inspire and hire developers, get support from investors, and a lot of more as they ask for help. But again, storytelling we will consider in the end of this part. ]

Therefore, it is not unwise to notice how we gravitate towards having a plan, an outcome ahead, and even a 2-year plan, as a key element that may put us in a position to solve what is needed to be solved. Plus there seesm to exist an alignment with the too many stories, as told, that we have seen, and read, and watched, and continue to witness; the too many examples of people that told that they were doing something as in to change the world and they did. Plus, if one feels that goal-setting in the corporate is more like a storytelling that fails, with lots of traps (and it does have), and as they dig, they will find an entire field of research related to goal-setting. But if we dig, it is undeniable that out of goal-setting, and after goal-setting, we can find that the reason for the whole field has to do with how we react, how we fix ourselves, as we go. We can't deny that the environment created by a goal-setting system has the good intention to shape us towards progress, even when progress is yet to be discovered in the innovation space. 

## Does OKR supports iteration and course-correction?

As we have covered, the viewpoint of OKR indicates that goals are quite strong. The other component of it has to do with the Key Results which is how the team moves to pull the goal closer. There is no doubt that OKR aims for achieving the objectives. In other words, the objective that is writen down is not to change. And that creates the condition for the performer to focus and work in the key results. The natural question, or complication with that idea, is exactly that it pulls the team towards being locked by the requirements of the goals and key results, which indeed could cause anxiety when the performer feels that things are not going well. Worse it is when, in the face of the feeling that things are not going well, the performer is pressured to work even more towards pre-defined key results, as if assuming that more effort would save the strategy. And, of course, when the matter involves the outcome not serving well, more anxiety certainly comes our way. 

Therefore, it is justifiable to question if OKR has mechanisms in place that supports teams to evaluate and course-correct what they do, as they go. In this direction, it is important to note that as much as OKR exists to help with pulling the objectives closer, OKR is also promoted as a framework that supports evaluation, which is primarily driven by the evaluation of the key results, as key results are executed, which consequently creates an opportunity for objectives to be evaluated, first against key results, but also in the face of the existing strategy or higher objectives. 

When it comes to translating objectives into actions, it certainly starts from the top, with a top-down modelling effort that is put in place where it all starts indeed with a big goal, whiten down as an objective. The modelling phase is part of the planning process intended to find things that we can do that can bring that objective closer. 

<!--

-->
[Check this with the Measure What Matters. ]

But then, with that idea, it is time to consider if OKR passes the complication pointed by David and Jason, who stated: 

> "the sooner you admit you have no idea what the world will look like in five years, three years, or even one year, the sooner you will be able to move forward without the fear of making the wrong big decision years in advance." (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 33).

Indeed, when working with innovative products, in a world that changes fast, that sounds about the situation that many founders live. It might come a situation of conflict when the findings pull the team to reconsider but in fact they feel that they cannot change direction, cannot be creative, or even when the team looses interest because things are too mechanical in the face of, as indicated, corporate anxiety. The situation becomes confusion as the required goal can create confusion in the face of other elements that are essential for the ones actually working, such as the things that comes after the question that Peter Drucker brought up: how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?

With that problem ahead of us, let us continue to investigate if OKR has course-correction that supports learning and evalution of the goals. The short answer is yes, although we have to acknowlege how difficult it is to use a goal-setting system that seems to offer an escape hatch for escaping the ship such as change the plan on the go. 

Consider an OKR that started with an initial objective, such as an objective that was created ahead of any work, such as one that comes from a mission or a vision. It does so with the purpose of pushing the design process of OKR into the modelling, or planning, for the steps that are thought to be steps that pulls the objective closer. 

This part, the Key Results part of OKR, appears first as a mechanism to keep track, that adds transparency, and which reveals what is being done and what is ahead. In additin, it is also a mechanism that offers a window of opportunity to see what goes on and how what is being done connects with where we want to go. Here is where OKR starts to get complicated as, in essence, it's becomes a collaboration mechanism. What I mean by complicated is that much more simpler to simply use OKR for tracking, as in a stream that goes to one direction, than for enabling it as a collaborative communication tool that allows teams to evaluate what they do, to change what they are tracking, if not to chage what they are going after. 

First looking at the simpler dimention of OKR, consider when one said that she is to write a book. She expects to deliver pages, or chapters, or to do a number of interviews, to come up with the articles, and to engage in several processes that would bring the objective closer. OKR asks her to pick a few key results that she believes will help. Although OKR doesn't go into strategy, what to pick, it proposes a system where the discussion happens, even for one working alone. If you write it down, and if you set your objectives, and if you set your key results, then you are writing it for the sake of letting collaboration to take place; so that you know, so that you can read, so that you can reflect. Therefore, it is less for the sake of presenting or keeping the score, or for serving as a personal grading for what was performed. It is, instead, for the sake of openning a window, a way to see, a way to talk, a discussin to happen, about the said, or written, key results; as as well the objective since it is all interconnected. With the communication going on, she can run the evaluation cycle and change her OKR for the next cycle. 

Now to consider more the complex, or collaborative aspect of OKR. To visualize a potential of OKR in organizations that reportedly does well, consider that some of them require individuals to post their OKRs, to share. This situation takes a great culture and great effort in the first place. They report benefits such as when an employee, by knowing what other employee is doing, can offer help indirectly such as to give hints, advices, and new ideas: 

> ".................." 

When exposing what we do, the things we are doing, and letting others chime in to help, even people that are not connected directly, it is natural to consider that the mechanism promotes communication and open ideas to flow in which would result in an opportunity to reduce self bias and improve not only effectiveness, in the sense of performance for what is being done and in the sense of the simpler nature of accounting and tracking, but also taken that this simpler factor is present, the more complex collaborative communication which is the opportunity to evaluate all that is being done.

I am here

It is valid to assert that OKR, as a framework, promotes the effort of colloration that involves, checking, evaluating, and changing direction. Consider, for example, another aspect of OKR where Key Results - as promoted by the viewpoint of John Doerr - can be defined as aspirational or commitment based. [Check the wording for these]. These approaches exist to accommodate the situations where a lot of learning, such as discovery, is involved, on one hand. While on the other hand, commitment based key results offers an approach to check progress for the moments that we know exactly what needs to be done. Again, the applicability and value from it depends on the strategic planning. 

But the evaluation of the what happens, according to the approach, is key and should be likely done at all times. Not only after the fact that when done properly communication and contributions happens indirectly as indicated. The natural execution of it requires constant evaluation that involves self review and peer review, such as a review with a manager. 

Of course, depending on the culture, toxic aspects can come the way to influence the process to offer no value. For example, depending on how the measurement of performance of an employee is done, such as when the compensation is associated with the Key Results and moving towards the Objective as written, then the results can be catrastrofic. Would one want to course correct its path, after having good reasons for so, after knowing that she or he could be evaluated as bad performer and even get fired? That kind of situation would certainly bring anxiety and a lot of distractions for a call that would not likely happen. 

It is important to pause here and reflect that a lot of companies indeed enters that mode. They set goals in stone, they put prizes for the ones that follows the path as written, they punish the ones that didn't do well. Then it comes the question, do they course correct? Yes but they do that in macro terms, by facing a crisis, which likely involve getting people fired, managers fired, teams reorganized. From the point of view of an employee, under a whole team that got fired for moving in the bad direction claiming it was good, the employee generally tries to escape the spiral of death by reclaiming that he was told to do that job and was performing well. In a lot of situations like that, a lot of people can get away. But still, anxiety was present and a lot of effort to manage the crisis which can and should be considered a bad use of the time of people. 

Therefore, it is ideal to think that a plan for progressing is not about a plan for evaluating people. This is a key aspect of the OKR approach that when well considered can make OKR become a useful tool and one that also serves well for course-correcting what happens towards the what matters. 

With a cadence for evaluating what is being done, with allowance for reviewing with transparency and strategic thinking too, the approach can help person to change the plan at the level of the Key Results and also Objectives. 

The subject of dropping a plan associated with an objective is referred a lot although likely not many get to the point of reading about these critical situations when a lot of the leaning happens with the intention of getting started.  

For Harrison Metal professor and investor Michael Dearing, that reported having talked with  the thousands about the subject [check the reference to this from the management course] the person has to do it quick, and review hundreds of times. By the way, he is okay with a big goal to exist too, such as a 2-year plan. But does it mean the objective is frozen? No. The purpose of doing, and the communication around, exists for the sake of changing things.

<!-- 

Consider too 

--> 

Check back to the situation as shown by David and Jason which they Said that they do checks for 6 weeks. Would they every 6 weeks change the direction of the boat too? Probably not. They might be in a condition that something else influences their 6 week plan. But would it means that they can't change the direction of their big boat? Of course no as well. They are likely in a better position, to learn and discuss, as they kept that idea of "maybe we will see. " Something is there being discussed, certainly, there is a direction, certainly. But at least thet positioned themselves to be open minded. The purpose of good goal setting systems are also to be open, to find better ways. 

The effort of redoing the OKR hundreds of times, is for the sake of being open. Now, in this regard, a question that comes is if OKR does not allow room for bottom-up contributions that affects the top-down. Part of it I have covered, the conversation is there. But the cycle for reviewing all the top down plan exists too and bottom-up contributions is recognized as key. In other words, the approach needs and depends on the confrontation of the what we want to do with the what is happening. Of course, the cadence for that sort of strategic planning work might have a cadence, needs a cadence applicable to the organization.

<!-- 

Perhaps it is applicable now to bring a 2 axis?

Now a question that comes out way is to consider the situation, the context. We need to reflect about the doing precise versus when learning. And how key results can be crafted. And for that we need to talk about outcome vs. output. Let's dive a bit into that.
