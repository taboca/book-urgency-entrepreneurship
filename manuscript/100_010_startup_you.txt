## Entrepreneurship and discovery

Everyone wants something good to happen to them. They often sin only when they choose activities or develop preferences that are not good for them. Sometimes they think that an activity will be good, but they head in only to find out later that it was not like what they thought would happen. This phenomenon derives from the individual's relationship with the system, with the world. But people are not always organized in the face of a world that is constantly changing or in face of the reality of who they are in the world. They often perform day-to-day activities through trial and error, living and learning.

In theory this is also a syndrome in the world of entrepreneurship as entrepreneurs try to launch their ideas into the world, already dreamed of, but in the face of reality they often have their ideas not accepted giving rise to frustration and even disappointment with art. In this environment, many give up. In this environment, some learn and succeed and others are lucky.

The idea of ​​this work is not to talk about the case of the lucky ones. On the other hand, here we will compile lessons from the world of entrepreneurship, from startups; but from the entrepreneurs who discovered that their actions depend on reality, on the world, on the market. Those who discovered were the ones who started to see the role of the entrepreneur as a role that must respond to the world. They are the ones who quickly found the disciplined side, rigorously, a management system that is prioritized by the world, by the external environment.

This idea of ​​contact with the world, establishing a rule of the game, is very well articulated in the statement by Steve Blank who says that No Business Plan Survives First Customer Contact [^ stevebusinessplan].

[^ stevebusinessplan]: Steve Blank's article in English https://steveblank.com/2010/11/01/no-business-plan-survives-first-contact-with-a-customer-%E2%80%93 -the-5-2-billion-dollar-mistake /

Perhaps we can articulate the version for the micro entrepreneur that "no prototype of a person survives the first contact with life, without learning." The situation above, which is a problem and a challenge for startups, in the personal version is also a problem since the individual may not carry out his routine with such rigid rigor in a very dynamic world of adversity.

The reality is that everyone lives in the world and many problems are problems with the relationship with the world. What happens is that we fall into the trap of distancing ourselves from the world and we can be in exactly the same situation as the vast majority of startups' ideas: Living in a state of frustration and confined in the pre-launch stage, not launching themselves into the world. The idea of ​​launching into the world can be, even in the field of personnel, very parallel to the idea of ​​launching a company:

In the case of the person, to launch is to relate right in the middle without being corrupting your internal values. She wants to be who she is, yes; at the same time it wants to be framed in the world. At the same time, she wants her interactions with the world to be valid, she wants to be adequate, to be embraced. At the same time, she ultimately wants to participate in relationships with the world that also make for a better world.

The start-up parallel would be:

An initial idea, a product and company dream, is still suitable for the market (the world). It needs to be born and leave the initial phase, as a prototype of an idea, and enter a market without going over its values. Once it relates to the world, which provides services and at the same time earns profits, it is seen as appropriate. Once adequate, it wants to establish itself in the market in a lasting and productive way. To do this, she knows she has to do something good for her constituents: employees, partners, investors, suppliers, customers, and partners; consequently to the world.

With that we will look at the person as an Idea of ​​Being who wants to be embraced by the world and find its purpose and last. Based on the parallel of the startup, we will bring a little rigor and productivity management - recommendations for a better life. This is because the world of entrepreneurship, linked to management, has found a way that supports successful entrepreneurs: The way to manage learning in the face of failure hypotheses and with the aim of reaching truths faster.

Based on the lessons of the entrepreneur's realities, the next sections are recommendations for a better management of the being, of the individual.

### Every action of the individual is an activity in the world

First, we are going to look at the world of startups but soon after we are going to take a comparison and lesson for ourselves. On the startup side, we can say that every action of a startup is an action in the world. For beginning entrepreneurs, this idea can be somewhat confusing precisely because a startup, being the company before the company, is much more based on the idea, the concept. That is, in the initial phase it is not the product, it has no customers, partners or constituents.

But modern entrepreneurship teaches us that it is not necessary to distance yourself from the world simply because they are not yet launched. Far from it, in fact, startups find their ways by establishing a relationship of interaction with the world. But what world is this? How can dreamers, co-founders who have romantic action ideas designed for the future, be able to use the world to launch their platforms? They establish a design action, which can be seen as an arc, with a beginning and an end. First, they define their goals as they want their ideas to be turned into products and put on the market. So they assume that they can make a design effort. And look, design, for entrepreneurs is not the guarantee of getting it right. Far from it. The design process is precisely related to the idea of ​​placing a north and from the north to define exercises and interactions with the world in order to learn. It has more to do with predicting, prototyping, with reflection, with permission to talk to the world; precisely because we can try to marry two sides: the idea side with the reality side of the world (or in the case of startups, the market). In this field, entrepreneurs try to create rigor to at the same time allow their crazy ideas, potentially inadequate, to be placed in some thesis. They just want to know more truths and for that they will elaborate theories, or propositions; they will create different exercises that are of the order of interaction with the world. They do research, they talk, they listen, they dare. All these actions that are done are done in the world and they can often perform much of this effort without even having to place big bets. That is, they do not need to produce something imperfect as they can look at who they are, as they can reflect on their abilities and their learning capacities. They don't have to launch a flawed product - they can interview people, talk to experts, for example.

So, from the world of entrepreneurs, we have a lesson for our entrepreneurship on a personal level:

We can talk to the world, listen more, dare more; even without implementing. With this conversation, we can discover more about our hypotheses, our frustrations and desires. Communication is our inexpensive, often happy and positive, way to obtain truths. With it we can better establish a connection with the world, which is great. And we have to think like entrepreneurs because, you see, entrepreneurs are constantly testing their crazy ideas. So, yes, we can be different and we must be aware that the world on our side is not exactly the world. That we can test our ideas (of life, sometimes crazy) with a bigger environment. No entrepreneur launches something crazy asking only to people on the side, like family members. The entrepreneurial spirit calls for greater communication with the external environment, precisely because it believes in this space, in this opportunity. Before you launch, or better on the way to launch, you can prototype, test everything you want to do. Just do this with the world and not in isolation. Don't let yourself be tricked into trying to launch yourself by doing a nice unexpected surprise with a lot of effort put in at once. You can learn from everyday life, from the environment to the side.

Nobody fails overnight. Our failures can take a lifetime.
Brian Chesky, founder of Airbnb, had the opportunity to receive good advice from entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham. Good advice, revealed in the interview with Reid Hoffman, says that "Startups don't die, they disappear". Brian is referring to the situation where the founders of startups have a big competition which is the life activities of each co-founder - they have life, they have day to day activities, they go to conferences and even holidays.

These activities of each co-founder member, for Brian, are the number one enemy of startups that can make them disappear, very slowly; disappearing. In this case the co-founders are worthy of work, they are involved, but at the same time they may not even realize it and like, after decades, that idea didn't work and it was a boat that never really sank but it sailed to an isolated place and nobody even noticed.

The good news, at least clear for companies, is that the market dictates the rules. So, successful entrepreneurs know this because they put a more appropriate agenda, better tied to the market - they are better off navigating with feedback. So the version of focus or dedication in the case of startups is a group of united co-founders who, over time, start to less fight with their different ideas because they are increasingly aligned with an external north, fed by the market that is the world or the external environment.

Inspired by this focus version of startups, perhaps people can also focus better. Focusing on personnel does not have to be working for work, or dedicating for dedicating - far from it. On the other hand, we can make a commitment to ourselves to first know that we are living or working for a reason: We are trying to discover and execute our life project. And given this project, we will have many activities that will be taking place in parallel and that we must be aware of their presence. So we can formulate:

Focus begins with the ability to perceive, identify, the role of our daily activities in relation to our life goals.


But yes, life or our convivial environment, can put complicated tasks and challenges in front of you. But then we can just ask for help to the entrepreneurial spirit that is creative. With a little creativity, you can look at the activities you do today, you can see how they relate to or align with the area or the direction you want to take, experiment or learn.

Ultimately we can be inspired by the vision presented by Brian Chesky - we can look at the course of the boat we are on and see if it is not necessarily sinking at once. He may simply be sailing in any direction or we can row one way and sometimes the other. This phenomenon of sailing for sailing, or working for working, or living for living is usually more defining a frustrating future than adverse situations that some people live in, for example: Losing a job or finding themselves in front of a super challenge. It is not by chance that many success stories happen after critical or even tragic things. It is no coincidence that super entrepreneurs are born from the life they had in dysfunctional families - usually these situations are more adverse and give people clear lessons. From these life lessons we can articulate that it is better to embrace the idea of ​​learning from the lesson of the moment than to leave a small boat sailing anywhere in a fog.

Small betting on big bets
Startups that have seen successful companies know how to insert their hypotheses without letting go of what they have. They establish a system of rigor for the evaluation of ideas and thus they can accelerate when necessary….

Establish your values ​​and identity and allow progress

Adversity is the premise of the entrepreneurial spirit

Failure should serve to boost

Browse for feedback: Art and its facets
First-time entrepreneurs don't know how to collect feedback. They fall for the trick, for example, of asking for feedback to people like the mother. The mother gives protection and can lie and her lie, worthy based on honor, can end the chance of an idea becoming a company ...

Some entrepreneurs, a much smaller group, understand that feedback is better when it is considered. The successful entrepreneur often prefers feedback from those who do not want their good to those who want their good; precisely because he understands this question of the false positive.

No personal plan should be as rigid as the old business plan
We can be inspired by Steve Blank's articulation and metaphor that says that no business plan survives contact with the first customer. In its article [1] the story of Iridium, a super cellular network with 100% coverage in the world, made by satellites was presented; but that when it launched its mega system at an investment of 5.2 billion it was too late - the world already had cheap cell phones. Steve pondered the reality of the new business world that is no longer just based on the traditional business plan, too rigid. The old vision of the business plan needed a modern treatment based on learning and discovery; thereby embracing concepts such as pivoting and iterating.

If even businesses have already learned that you cannot write a rigid plan, why should we embrace opportunities as if it were a static plan. Maybe we can learn, now that even big companies already know, that we can pivot, that we can iterate with the environment. Perhaps we can get along with the idea of ​​learning and discovery. Perhaps we can still not only embrace this idea but also engage in a less rigid way of living. The human being, as a resource of a world in movement, can better adapt and fit. Once we accept that things are moving, that they are dramatically changing (precisely because civilization has been successful in certain areas) we will be able to better see ourselves not as static individuals, who have a defined and rigid role.

Large companies know this - they know that, for example, those who grow the most are those who change course within their careers. The personal pivot within the company is an inflection phenomenon because it changes everything. Although it is a story that still happens with few, in the corporate sphere, it may have less to do with luck and more to do with the openness that some people allow themselves. Some people simply try, dare, or let themselves go. Let's see - they allow them to pivot.

It is said but we are already living it - most people live moving from jobs to jobs, like a job every few years. So, on the one hand, the story of the pivotability of the person who works within the company is still not so typical; pivoting outside the company or between companies is more typical.

Now, let's think that our planet is a big company. If everything is a big company, we can conclude that everyone is more and more testing themselves, getting to know each other, discovering themselves; they are changing jobs within the same company. That, at the end of the day, or the days, people are more and more looking for a better fit. This is human nature and our ability to adapt to the environment. What confused us was precisely a period of industry and civilization where we humans were used for our ability to work physically - yes, an immutable condition. On the other hand, we can now better embrace our nature, the being that works and changes the world and lives in the changing world. Yes, we can embrace the idea that we are beings that work with knowledge, and since knowledge is our environment and space, we can change our role. Yes, we can pivot and we must above all be open to find our potential, of happiness, because with it comes the energy to walk, to discover.

The future is not the situation where people actually move between attempts to adapt companies and projects with the world. The future is simpler and different: We will have 4-10 "jobs" at the same time precisely because these things will leave the idea of ​​employment as a prison and security a little, the traditional one that you had to return home to. In the new future that no longer sees things as fixed jobs, or work, we are more learning and simply living with ourselves and the world, adapting and trying to do the best. It is a space of constant self-learning. If we embrace this idea, we are better able for this world and we agree, it can be much better.
