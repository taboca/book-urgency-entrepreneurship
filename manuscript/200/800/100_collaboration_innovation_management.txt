## The team, searching for the new collaboration potential

It's not always evident how the work environment contributes to the team's productivity. For example, imagine that you are a guitarist that just earned your place in a famous band. If the band has ten shows scheduled, that means a lot to you in terms of focus. When you are on a fast-moving train, the dynamism of the work environment gives you focus.
Think about the many elements going on that maintain focus, enabling everyone to be productive - preparing for the event, the performance, the audience, live footage, interviews, and a lot more.
But what happens when a big part of that environment is suddenly removed? Can teams suddenly rearrange themselves? Consider how COVID-19 is impacting many groups in many industries. In the face of this new reality, the abrupt arrival of new demand for online usage makes it difficult for teams to grasp what is going on. Worse is it to consider how to improve productivity when things need to go virtual. Many groups will dismiss the effort of learning with the idea that they can go back to their optimal way of work as soon as possible.

In this essay, I will look at the case of a band that, like many others, had to adapt to the new online environment. But unlike many others, they were able to improve their performance as online collaborators. The situation that sparked this writing came about when a bass player told me about a new experience that his band got involved in. It's something known as a collab.
This collab effort aims to deliver an online video music production where each band member records their track on their own. With each part recorded, things eventually come together in the post-production phase. Some of these collab efforts may produce a kind of video known as split-screen. To contextualize the split-screen experience, check the following example of a self-made collab authored by Beaker:


After learning about his exciting team project, I have decided to interview the band's CEO to learn more. Before you move on, you may want to check their collab effort for the song I Write Sin Not Tragedy.
It's impressive how their production looked professional, considering how new they were with the process. But more impressive was their ability to work collaboratively. Once they decided to enter "collab mode on," they engaged themselves differently.
The *new thing* in their process is that these four musicians had to dive into a different collaboration process. Yes, they were familiar with some professional techniques - studio environment, post-production, and such.
But a significant challenge consisted of maintaining their level of productivity when everybody was working from home.
According to Marco, the drummer and band's CEO, one of the significant challenges was the number of activities going on with their lives. This problem was aggravated as COVID-19 pushed them to do many more activities online. His concern resonated with the notion of the start-up enemy recognized by Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky:
And I think the enemy of a start-up is everyone else's life. It's true. You have a life, and you have vacations, and you have conferences, and you go away, and you do other stuff, and it's like, that's the enemy of start-up. You know, Paul Graham used to say, "Start-ups don't die, they just fade away." Brian Chesky @ (Greylock, 2015, 21min19sec)
So it wasn't as simple as - let's go digital and do this collab thing. Well, at least not for them. When I first learned about their project, I thought that their primary problem had to do with the barrier of recording from home. But after learning the basics, I knew it was a thing of the past - a recent history anyway. So yes, a regular band would generally be worried about recording from their homes. But that challenge was solved by the market with the help of first movers. It takes no search effort to see the movement's magnitude - see Bon Jovi - It's My Life (Live from Home 2020).
For them, stranger than these strange days was the new norm where bands were flooding their audiences with low-quality collab videos. They realized that they didn't want to digitalize themselves over the weekend.
Although they could join the movement in a hurry, they took a more professional attitude instead. In the end, their patience with the process yielded better results. They also didn't dismiss the movement - what many good bands may have done anyway.
Their approach to it consisted of entering this "lower-bar game" to explore the category of work. But as they engaged, they allowed room for their identity to be revealed with more time and dedication. With that, they pursued their objective, which involved working more, dedicating more, working collaboratively, and aiming a better collab video.
These musicians became proud of their process of work. They uncovered more about themselves in the face of the new approach. As a team, they have engaged themselves to lower the willpower bar that was much higher in the online medium. Keep in mind how much more comfortable and engaging it is for professional bands to focus on their studio or at the show's settings.
But once they have decided to work - remotely - they found a coworking model that energized their ability to work. Now they know - they can effectively work remotely in the sense of composing and collaborating online as a team.
For this band, and the many teams out there, it's clear that COVID-19 didn't bring new remote teamwork solutions overnight. The strangeness in the air is the unfortunate reality where not many will have time to experience and learn from what is going on. This band's approach to it reminded us that teams could have options beyond merely digitalizing their work or dismissing the whole movement. With patience and committed effort, teams can better experiment to work online, better learn what is going on, and seek better opportunities.

Many thanks to Jorge Olive, the bass player, for his engaging presentation related to the process. Additional thanks to Marco for his contribution to the qualitative interview. Congratulations Mr.Dam!
