# In peace with communication

<!-- scqa: subject --> 

The purpose of this section is to help entrepreneurs to invest in communication that is generally seen as persuative, which is often dismissed as being manipulative, often seen as too complex or too subjective, especially given that importance is given to the truths such as data. The lack of interest becomes a problem, not only because being persuasive is important in the context of startups which depend on support from a range of audiences; but because it prevents entrepreneurs to get involved with communication in an organized a conscious approach where communication is actively used to achieve clarity more than to a the limited purpose of trying to convince. 

<!-- scqa: situation --> 

In the entrepreneurial setting, communication exists to cause change, such as to get a proposal approved, to offer a viewpoint about a situation that needs attention, to explain how something works and how to use it, and more. Therefore, what we communicate serves to goals and driven to an audience. From there, we minimally ask their attention, if not engagement, it invites them to join, to collaborate, and more, such as when an entrepreneur asks for money from an investor. 

But as the day goes by under the pressures to innovate, team's failing with communication is part of the job. If audiences gets confused, if objections are raised, such as when an investor asks a founder to stop before they get to the point, these are nuisances, although inconvenient but at the same time acknowledged as legitimate. In other words, what has to be told has to be told and if it isn't heard in as expected then we turn right into finding our way around. In other words, it is through failures in  communication that we serve the rational purpose of entrepreneurship. With that, the urgent-and-fast corporate culture of communication focuses in the results from the dynamics, such as going after the truths to be uncovered, the data that proves. This approach does not only seem honest but it allows the conversation to happen, as it is inclusive and debatable. Thus, our lower priorization to invest in communication has ties with the fears that we would be failing with rationality and reason, which can be quite evident especially in the early stage conditions where the offering is being designed, the customers are being discovered, which appears that the investment in communication is a waste given that it is seen as a tool to sell better, to convince, and the like.  

<!-- 
## scqa: complication 
--> 

Now, the complication isn't that investing in communication is wrong - such as in an extremme to be seen as an evil act. But when entrepreneurs consider further investment, and compare the extremmes of poor communication with substance vs. quality communication lacking substance, they rather invest in what seems to be logical, and applicable to the urgency, which favors value as logically no value may fully exist yet, which pushes them to think that quality in communication serves the the communication purpose for when things are ready. This takes us to ignore communication as a valuable investment that can support the growth process of the startup, as it is developed. With that, we continue to communicate in inneficcient ways, to confuse our teams, our audiences, and the many others in our ways. What is even worse is that, as we ignore investing in communication and yet use communication to get something of them, we favor focusing on more reasons to convince, such as data, which puts pressure on the team to engage in being excessive focus, if not obsessive, towards adding value to what is being offered, if not engaging in manipulating the data. 

To support founders to value communication, not as a solution sell something ready, but as a tool to support collaboration with the audiences in front of us, we will first look at how we dismiss communication, what could be perceptions pushing us to lower investing in communication. Then we will see why it matters, by honoring that the growth machine depends a flow of communicative experiences with multiple audiences that demands a solutions-oriented style, and other potential risks of overfocusing in the offering and wasting resources with a higher disconnect with the audience. Finally, you will be introcuced to a logical and structured way to advance to communication, referred as Executive communication, which not only helps with solutions-oriented audiences but makes sense as a way to organize ideas thus works like a self-cleaning oven for improving the offering. 

## Dismissing communication

<!-- scqa: abstract 

it might be style - How it is experienced, it might be style, the deductive mind seens investment in communication as lower, favors value towards what seems rational, logic, data - pulls them to focus on data. We can't see even the true induction, or abuse, if not waste or investment, by the insertion of data. 

--> 

From one communication to another there seems to have different ways of doing it, like as if some people do it with style. Some people struggle with the effort but somehow put out their ideas in a relatively clear, although not persuasive. Others put a lot of work, struggle, work and rework, and nothing sticks. While, on the other hand, some folks come in the stage and by using a few sentences appear to be in the right time and space, and by what quite effortlessly say they can quite brutally silence others thoughts of reason and even greater ideas. In other words, what sounds more coherent flows better. 

This kind of communication that seems persuasive is all around and a reason that we may ignore might actually have to do with it's potential effectiveness. As I was having coffee when starting the draft of this article, I heard a person passing by leaving a voice message. He said "What did you think of my idea?" And right away added that "although it is not the best idea, what do you think?". After that I couldn't hear more but I thought that he was trying to silence a potential objection such as "that is not the best idea," on the other end. And by doing so, he seemed to be given a shortcut as one that adds that "we won't have the time to pick the perfect idea. Let's move on for now with this one." 

Although this illustration is a fragment of a communicative experience, these fragments seems to work like a sort of a grease to the working machine, it seems to show persuasivess, with intentions to convince, and if not a hint of a type of communication that can be wrong, such as where the appealing aspects are louder and while the supporting arguments are ignored. 

But when I rested to think of that fragment of communication, I happened to realized that I was judging too much, perhaps mad by the potential risk, but what if it was the right sentence said in the right moment and time? I mean, what if I had heard the rest of the conversation and the other side said a loud and clear "I agree." What if, on the other end, his manager was there, waiting for the idea after the fact that the day before he had asked the subordinate to come up with a more pragmatic solution. Then, if that was the case, it would be then the right sentence on the right time and moment, and then the analysis could come out differently. I would then acknowledge that he was being respectiful to his audience, his manager, that he indirectly acknowledged the "Why am I here" implicit question of his manager, that he had acknowledged the complicatin that his manager were concerned, to find a good idea that would be good enough, and giving his solution. Therefore, under this new lenses that part of the story was already outstanding and implied in the narrative, then it would be possible, although in my imagination, that the communication experience would be persuasive in a good way. 

But one way or another, it seemed that my views had seen these fragments of communication as serving a purpose, such as convince, or sell, as if the communication were a thing that would be immutable where on the other hand the offering is also immutable. Just like a communication about a car exists to sell after the fact that the car was produced. This inclination, seems to feed the very thinking of my lack of interest for communication as something that can be worked on, that can be improved. 

As in the more I see communication that is ready, like a shiny offering (good or bad), the more I get used to ignoring communication until the moment is right, which can be a problem for entrepreneurs, as the moment is not right exists while communication need to exist to get there. 

### Busy with analysis

But even though if communication is generally perceived as a ready-made thing needed in a transactional world, still the judgements during the communicative experiences are quite strongly observed. To illustrate the rise of another critic style, consider an episode where I went to the supermarket, at the deli section which usually a place I care due to my Italian origins. There, a lady were there to help and we were there to buy mozzarella cheese, we apparently needed about 7 ounces of it. But before we said the amount, she suggested that we buy the mozzarella that were pre-packaged, pre-sliced, that happeed to come with another 7 ounces of prosciutto. She added that by buying the combo the mozzarella would be cheaper. But we were also in a hurry, and not there to reason, to think, such as to reflect about the ways people communicate or even to pick ideas for a book. We were just there to buy the cheese. But I was there as a critic, and having entered in the mode of doing basic math, which is something I do when buying things. In a way or another, in a hurry or not, we seem to never ignore the math. Since I needed data, I asked her how much was the cost per pound for mozzarella alone - to which she said 25 Brazilian Reais and immediately added that the per-pound-cost for the combo was 18, therefore cheaper. Indeed, the basic math seemed to work and she also smiled and added that she was there to help. But then I asked about the per-pound-cost for the prosciutto to which she said to be about 13. At this point I fent confused that she didn't add that in the combo the prosciutto became 18. So being there, with no much to do and not too hungry, I've told her that she was selling he prosciutto at a higher price. She smiled and said again that she was there to help. But this time she also added that I could either accept the help or not. Being that the love of my life was also next to me, waiting, i had decided to keep the marriage, enjoy the Saturday, moved on, although I had to imagine myself kicking the shelf. We picked the pricey prosciutto with the cheaper mozzarella because, I guess, as we weren't there to fully pause the movie of life. Needless to observe is that the attendant would be likely following her job, equally in urgent mode, likely following orders. 

This more elaborated fragment shows a mechanism that exists to serve a potential need, like an urgent need of sales, and a potential need of the audience. Therefore, take aside right or wrong, it certainly shows persuasiveness, although at the risk of failing after the fact-checking. But it also shows that there are situations when some of us may wear a hat, like me, where we engage a defense mechanism against a potentially evil communication, where the math matters, where fact-checking matters, which involves a process of checking if what was said which sounds coherent comes with data that supports. 

<!-- 

note: Marcio had written, in a note about the above, that a paradox was evidenced. I have no idea of this paradox, perhaps worth to consider. 

--> 

Now, the point to be made is that when doing that we might in fact favor rationality, favor the fact-checking aspect. It is not to say that we ignore communication and the aspects of coherence. We do recognize it, and in fact may do so quite well, like we recognize when that sort of train comes, on time, when the sound of induction comes our way, like the sound of a train arriving which prompts us to enter it. But as we do so, we also tend to see if it carries the cargo, if value has in its wagons. In other words, the more we see fast trains of thought carrying useless cargo, the more we are inclined to engage in the - quite needed process of - analysis which suggest to us that communication aspects, the train, is not as important, that can be secondary. Which is not, by the way, a bad mechanism to exist, although from the needs of this chapter, it does not help much. 

### Favoring reason 

Now, if people go away from being persuasive, they might do so with an inclination that it adds nothing, if not it could be an investment misleading themselves. One in that position, such as an entrepreneur, could fear to look like a salesman in hurry and intended to convince in bad ways which disregard value. But even if they consider to invest in communication responsibly, still it might be a problem with folks like creators, makers, engineers, and whoever looks at things from a logical, or a systems-oriented mindset. These folks may see themselves as supporters, responsible for the actual cargo, the values, what matters. They might also love deduction, to prove, to come up with the how-to, to work with more logical and structured ideas, to fill out the details with truths, and the like. This is quite evident in the situation of entrepreneurs as, of course, they love and want to express their ideas, and they recognize the importance of being understood by audiences in a way that make moves forward. But still, they rather use their time to focus in the inner works, or inner proofs, and the supporting elements that makes ideas to become good solutions. 

Therefore, while there is an acknowledgement that focusing in communication helps with the grease required that makes everything moving smoothly, still higher importance is given to the works for things like substance, truths, or data, which are the gears of the working machines. In other words, their job becomes the duty of trying to convince the communication folks, the translators. And as they focus a lot on trying to prove things, when they win an acknowledgedment, they can get so excited that it all makes sense, which contributes even more to ignore the possibility that they didn't needed to show as much to prove if they had worked better in the actual communication. In other words, when proof is given to a point that the magic click happens, such as "Now I got and thanks for the prototype," a potential for a post-mortem analysis for how communication happens is dead. 

Now, there are many reasons why to focus first in value, second in communication, and it is generally quite valid. One other example might have to do understanding that the roles that focus more on coherence, the ones concerned with the audience and interested in persuading them, might not generally understand what is up and coming, such as what is new and innovative. A major reason for that is that these folks are too tied with the needs of the audiences, thus they can be representative of the market needs, be pressured by the market. Thus, given that what is outstanding might not be yet fully meaningful to the audience, the role of the expert communication would either not get it or force the offering to be appealing, which can be seen by the one working in the value to be a not so honest movement. This might be yet another reason supporting the lack of interest in communication, keeping the doers to believe in what they believe without changing the underlying assumption - supported by an unshakable faith - which sets them to try to solve communication needs not with one arm but with both arms tied behind their back.  

### Managerial ignorance

* p1 ( ) 040_induction_embedded_everything - Management fails to support communicators - In some of the Blitzscaling talks, if I am not mistaken, it was said that communication is like an aspect that people won't point to anyone as it seems like harrasment #clothes #dressing. Check this because I would think that this seems to be real in corporations. / ref 498498249-428482948294-4289482948-42984892

--> 


Now, in the corporate setting, no one tells the writer-doer that they are being observed that they are failing with communication, that their failures are okay, that they can invest and grow with communicative experiences, that they could fail, and fail, and learn, and improve their communication skills, such as to achieve clarity and to be able to communicate better with their colleagues and audiences. Although the executive level, such as the CEO or a anyone in a senior position, are in a good position to recognize that as a truth, it is rarely told to the doers. It maybe so due to fear, such as fear that talking about one's writing, or one's communication, would offend or sound like harassement. 

On top of that, goes the fact that senior people, are not good critics to support communicative experiences, that they grew up in a space where they would - in case they expose their criticism - do more in terms of criticizing with an orientation to the eyes of their maturity levels, such as involving the prism of expecting outcomes, which would naturally bring about the sort of product or market oriented critics, not the critics that promotes learning and advancement, which would be considered for them not even a critics, but more like mentorship. Their level, their position, the the moment where a potential willingness to be a critic comes about, is not even a moment for educating, for motivating, for looking at potential value. It's more like a review to avoid risks. Then, with that, nothing is done. You are on your own. 

Another aspect, to not touch communication investment for the subordinate, is that the process is more collaborative, and that the communication will rise anyway. Thus, in the face of any potential side impact of the focus in works towards value, or valuing arguments more than coherence, which takes a long ride - as we can be spending time, attention, interest, getting frustrated, burning our attention and effort to try to make sense of things - it is generally taken as the cost and where collaboration happens. 

Another factor is that management plays a role in communication from a translation perspective. In other words, managers are in between the top-down concerns, representing or translating the higher-level interests under a solutions-oriented perspective, and the bottoms-up concerns where the systems-orientation are considered critical. 

Thus, under the pressure of the normal corporate space, the roles might indeed gravitate for one or other side where generally some people better with communication seems to move towards the solutions-oriented space where some people better with creation seems to move to the systems-oriented space while some people are translators. To point an example, if a manager sees a subordinate doing a good job in the fields of productization, like prototyping, he would be likely to allow that subortinate to invest their own time to overperform in improving the prototype the demo day. In other words, managers will be more comfortable to identify and recognize the growth of individuals as they gravitate towards one or other end. 

## Unavoidable 

Back in other chapters of my Silicon Valley life, I had an opportunity to see myself as a victim of a kind of communication which I had considered to be an ugly case which I learned the hard way, when my English were poor but I wasn't afraid to say things and try to persuade using what I could. So in a given meeting I said something like "bada big bada bum, korben, bada bum bada bum," and quite quick a manager chimed right on top of that train of sound and sharply threw his crisp and clear English that started with "But more importantly,.." to which I don't recall what happened next but the fact that everyone had agreed. 

That was a prelude to a lesson I sort of sensed but could not grasp at the time. The real thing I didn't see is that the event was remarkable in my life but remarkable in a bad way which had prepared my investment towards communication, unfortunately, to be stuck in terms of investing. In other words, I wasn't in peace with with using induction, or inductive communication, because that way of communication seemed to be a deal breaker, or deal maker. Perhaps I have seen that in my whole life - in a way or another - but it was too brute to see a manager in a place which I thought as special - Silicon Valley the open book of opportunities. And, to be fair, perhaps implied in what happened that day was the fact that I did my part too - that what I tried to say had paved the way for that manager to bring some equilibrium to the meeting. In other words, in his defense, I started and he reacted in a way to be optimial, perhaps a pragmatic way. Well but for me that was an ugly case which seemed to be judging with a sort of jargon, which took me decates to be in peace with communication and even to come to the realization that the machined needed to be pragmatic anyway, likely the manager needed to move on. 

### Data can be evil 

These are the folks that can actually transform their solid ideas in solid proposals that can get accepted. BUt then under the condition of being certain that they can't focus in persuading, they are left with the tools they have. Therefore, they can use critical thinking, and logic, and do the design work, and research, and find data. 

Sometimes a prototype can prove, sometimes a full proof is given, this is the beautiful side, sort of innevitable when effort and intent is high, and when purpose exists, and even in a world where no one understand, if they have resources. But, as likely the by-product of going in that direction, they might also die before they have time to prove, part A. And if that is not enough what can be really tricky is that they may actual do a kind of work that is in a way like what the bad salesperson would do, although no evil is perceived; when they are inserting data enough to prove, although not quite intended as a conscious evil act but as they do, they materialize an evil with no awareness of it, even to a point that does worse than the salesperson that attempts to persuade with no given value offered exactly because that salesperson would be less likely to convince. 

But more than the harm to the business, is that the devotion towards being functional, such as to add proofs, takes the doer to workaround, or to prove anyway, or even in extremme situations, when they can be lying to themselves. As an illustration of a case, not apparently harmful, I recalled a situation when I was a web developer for a known Silicon Valley company. I had joined a team that had the responsiliby to make a graphics theme for a popular mail system. As part of the work we had to write a lot of lines of code, using color codes. I came up with an idea to automate but when trying to explain in the meeting, I happened to not rework how to communicate my idea and had given to them straight as in using a sort of narrative format explaining the idea how it worked likely inserting some arbitrary points about the mechanism. I tried and didn't work, then I went to the board to try to explain how to do the solution, it didn't work, then I almost tried again to insist in a different way when my manager asked me to not bring that idea again. I was frustrated, mad, silenced in front of the team but the worse was really my frustration that I could not win their trust. I left the room, mad, and went straight to the office of a software engineer, asked him if he could write the code to automate the process of theme generations, and he had the script ready. Eventually it worked and the team had accepted. Now, to defend my manager, of course many ideas can work, if you have time and resources. Perhaps in that situation end up being well because the other engineer had the time not only to understand but also to do it. But the real point which I missed was that I was too arbitrary when making propositions to a team, telling them the bits and pieces of ideas always in my own view and not formatting the ideas properly to the audience.  

As a sidenote to this notion and idea, I seem to be communicator that didn't happen in my youth but that found some traction in the world of user interfaces first, like prototypes, then in the world of high tech companies working with interfaces and prototypes. I grew up with some frustrations with communication and likely also mad with the bad salesperson - likely made me to be in a denial to the art of communicating well such as to persuade. But then, being decades and decades around software developers, I came to the full realization of how many iterations of software developers are so well crafted, so well promoted, by their shining prototypes; and alltogether the so many instances of those creations that meant nothing, that left as partial prototypes, as ideas projected, illusions too, and illustions that had teased in fact by the shinning and apparent materialization in front of buyers, buyers like customers, investos, and themselves, that had given the buy-in and later cried. Which makes developers a potential worse kind of salesperson that won't even notice when they lie as they lie to themselves by being involved with the perceived materialization of what they had in mind. This day made me happy with the salesperson that mainly deals with what they have to sell and their reputation with the customer as they are to be likely to see the customer in the next day, as they are showing their faces. Therefore, the systems-oriented folks can also enter the game of persuasion, however at another level, by overfocusing in trying to make their paintings to stand, such as my using an excessive amount of nails. Now, if they minimize their willingness to put mails, they are to face the "yet another test" against all the external folks they need help. It's a balance. 

### Growth 

<!-- scqa: k "it might be style" k1.k1

But it becomes vital to whoever in a position where substance, such as value, has to be created and at the same time the survival for the idea depends on convincing others issessantly, such as to depend on kind of sales after sales, starting with co-founders, to customers, colleagues, partners, investors. This is the situation of founders advancing with their startups where they are tested all the time. Consider the point of view given by Marc Andreessen about the need to invest in the formal presentation: 

> *“For investors, the formal presentation is yet another test. I think the formal presentation is another test . . . As a founder, if you are not good enough at your job as a CEO, to get up and present, to institutional investors, for 60 minutes, and sell them on your thing . . . We love when somebody walks in and has a compelling pitch so we can give them a check . . . that is a successful day for us. In contrast, every other pitch you ever gonna make is going to somebody that is going to be much worse than us … Customers, they are going to be like — no, I am not going to give you any money — like their default position right? Engineers — you going to try to recruit engineers, and they got 20 other job offers, so why does your pitch is going to be much better than the other 20 startups?”* Marc Andreessen (Y Combinator, 2016, 11:49)

Now, considering that startups deal with multiple audiences, with a product that doesn't fully exist, customers that are yet to be discovered, where not a clear sense for who will help with what; the inclination to use communication as a tool at a later stage, such as a tool to promote, or to convince, goes against the actual necessity where actively communication happens for the sake of improving communication with the audience which requires the continuous interest to discovery why all communication matters to every single audience. This forces the communication experience to be serve the needs of growth, forces the holistic view of growth, forces transcendence, away from manipulative communication, as you are communicating to all stakeholders using the same mechanism, such as your own team. Thus, looking from this angle, that tests are happening, working in communication for the sake of serving the tests have more to do with acessing the audiences other than tricking everyone; through that clarity for the values, vision, product, customers, cofounders, investors, all happens. 

## Executive communication 

While we have seen ideas for how communication is generally ignored, and reasons for why it matters, still it is a problem when we feel inclined to develop this area in a way that is tuned to the needs of entrepreneurs - as in strategic communication for startups - instead of an orientation where communication is used as a tool for a product that is ready.

Fortunately, a good direction exists and does justice to the need for using communication to serve the purpose of growth. And here is where we turn our attention to an enlightening talk -  Executive Communication (Heavybit, 2019) - from Michael Dearing, of Harrison Metal [^footnote_harrisonmetal], and the remarkable work of Barbara Minto, available as a book entitled The Minto Pyramid Principle (2016) [^footnote_barbara_pyramid].

Before we embark in Executive Communication with them, let us celebrate the challenge that Barbara set herself to solve, as she realized that a lot of books which were focusing on how to write, and even said things like "Be logical" or "Have a logical outline," but didn't focus in organizing the thinking that were required to make sentences, paragraphs, and ideas, to be logical. Her discovery, the pyramid, was the result of the effort to find out how to differentiate a logical outline from an illogical one (1996). In Michael's talk (2019), he had humorously compared the challenge to learn about communication with the a meme known as "How to Draw the Owl" [^footnote_meme_draw_the_owl]: 

![Draw the Own Meme](images/300/meme-draw-the-owl.jpg)

[^footnote_meme_draw_the_owl]: The "Draw the Owl" meme consists of an illustration with humorous tone that shows the oversimplification of complex processes, such as guides. The meme has a two-panel image which is a drawing tutorial where, on the left, the image shows two circles, like the body of the owl and the head, with a supporting text indicating "Draw some circles." On the right, a detailed drawing of a whole owl is shown with suporting instructions as "Draw the rest of the fucking owl." 

### Cracking the code

In this section, I will take you through a story of how Barbara took herself in the direction to "crack the code" of communication. The reason that this matters is because good workss are connected with life journeys, such as the struggles. And good challenges can produce strong viewpoints, such as the following concern of Barbara which is special for entrepreneurs: 

> *"Interestingly, when I began researching materials on report writing, I discovered that while there were an enormous number of books on how to write better sentences and paragraphs, there were no books on how to organize the thinking those sentences and paragraphs are meant to convey."* (Minto, 1996, Preface).

But what took her to help us organize thinking before communicating, had also origins from her life as a student. According to Michael's presentation, Barbara was one of the first 20 women admitted to the Harvard Business School in the late 1950s. At a time, the school was 55 years old and already regarded as a top tier. In addition, that first batch of woman went through a more traditional lecture style in a separate classroom from men. She had 10 colleagues in her special section. In addition, they told her that if they could finish in the top 10%, they would earn a spot with the men accross the river in the second year. And if that was't enough, Barbara's subject were macroeconomics. In addition, her last math class was 12th-grade math. 

When I watched that part, I had wondered about the possibilities of the extremmes. One that drops everything, or, the smart man that goes with the battles of the day, perhaps those would be the man of Harvard of the time. But that wasn't Barbara. When Michael asked her "What did you do?" she told him that as she took the textbook, as she started to prepare notes, she got mad. But she had gotten mad because it was badly written, because the person that wrote the textbook was keeping her from understanding that cool topic. 

Now when I watched that part, it took me back to my own university days when I was studying Computer Science at University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. Most of us knew that things were hard, that the hardness was part of being at that place, a well-regarded top-tier university. We would never know what we would find ahead of us when the matter was to learn topics like math. We knew the amount of hours for the lectures but the unknowing of what it takes to learn - on the side - was frightening. Of course, most students and myself, had felt the thoughts of suspiction about the ways the materials were pushed but that was shut down by the credibility and authority in the space, hard professors, hard materials, hard work, not counting the very idea that we students were lazy. It was a nightmare for me. 

But back to Barbara's day, her reaction was at another level. She went further to face the battle ahead of her in a different way. According to Michael (Heavybit, 2019), she "rewrote it, line by line, paragraph by paragraph, page by page, until she could teach the basic concepts of macroeconomics to her colleagues in the section." And that is part of Barbara's journey and how she took herself into an enlightened path where she was able to crack the code of executive communication: 

> *"I worked at the Walt Disney Company for a man named Michael Eisner when he was CEO, and his deep religious conviction was that Barbara Minto had cracked the code on executive communication. He's not alone. If you go around the world and you talk to the most accomplished executive communicators, they are practicing a version of her framework called the Pyramid Principle"* Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019)

For me, as far and up to when I had found Barbara's work, I kept moving on and looking at the things written with always a viewpoint that what was is front of me was good and well-done, likely putting myself in the position of the one not able to get it, mostly focusing in the battle of myself vs. the subject, taking myself into the effort to try to assemble the puzzle, blaming myself for the tension or frustrations through the misunderstandings, but more importantly, and quite sad, generally not noticing that a lot of the struggle with texts had to do with the confusion created by whoever wrote them. 

In the next section, we will briefly go through some aspects of Barbara's The Pyramid Principle, also with the intention to get an overview about the values and a viewpoint for communication, to make a point that further investment in this direction "might change your life," as Michael would say. 

### The model for clarity 

As you will recall from the section about growth, communication needs to cause a reaction through the interactions with the various stakeholders, such as cofounders, customers, and anyone else that we think can support the path of growth. On the other hand, you will also recall of the potential problem of overfocusing in what seems to be the rational parts, such as constructing things, picking up data, collecting proofs, looking for the supporting points of a communication, which may even involve the construction of systems, prototypes, and more. Because the sky is the limit, so let's call these thinds as "the data," althought these are generally arguments, reasons.   

Now, if the team favors "the data," still does not mean that the interaction with these roles will be more effective. As an example, imagine a team that assembles a prototype that is compelling to who they think are their customers. Now, even if some customers like it, it still does not solve the needs of communication of an investor, as these can also be interested in the business model, in the growth potential of the business, and the risks involved, if the team can productize the real version, and the like. In addition, if a team is all about the construction of proofs, would it be that they are in it to also prove to the investor? Probably not, as it is fair to assume - from the startup situation - that they are mainly focusing in "the data" as an argument, as reasons. Thus, as far as the communication with the investor goes, it is fair to think that what they have is a poor communication with the good data. Or, to look from an optimistic angle, a better communication because it has supporting data. 

Now as far as communication goes, the favor to the data, or reason and arguments, will likely set the situation of a communicative experience as a sort of gambling with the data, in the hope that the audience will get. Again, the investor's concern might be on the risks. A thought from Peter Drucker helps us to set the focus on what matters when it comes to communicative experiences, where the team has to use communication to achieve clarity and where communication only exists when it is perceived:

> *"There is a very old saying among writers: 'Difficulties with a sentence always mean confused thinking. It is not the sentence that needs straightening out, it is the thought behind it. In writing we attempt, of course, to communicate with ourselves. An unclear sentence is one that exceeds our own capacity for perception. Working on the sentence, that is, working on what is normally called communications, cannot solve the problem. We have to work on our own concepts first to be able to understand what we are trying to say - and only then can we write the sentence."* (Drucker, 2011, p. 6)

Drucker's observation reminds us that we shouldn't be trying to be fixing the words, like sentences, and paragraphs, to solve the problem. On the other hand, the problem is really the problem of perception which requires us to fully embrace the presence of the audience, the realization that the communicative experience exists so that the audience will be there for a reason as in "Why I am here?"


#### Barbara's SCqA and why are we here 

What is ahead is a brief overview of a key aspect in Barbara's work, that starts with honoring the reason for the audience to be there as we ask them to listen to a communicative experience. It's the fundamental unit of coherence in a communicative experience such as a presentation to an investor, a proposal to a partner, an offering to the a customer, and the like. 

Let's consider Barbara's SCqA, which stands for situation, complication, question, and answer.

##### Situation 

> "The best executive communication starts with the state of affairs. It's fact based, unambiguous. It's totally not controversial. No matter what side of an issue or a hard choice you're on, you should be able to read the situation and go, 'That pretty much sums it up.' Whether you're on one side or another of an issue, it doesn't matter. You should read the situation and agree to it."  Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

##### Complication 

> "The next thing that comes out is the complication. A crisp, short statement about what has changed or what's making things harder. What's changed, what's making things harder? The question, the 'Q' falls automatically out of 'S' and 'C' and it's almost always 'What should we do?' You can save yourself a lot of anxiety if you're trying to practice this, if you get hung up on 'Q' it's almost always, 'What should we do?' 'Answer,' 'A,' answer first at the top of a pyramid." Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

##### Question and Answer 

> *"Pyramid-shape your evidence underneath it, and it has to resolve the complication 100 %. She is rigorously devoted to this framework. If you go ahead and buy that book, which I recommend you do, and you read it you're going to get halfway into it and go, "She really believes this." I'm here to tell you, she really believes this. Every conversation in her life is an opportunity to SCQA. Friends, loved ones, pets, conversations at the deli counter, everything." Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

> *"You see "Answer," and then the second row. Those might be why my answer is right, they might be "How" arguments to implement the answer. But they're bolstering the answer. I want to show you an example. Underneath each of those bolstering arguments is the evidence ."* Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

By engaging in trying to come up with a coherent communiation that honors SCqA, you set yourself to to make the communication respond to the audience's potential interest and in a way that you are required to achieve clarity. In other words, by acknowledging their duty, to respond to the audience's demand such as "why are we here?," we have to face our duty to use "logic in writing, thinking and problem solving" as the subtitle of Barbara's book indicates. 

#### The power lies of directeness 

To give you a real example, I had the chance to help a friend that needed to present himself better in a hiring process. He was applying for a software engineering position, believed that he was great but didn't had all the requirements, skills in a given area. When he approached me assking for help, SCqA gave me a direction in terms of what to do, immediately, as opposed to that weird situation where I would be reading his résumé trying to guess what to do as if I had to make a drawing in a blank piece of paper, lost if not going in arbitrary directions, such as asking him to fix one or other part. No, I sort of knew what to do. Right away I made a quick meeting with him and explained to him that his résumé had to start with something that the hiring manager would agree and understand. Now, as the SCqA would prompt us to offer Roberto as a result, the answer, to the audience, the method had positioned ourselves to be concerned with a the question to the audience as being "Should I hire Roberto?" And we also felt an idea to deal with that area of his apparent weakeness with a given skill, which was also a fact - no one would deny. Therfore with situation A being that Roberto had all the skills, and situation B being that Roberto had a lacking skill, the complication that we came up, quite fast to be honest and not suffering, had recognized the line of thinking of: is that missing skill a real problem. And following along, and respecting the audience in mind, we realized that the audience would likely wonder, in case Roberto were able to work on that skill, if he really wanted to do that. It turned out that the missing skill was an area that Roberto had an interest, and was even engaged in a course already. To the setting allowed us to address in the introduction the situation of "While I do not fulfil the skill, I am already workng on that," and if that wasn't enoough we even discussed the point, for a cover letter, where had indicated that skills will come and go but the willingness to learn is key. Now, at the end of our work, we also had the feeling that in case he would come to be invited to a conference, that the same seamless mechanism, direction by SCqA, would and could be used by Roberto to have more straight answers. If even joked that a busy HR person would more be happy to feel the logic in the communication and less judging the data given. Some weeks later Roberto had reported he passed and that it was a lot due to the method. Of course I sort of sensed but a humble thiking came along to respect that he was the actual value in all. Then I was invited to a party in his place before he had to move to another city, and in that party, a bit drunk, he told his friends that the method also helped him to give a good and clear answer in the interview. He gave me some of the credits but the real thanks went to Barbara Minto. That experience goes along with the line of "it might change your life" given by Michael Dearing.  

### Do it responsibly 

The celebration that writing is not manipulative does justice first to the team, their time, and invites us to the structured and logical work of Barbara which gives to people an easier and structured way to deal with communication. Her approach is can be especially life-changing for entrepreneurs as they depend, interact, and need support from solutions-oriented audiences.  

Pehaps we can learn with them. Of course, not with the goal of tricking our audiences, with a goal of selling to them as a salesman that lies. But learn that the direction to persuade can have a holistic intention - can involve indeed the who are they, why what might want, why are they here, what is changing, and the solution with the supporting aspects.
