# Stop impressing

In this chapter, we will consider the human instinct of trying to impress and the importance of being aware of when uauthentic communication that prevents prevents the truth-seeking mentality and opportunities from real human connection.

Is he trying to impress? He seems pedantic, doesn't he? These are not generally thoughts in the mind of a business audience. Especially when the audience is hungry, in the heat of the hour, an impressive delivery comes right on, sizzling, and is generally swallowed, well done. In other terms, the awareness for "trying to impress" is digested later as we happen to be too busy - being impressed - but not as busy to consider what has happened only in retrospect after shit hits the fan. 

Althought we generally understand as negative the idea of trying to impress, when the matter is doing business, the movement of engaging with being impressive, or causing an impression, comes to existance swiftly and can be difficult to detect. The variations of that behavior are more like the a style that one can get involved with - perhaps without even noticing - as it is generally taken as a language that should be used by the professional in the field. Thus, when things are urgent, we might just do it, as if it is a language - a style - that is necessary. And then it is materialized as an improvement of the communication, we improve the style, and it may show the signs of us being in a comfort zone and in need to control the results, such as to perform better. In other words, it is complicated as it is a welcoming practive, although it does harm.  

Let us look at how this style of communication comes in our ways, how we experience it and got used to it, then to consider and reflect about the aspects that especially for entrepreneurs, how the language creates confusion in the path of discovery that demands the truth seeking mentality and how it reduces opportunities in all conversations, losing ties with deep human connection that is it a must and otherwise can foster a toxic culture. 

## Fits the norm but no feedback 

It's a language like a grease for scalability? And projects authority? the unending conversation allows room for everyone to participate, to start collaborating. But the professionalization of the communication gained a place, defined the rules more than the opportunity for what is being discussed. Footnote: This idea of the unending conversation that anyone can chime in was brought by Walter Fisher in Human Communication as Narration. Meaning, an intern can jump into a meeting of surgeons, and somehow contribute to parts of it. Especially when he or she fits the protocol. This enables scalability so that lawyers can be young minds working for them, like arms and legs, if not doing a lot of the core work so that a doctor in the boss position, of responsibility, can sign and review. 

> "What I realized was that most executives in America don't write what appears over their signature or what they say in their speeches. They have surrendered the qualities that make them unique." (Zinsser, 2006, p.176)

Indeed - because finding a letter, for instance from a school principal, and not finding the principal's identity in it, has become normal. It's as if we are somehow collaborators in this way of acting - we accept the fact when we are the reader, the audience; and often we collaborate with this culture or system that eliminates the personal side, that makes everything more pasteurized or canned.

How many letters or memos from presidents are edited by their executive secretaries, experts at ensuring that the executive's words stop being personal and become the voice of the company, a voice that must adapt to the myriad other preferences on the urgent business agenda? This process transforms the text, which might have once had a hint of the president's DNA, but no longer, once it goes through this executive 'printer.'

This state of affairs has come about precisely because these multiple agendas attack simultaneously. The secretary knows what they have to do when they edit the president's texts - they were hired to modify, or adapt, to ensure a certain 'quality.' Perhaps this vision of 'quality' helps us explain, or understand, the 'wonder' that the business world has achieved.

We are constantly adapting - our speech, our clothes, our gait, our behavior.

Executives, directors, teachers, secretaries, apprentices - whoever it may be - are adapting, are there to fit, to a world that spins like a non-stop ferris wheel. You look at that ferris wheel and you see only it's beautiful spin, and happy participants in it. No way to see that the wheel could stop, the park could end. When the wheel spins, we want to be somebody, part of that machinery that works, to a certain extent - which is unfortunately not enough for the entrepreneur who has a critical agenda, one that involves breaking rules, raising the bar, stepping outside the norm, thinking outside the box.

Thus, innovation demands alignment with identity and authenticity above all. The entrepreneur who mindlessly attempts to conform, to stop being who they are, becomes just another part of the machine. In this state, it's highly likely they are not truly innovating. Entrepreneurship doesn't start with conformity because the existing world is already in harmony; it doesn't need another supplier. Even a simplistic idea of fitting in, like "offering the same product at half the price," which theoretically has great chances of finding an audience, still carries an element of nonconformity - the half price.

The relentless pursuit of fitting into the norm has a guaranteed result, which is the lack of creativity, an antidote to entrepreneurship and innovation.

Impressing others, or the attempt to impress, sadly isn't an idea that says "I'm going to break away from the norm" or "I am here to listen," or "I am here to collect feedback." This idea shifts the focus. The self-promotion is, in essence, mediocre, as it advocates for behaving in a predefined way, what is taken as expected. In this vein, an entrepreneur does not feel lost, as in vulnerable, he or she, while doing, might be an actor as in a sort of know-it-all which in turn resets the tone. The presence of the know-it-all does not invite a discussion for what is next, such as to receive critical feedback. Thus it is, from the simpler way of seeing, a waste of time and it turns interactions, which may happen a lot in the journey, as wasting time, thus reducing the chances for success, for discovering, coming across insights, receiving advice. In other words, prevents learning.

## Appears actionable but hides truths 

In this sense, the serious entrepreneur, not overly desperate to conform, understands the importance of remaining genuine, authentic, and seeking harmony between themselves, their business, and the external environment. The responsibility to ensure their actions and those of their team members are aligned with these values falls solely on them because they are in command. This responsibility can't be outsourced but it can, and should, foster a positive culture.

Jason Child had the chance to work directly with Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, and pointed the unique of Bezos to avoid receiving information intended to please him: 

> "Jeff Bezos had a very strong point of view that as the CEO every one of his direct reports has a bias to want to please him and so therefore the analysis of the metrics they show are going to try to show that they're doing a great job and so Jeff is famous for a couple things one of the things is he optimizes not for a cohesive culture but a truth seeking culture." (Child, 2023, 14:49)

<!-- https://youtu.be/A9MqV4ULMuM?t=889 --> 

This skepticism was illustrated by Jason in the case of presentations of the finance department: When a presentation was given, and whether it was too good or bad, Bezos would ask to double-check the data. 

As can be seen, the issue of impressing others enters various settings and is deeply embedded in corporate culture and in life in general. The figures need to be attractive, the stories need to be well told, and conformity masked as quality is omnipresent. Perhaps, if it weren't for Amazon's strong culture, present from the very beginning, Amazon wouldn't exist today as we know it. In this sense, Amazon's culture exemplifies the search for truths and this resonates with the idea here of not wanting to impress.

This discussion emphasizes the importance of remaining authentic and genuine, rather than merely trying to impress.

## Standards-compliant but disconnected from humans 

The thing for trying to impress might be present in the human in a way or another, as a behavior to control results, managed naturally or even not consciously as we can be anxious in front of situations where judgement might be involved (directly or unconsciously. ) In a way, we can't get rid from engaging in this mode, when we are writing, making a presentation, talking with a customer, colleagues, investors. Breaking from this mode should be considered, as it is important to focus in the authentic, to that it puts us in a position to learn faster, to being unique, 

The attack, or outbreak, or need to impress can appear under various conditions but necessarily involves a receiver, an audience. But regardless of the audience or the medium, the entrepreneur can engage in this behavior automatically. Thus, the action of impressing, or trying to impress, materializes in writing, in face-to-face communication (1:1), in meeting presentations (1:n), in speeches, etc.

Let us consider a case from On Writing Well, of a letter written by a school principal to parents: 

> "In the school year ahead we week to provide enhanced positive learning environments. Children, and staff, must work in an atmosphere that is conducive to learning. Wide varieties of instructional materials are needed. Careful attention to individual abilities and learning styles is required. " (Zinsser, 2006, p.176)

In reviewing the letter, William asked how "enhanced positive learning environments," was different from "an atmosphere that is conductive to learning." He went along and urged the school team to drop that kind of language and use a language that parents would actually be listening, participating. 

But where does this need come from? Or even, this victimization? The phenomenon has become so entrenched in the work environment that perhaps people are no longer aware when they simply enter the game of trying to impress. To say that it's a game is an interesting articulation because it turns out that many times we do it not because we really want to, but in fact we accept the rules of the game, or we dance to the music. In this sense, the action of entering "impression mode" becomes mediocre because it is firstly a cliché, or it suggests the comfortable action of playing the same mediocre beat of the ambient music - it leads to jargon, it leads to the standard, it leads to disconnection with the audience and it does not elevate. 

The situation, which could be one of learning, which could be relevant to the individuals in the scene, becomes not only a pastime, but worse, a toxic pastime - even more so when everyone is there doing the same thing, just trying to impress; without honest, genuine agendas.

But leaving, or getting out of this mode is difficult, because precisely the environment around us conditions us - everyone participates together. Thus, it is important for us to detect and identify the "impress" mode - an art that requires patience, observation and reflection. That is, it is counterintuitive because the urgent world asks for an entrepreneur can't pause to reflect or think as things go; and is likely to be acting just like the people around.

## Courage for enlightment  

### From survival to enlightment 

If we entirely drop the idea of trying to impress, it won't give really anything actionable to the entrepreneur, assuming the entrepreneur is to be working in being an infinite apprendice. Thus, if we want to support ourselves, we need to recognize the degree where trying to impress is natural, or where it comes from. And, with that, to consider what comes after, the space of opportunity if it exists. 

Thus, with the above cases presented, we come to terms in a calmer place where we can recognize that we engage with trying to impress to feel safe. Consider the Maslow Pyramid, or looking through the pyramid, as a tool to see the situation-complication which can help us see that any effort of communication of that nature might go along with a need, a basic need, such to perform as what is being expected, such as trying to fit a norm, such as to secure survival within the circumstances. 

As in one that holds to the cliché as a device so that their stories can stand. Therefore, it can be more or less conscious but it seems valid to assume that it has todo with securing benefits in the sense of being safe in the eyes of a space or audience where we would otherwise be uncomfortable, and not be adequate, thus lose the opportunity to fit. 

In the interview by the Indie Film Hustle, McKee pinpoints two critical traps that new screenwriters often fall into when crafting their narratives. The first is their reliance on clichés. While they aim to create original art, they also understand that they cannot entirely reinvent the wheel. The reliance on clichés, however, leads to a phenomenon where "once they sell their soul, it's hard to get it back" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 10:36). McKee also points a related concern where the writer fails the writer's duty of expressing the truth of the human condition. Or, as he puts it, "they think that because it is fiction, they have a license to lie" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 12:02). He warns of the perils of resorting to clichés and of losing one's authentic voice in an attempt to please the audience. As McKee puts it, "Of all those things, cliches and [lack of] truthfulness, are all the byproduct of the young writer's desire to please" (Indie Film Hustle, 2021, 13:08). 

Robert's advice for new screenwriters is equally great to our entrepreneurial world. The desires to please and to avoid risk can push us into a path that deviates from our own vision or any other opportunity ahead. 

This notion, of what is next, aligs with the englighted spot of Maslow's pyramid. Just like the being that feels safe is better positioned towards being enlighted, to transcend the realities of being safe, the opportunity lies first in recognizing that being safe is a precondition to escaping safety. And that we can be trapped into the zone of safety, it is a human tendency that can be a wall in front of the opportunity to grow, towards our enlighted being, and how that is a door to real opportunities. 

### Facing the enemy is being vulnerable 

The situation - of leadership - was shown by William Zinsser was of a school from Greenwich, Connecticut, that invited him to dejargonize themselvs, as they concluded that they would be unable to help students to write if they kept writing as they were. William first recognized that the school principals made themselves vulnerable [^footnote_william_zinsser_vulnerability] as a major strenght. 

[^footnote_william_zinsser_vulnerability]:  William Zinsser has noted a sign of leadership from the school principals, as "vulnerability has a strength of it's own. " (Zinsser, 2006, p. 168) and that soon he has received a package with lots of memos, and letters, and more, from the set of 16 elementary, junior and senior high schools. 

William saw the opportunity to help them. But William's move was not as simple as "give up your jargon" sort of mentality, not William style which would be like a cliché being used to promote dropping cliché. The approach of William was precisely asking for the school to connect with their human side, to drop the language that was not connecting with parents, a "suffocating language," and go back to be natural. 

> *I told the principals that we want to think of the man and woman who run our children's schools as people not unlike ourselves. We are suspicious of pretentiousness, of all the fat words that the social scientists have coined to avoid making themselves clear to ordinary mortals. I urged them to be natural. How we write and how we talk is how we define ourselves."* (Zinsser, 2006, p. 166).

facing battle - Zinsser, p. 172, has shown the situation when the principals have engaged with the battle, reviewing their writings, "they have met the enemy for the first time. They scribbled on their pads and scratch it out what they had scribbled. Some didn't write anything. Some crumpled their paper. They began to look like writers." P.172

* examples of corrections: "evaluative procedures for the objectives were also established based on acceptable criteria," became options like "at the end of the year we will evaluate our progress. " or "we will see how we will have succeeded. " p 172

## Stop being impressed

Existe ainda um outro lado que é quando ficamos impressionados, diferente de tentarmos impressionar mas existe uma relação. Essa situação é também típica também.

O empreendedor Glen, da Redfin, ilustra o assunto na questão da interação entre o membro do conselho e o empreendedor.

(Pegar a paráfrase abaixo
https://youtu.be/ivZQfGVN1pY?t=1087 )

Ele diz (checar) que quando foi montar seu conselho ele se encontrou com essas pessoas super famosas, importantes, que haviam tido sucesso anterior. E que nessas horas ele deixou de ser quem ele era, ficou impressionado, sem fala, em um estado de paralisia. Essa pressão é normal, é do ser humano (checar isso em coisas de psicologia) mas é criticamente importante porque a última coisa que o empreendedor deve fazer é entrar na seara do aham, concordar por exemplo, com aquilo que foi dito, só porque foi dito por alguém importante.

O exemplo da história do Salman Kahn, narrado de forma hilariante pelo próprio, caracteriza a situação no cenário extremo, pois um belo dia o Salman recebeu uma noticia que Bill Gates usava seu site (Kahn Academy) para ensinar seus filhos e que o Bill havia mencionado a importante do site em público  Após isso, eventualmente o encontro aconteceu - o pessoal de Bill Gates convidou o Salman para um encontro e chegando lá o Salman ficou travado, oras esse é o Bill Gates na minha frente? Você é o Bill Gates? (Checar os detalhes engraçados e reais dessa história).
