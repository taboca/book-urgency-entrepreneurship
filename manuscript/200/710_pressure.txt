Introduction

We often find ourselves under pressure, whether it's derived from internal or external factors. How we handle this pressure can be a decisive factor between victory and defeat. A recent lesson reveals that at times, wrongly applied pressure can steer us off the real path to achieve our goals.

On a maritime journey, a commander and his sailor sons face the challenge of maintaining their course and reaching their destination. The commander, impatient with the lack of progress, opts for an aggressive approach: he throws one of the sailor's luggage into the sea, hoping to ignite a reaction. However, despite his drastic action, the boat doesn't speed up.

In desperation, the commander decides to step back temporarily, leaving the sailors on their own. This forces the sailors to adapt and find new strategies to move the boat forward. They realize that the beauty of the boat, which until then was not being capitalized on, could be a great attraction. The sails are raised, displaying their beauty to anyone in sight, and soon the boat is moving again, this time at a much faster pace.

So, is pressure a futile tool when it comes to achieving our goals? Not necessarily. Pressure can be a powerful driving force, but it must be strategically applied and aimed at the right goal. Focusing too much on secondary issues can blind us to the true strategic action that needs to be taken.

The Role of Context and True Strategic Action

The first lesson drawn from this story is the importance of understanding the context. In the case of the boat, it was necessary for sailors and the commander to identify the mission of the context - what really mattered for the progress of the boat. This involved setting aside their own desires and focusing on what benefitted the boat as a whole. The true strategic action emerges when we recognize the objective of the context and identify the necessary actions to achieve it.

Identification of Key Results and Actions

The second pillar for successful navigation is identifying key results and corresponding actions. In this regard, a pressure system can be effective. When the sailors knew that their actions would have a direct and expected impact on the journey, they put in more effort. Pressure, in this case, served as a stimulus for the execution of strategic actions.

Evaluation and Observation

Lastly, it's not enough to just identify and carry out strategic actions; it's also necessary to evaluate their results. Not every well-intentioned strategy leads to positive results, and that's where evaluation comes in. The commander's story illustrates this truth. His initial strategy of throwing the luggage into the sea didn't have the expected result, but the consequence of this act - his temporary withdrawal - allowed for a new strategy to be formed.

Conclusion

In summary, pressure is a valuable tool when used correctly. It's essential to understand the context, identify key actions and results, and finally, evaluate and adjust strategies as needed. In the heat of the moment, it's easy to get carried away by urgency and forget about strategy. This lesson applies not just to sailors or commanders, but to all of us because those who act under pressure might end up prioritizing urgency over strategy, leading to significant losses. So, remember to take a step back, assess the situation, and act strategically.
