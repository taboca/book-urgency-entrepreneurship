Balance Theory: This theory, proposed by Fritz Heider, is based on the idea of cognitive consistency, or a balance of relations. In the case of a salesperson-customer relationship, if there's an imbalance, such as a change in control dynamics, it creates an uncomfortable state. The salesperson may feel threatened or undermined when the customer presents information that challenges their authority or control over the situation, which can lead to a breakdown in the interaction.

Self-Perception Theory: Introduced by Daryl Bem, it suggests that people develop their attitudes by observing their own behavior and concluding what attitudes must have caused it. A salesperson might perceive themselves as experts and authoritative figures. When this is challenged, it could alter their self-perception and trigger defensive behavior.

There are a multitude of programs or services designed to support entrepreneurs on their journey. Nowadays, these are accessible through platforms, apps, messaging groups, and participation programs, whether online or in person. These platforms create "interactive stages" where entrepreneurs "enter the game" by signing up. In these settings, some advance to the next stage while many do not. Advancing does not guarantee winning the "real game" of a startup's life in the market. Those who do not advance may see this as a sign of failure. However, anything can happen. It's worth recalling a notable quote from Brian Chesky during Blitzscaling 3: if your idea is good, everyone will ignore it.

Entrepreneurs must be responsible, and conscious, and capable, of the navigation in a world of narratives given by this networked, interactive, animated, happy, gamified, environment. A basic tip is to be cautious of anything that looks like a shortcut. Beware of urgent agendas, super opportunities, plug-and-play solutions, and opportunities for fragmented appearances. These interactive experiences often carry a parallel narrative, noticeable due to their orchestrated commonality. Regardless of their nature, these events now typically feature people taking photos, comments being indexed by hashtags on social media, and mentors coordinating the beat of the music, the timing of parties and pizzas – the whole enchilada.

However, the critical issue is that everything is an interaction. Entrepreneurs need to focus on constructive interactions that resonate with their projects; not to join just for the sake of joining, nor to be dazzled by the beat of the drums. Everything now comes with catchy music and a community full of enthusiasm. Therefore, seek events and situations more aligned with your goals, more open to debate, etc. Beware of the show, even if it's live, as many of them are pre-formatted and not necessarily designed to benefit your agenda.

The challenge is complex because there is quality content within these mediums. More and more incredible works are being created, and knowledge and good ideas are becoming increasingly rich resources, even in films or shows. Furthermore, new forms of narratives are being created all the time, narratives that introduce increasingly better participatory systems. Yet, in the face of an abundance of relevant information and contagious enthusiasm, teams should pause to consider how they are "joining the dance" and how the activities actually contribute to their objectives and projects. It's complex because the science and art of entrepreneurship work best for those who are learners. How can a participant in a program, already signed up and needing to listen and advance, also know how to judge and evaluate? Through external perspectives and reflections, always. Permission for this must exist. Let's explore some situations that can motivate us regarding the dynamics involved when participants engage in these programs.

If a stage entrepreneurship program were just a presentation of ideas and emotions, the entrepreneur could treat it like a movie or a book, reflecting on what was seen. But the problem with on-stage interaction is, above all, that it directly involves the identity of the people on stage. We're not mere spectators; we're in the midst of it all, and it will influence us in some way.

A point for reflection begins with understanding the other side of the show: that the show doesn't necessarily work for the entrepreneur. The entrepreneur works for the show because the show has a format and a script. Yes, it's interactive. But there's a specific place to sit and almost a cue to applaud. The show requires the entrepreneur to fit into its format. While learning elements are duly inserted—because every show needs an atmosphere that resonates with the audience—the essence of the show lies in the coordination of a narrative where emotions and dialogues attract the spectator, including entrepreneurial spectators, judge spectators, mentor spectators, among others.

The entrepreneur-as-spectator will start to view everything through a limited lens because the camera is not the eye of life—for example, the life of the venture—it's the view of the show, like the camera in a movie. A perspective from that corner, the lime light at the right moment. It needs to be this way because if it were more about life as it is, the show would be too boring, the program wouldn't work. The program needs, at a minimum, a pragmatic model. Something that can lead somewhere. And this nature is already a system of observers that will influence the project, much like in the quantum world.

So, in the show's agenda, there's a dilemma—the enchantment of the story or the elements of real life. Another articulation, less cinematic but still living from the same dilemma, is journalism that documents the world. As they say—the story is told by the victors. But we can openly discuss this phenomenon now and create a distinction—understanding that one does not learn entrepreneurship from TV shows, movies, sensational articles, and most of the fragmented stories that appear before us every day.

However, it's not entirely fair to say this; since cinema, for example, is an art that continues to impress us. Special movies convey special messages, about principles, for example—life stories that teach us. Certain special films can put us in a reflective state, about our attitudes, our behaviors.

But what's dangerous is not realizing that many other stories are being told by experienced people who have learned the art of storytelling. So, we have many more artists, and they're not just making fiction books, films, theater, and music anymore. The new artists mastering the narrative art are active in all areas, writing journalistic articles and creating narratives about entrepreneurship as well. It's an art, and you as an entrepreneur need to be aware that this art is activated on your side. At the very least, be aware and only then should you navigate by subscribing to information channels from the world.

“So here's a tip—understand how stories are made.”

Let's then navigate through situations subject to the stage or stage narrative since professionals in the world of storytelling and narratives are active in all areas.

One of them is the reality show. Danger #1.

Because they are even more urgent. In a reality show's agenda, a screenwriting coordinator is constantly striving to keep the viewer engaged. And how does he do that? With his gaze not on knowledge or the truths of entrepreneurship, assuming reality shows about entrepreneurship. The focus is on the alternation of states, from negative to positive; on the construction of mini journeys, the one who worked, who suffered, and conquered, is deserving. Or the return of the one who was evil and discovered new potential. Everything depends on context, in real life, but in the urgent agenda of the show for audiences, the construction doesn't run with the entrepreneur's context. It's more of a cultural contest looking for reasons to eliminate people and only has a limited view if the story being told was cool. A particular situation caught my attention.

I was told about a competition between two teams, where everyone was a blogger. The teams were tasked with selling a product on the street. One decided to set up a stall and sell products to passersby. The other team did something different—they took advantage of the fact that they were famous bloggers and one of them made a call on their blog channel, simply asking people from their audience to visit their stall on Avenida Paulista and buy products.

Unsurprisingly, they made much more money than the team that decided not to go online. Hence, this story, in the show, somehow worked very well. It's likely that members of the other team, being bloggers themselves, were left wondering—why didn't we think of that? But this perspective, or this doubt, is a doubt that only appears after the other team won the stage. And the other team won because no one from the production reminded that using their internet channels was a rule that would disqualify, or simply because the director chose this movement, this scene, this event, as the turning point.

Now, imagine if the same exercise were done again—now that everyone knows that speaking on the internet is valid. Naturally, all teams would try something like that, simply speaking on their blogs. Then would that first team, theoretically more creative, be able to make a pool to pay for a billboard with their own money or pay for TV advertising? You see, what the first team did could be seen as playing dirty. Because whoever blogged used their prior investment and perhaps even exploited their audience. But it might also not be seen as dirty, in the case of TV, because the rule wasn't determined. So, it ended up being creative.

Similarly, if someone used 50,000 reais to bring people to the location and literally paid people to pay them, then it would be unfair, right? So, how far can you manipulate? The question, in the show, was beautifully portrayed; the perspective was established, the director chose the moments. Worse, the director had to choose within the time he had. The winning team was not seen as the one that exploited—they won, and the other team had to look for someone to "fire."

You might think this occurs in major programs like "Reality Show," but we must remember there are stages and dynamics, and the issue of authority and power is also at play on the side of the coordination system.

But in real life, if all of that were truly entrepreneurship, what actually happened there? Would that stall that decided on the online campaign be the true, more enduring solution? Let's say, then, that both teams could video blog at will, but now the exercise is not for 1 day—let's say it's for 1 year. Then both would probably blog and invite everyone, but the wave would disappear in a few days. And afterward, video blogging wouldn't have the same effect, and they would indeed be in the valley of sadness, or in the true valley of entrepreneurship. Welcome to the sinking ship unless you do something real. Assuming from this perspective, of long-term entrepreneurship, that show—as a gimmick at the moment—would no longer work, and maybe another team, which hadn't even spent time blogging, could be the team that was actually gaining time.

So, the conclusion we come to here is that there are simply forces at play when teams enroll in programs. And that many of the systems create systems of validation and elimination that naturally force teams to achieve results, advance, with an urgent agenda that somehow finds heroes with the goal of winning the stage. But let it be clear in our minds, it's just a stage. And many of the dynamics of the stage itself may be good reasons not to do it. It's very important to identify the objective of the dynamic. It would be great if we had time to read this, to check.

## Through platforms 

The narrative agenda doesn't just apply to ready-made products for audiences like books, movies, series, and reality shows. The power of narrative is also an active agenda in situations where entrepreneurs interact, competing or collaborating, with the goal of achieving objectives.

Thus, a public or shared agenda typically governs events such as cultural contests, championships, acceleration programs, among others.

We shouldn't use this analysis to make the mistake of not recognizing the positive aspects of these programs. This is because they do advance certain aspects, as they create a collaborative environment to select the best and eliminate the worst. The organizers bear responsibility and invest a lot of time in designing the elimination program, defining much more than the prizes that represent the gateway to another later stage; but all the necessary equipment like theme, rules, judges, mentors, etc. All this is not the problem. The complication is, again, a system, an agenda, a framework, a dynamic, and the acting powers.

But this does not prevent that, during the moment of participation and the agenda of the elimination program, the teams enter a treadmill where attention is taken by new forces. And it makes total sense, these forces mean that the entrepreneur is there to learn and is learning. It makes sense because it's focus. But the complication arises precisely when the identities of the entrepreneurs connect too much with the focus of the program, putting execution at risk.

According to Wikipedia, Startup Weekend is a 54-hour event that brings together developers, business managers, enthusiasts, marketing gurus, graphic artists, and others who form teams to compete and present their pitches based on their startup ideas. This example illustrates how such events are designed to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship but also highlight the inherent challenges in balancing the competitive and educational aspects of these programs. The focus on winning can sometimes overshadow the learning process, making it crucial for participants to maintain a balance between taking advantage of the opportunities these platforms offer and not losing sight of their entrepreneurial journey and objectives.

> “Startup Weekend is a 54-hour weekend event, during which groups of developers, business managers, startup enthusiasts, marketing gurus, graphic artists and more pitch ideas for new startup companies, form teams around those ideas, and work to develop a working prototype, demo, or presentation by Sunday evening.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_Weekend

Should we penalize elimination systems because they perform their function well? No. It's not their fault that the system acts like a kind of launchpad—ultimately propelling, even if only temporarily, the efforts of some entrepreneurs. However, in the entrepreneur's context, it's crucial to understand that the event's narrative isn't the team's narrative, which should transcend the program's limits. The narrative about the event is typically governed by forces such as theme, criteria, mentors, judges, etc. With this level of awareness, entrepreneurs should not view the event as a validation of their idea in the world but as an opportunity to learn. For those who make it through the selection, this approach is already halfway there—the participants are already in the realm of pivoting and learning.

What can be dangerous is the realm of the winners, according to the criteria and context of the event they participated in. This situation presents the problem of validation, of living with a story that has been "validated" by the event. Entrepreneurs should recognize that a single validation may not hold value in the face of the eventual business agenda; this is because the entrepreneur's context is more significant in the long term. Therefore, it's important to accept the prize without concluding that one acceleration or elimination system had the means to determine if your idea and startup have a chance in the world. This is a problem of false positives, which is not confined to competition-type events. Even the most renowned investment firms in the world constantly worry because there is no formula that dictates which startup will be the next big disruption.

Consider the perspective of young Moreira Sanine on his many (10) participations in Startup Weekend; it's interesting because he saw his participation as a learning opportunity and recommends that participants approach with a broader view. According to Sany-sany, participating in these events makes sense if you are true to yourself. Live your life, not the lives of others.


> “Last weekend a friend and I discussed this topic for hours! He’s sent over 50 letters for a vacant job, but always without success. Although his last one lead him to a double interview (good perspective) unfortunately without success. Like my friend, there are many people who give up to easily. They make excuses over excuses and they don’t give up on creating new excuses! One of my all time favorite talk is the brilliant Larry Smith’s TED talk on why you will fail to have a great career. Larry’s point sais it all; To rid yourself of fear. To not hold back. To experience the kind of experience you wish to have to the FULLEST! Ultimately, it’s about being yourself. Follow your passion means exactly that. Live your life, not someone else’s. Because your own feelings are your ultimate truth. If you betray your own feelings for what the world tells you, then you betray yourself.” https://medium.com/@sany_sany/embrace-the-startup-weekend-failure-s-e572c9a7841b

### Unmasking the Control Dynamics 

In the entrepreneurial world, founders and startups are not immune to these dynamics. From purchasing services to engaging in accelerator programs, every interaction is a transaction. Here, the balance between analytical engagement and deference to perceived authority is vital. Even in settings designed for mutual learning and collaboration, like accelerators, the pressure to maintain the norm and authority sometimes overrides the need for an open dialogue.

Consider a situation in an accelerator program where a query about a written exercise is dismissed, maintaining the norm and authority but ignoring the genuine need for clarity. The reaction, though later appreciated privately, depicts a trend of public conformity that contradicts the spirit of such programs.

It's clear that both the protagonists of a transaction - service providers or salespersons - and users or customers, are struggling to find their footing in this new digital world. These digital systems can be confusing, leading to conflicts in situations that used to be straightforward.

As entrepreneurs, it is crucial to understand and navigate these dynamics effectively. The transformation isn't about winners or losers but adapting to a new playing field where both the customer and salesperson wear multiple hats. The challenge lies in balancing the scales of power and control, learning to be both a participant and an observer in this new transactional world.

In this race against time, it's essential to remember that our interest in establishing the judgement of the protagonists isn't as simple as giving time for reflection, which comes from slowing down the team's participation. It's about gaining perspective, understanding the nuances beyond what is going on, establishing the view in perspective as in an expectator and using that to build healthier management system for the long run. 

### Self staging 

The worst stage is the one created by the entrepreneur themselves. When they want their story to be true, when they coordinate a narrative but don't necessarily want to look at the truths. But this seems negligible because thinking that an entrepreneur would do this seems very deliberate. The problem today is that you might not even know you're creating your own stage; you're already on it and unaware.

** We see more and more people self-qualifying their own personal achievements, and using these to drive their business and their media behind it. Instead of building a brand around a company, many are focused on building a brand around themselves, in the hope that the company will follow suit.** [The difference between Bootcamps, Incubators and Accelerators](https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/the-difference-between-bootcamps-incubators-and-accelerators-632a4d4e8bd8)

#### Success of the shelf 

Even the lives of successful entrepreneurs have been adapted and turned into products. Want to know how Steve Jobs dressed? You can. But not only the demeanor of entrepreneurs has become a product for consumption. Today, everything is a product, service, or information available in an interactive format.

The risk for the entrepreneur is the same risk faced by consumers going to the market. They begin to navigate these "shelf products" and assume they are true solutions, applicable to their reality—without a second thought or consulting another viewpoint. As a result, they consume edited, summarized, decontextualized content that was normally designed to look beautiful, to sell.

The fact is that the narratives of the products are surgically crafted as the ideal solution for the entrepreneur. The elements of idea and emotion will form the perfect "blend" for the desperate entrepreneur—and in these conditions, they run the risk of simply picking the product off the shelf thinking it makes sense for their life. Not much different from the product assault a consumer faces when visiting the market.

For example, they are bombarded with information in the form of products, such as books, apps, spreadsheets, all duly modernized with good interactivity, presenting their methodologies, their frameworks, etc. These elements can be opportunities or traps, and it's into these that the entrepreneur signs up.
