# Communication 

ChatGPT was launched, and before I could grasp its potential, I found myself using it to craft texts. I noticed that this tool becomes increasingly effective if you have in fact expertise in the field that you are interested. In a more colorful analogy, a tool like ChatGPT is like an super powerful unicorn that is not tamed. You can ride in weird ways, you can fall, or you can ride with it elegantly and fly. 

However, some insights are not tied to the technology behind the tool but to my personal experience interacting with it. The tool has taught me valuable lessons about human productivity, collaboration, and how emotions and thoughts can hinder a productive work session that would lead to quality work.

Yet, before we delve into these non-technological and natural aspects of human collaboration, I must acknowledge what led me to use ChatGPT. The driving force behind this decision was the alluring promise of potential rewards. For instance, if I communicate my wishes, the tool will deliver, much like a genie from a lamp.

My trust in ChatGPT's capabilities likely stems from my background, as I have interacted with computers since I was 10 and later pursued a degree in Computer Science. Even being somewhat "in the field," I didn't expect technology to be able to replicate what seems not much different from human reasoning, a certain form of reasoning that employs narratives. But in using it, I realized it understood my needs in a unique way - this became the gateway to deeper reflection, which in turn led me to some observations about certain human flaws, likely sparked by our rushed approach to life.

## is friendly and patient 

The concept of an elevator pitch is familiar to many entrepreneurs—you have 30 seconds to pique an investor's interest. This approach is a test that they do - a selective system - as we will be able to reflect when reading "Selecting bad investors" in part 3. But this approach to acting has spreaded as we have mechanized communications in a way. So then in the current world as we know it, we simply can't use the time of an investor and start with a line "When I was born" or any sort of deductive [^deductionsucksforcommunication]. 

[^deductionsucksforcommunication]: A sort of natural way of saying things has to do with recollecting how we learned, the deductive approach, which produces the listener to be bored and lost. A structured approach for business proposals, according to Barbara Minto in her book The Pyramid Principle, consists of structuring the introduction using Barbara's SCqA and providing supporting points in a logical order. For more, read "Invest in executive communication". 

The phenomenon is in how we operate, it's demanded in everyday communication even among your friends, or family. They likely don't have the time, or the inclination and willingness, to understand upfront the reasons that compells you to be communicating something that you didn't say which you likely are trying to convey. The way we absorb information - plus the urgency of modern life - contribute to this phenomenon. Therefore, you are left on your own. The hush and harsh reality of life will eventually teach you to try again, other time, to go back home, do your homework and try to achieve clarity of ideas, then come back and try again. This paragraph lifts up something we know, from our life cycle, as humans; that we are trying again and again. And we will have a chance, also in part 3, to look at the lean movement cycle from above. 

However, there is now this new class of assistants that came on our way - these are the AI-based chat robots that might not suffer from these constraints. They might not be in a hurry so interacting with it might be an opportunity to clarify your ideas. By feeding it with bits and pieces of your narrative, including deductive stories; by gradually making your points, you should be able to interact with it and find yourself in a way towards clarity. 

It could be the case that some people are using - or misusing - these AI robots in ways like that and are currently reporting that they are improving their lives. That the robot is listening to them. The phenomenon that leads them to put in this way might have to do with indeed their effort that was put in place, the opportunity, to iterate more. In other words, they are giving more time for themselves, writing more, putting "on paper" more. The act of putting on paper, as pointed by Julia Cameron in The Artist's Way, has therapeutic effects that can unlock the creative mind as perhaps control systems are less put in place, which resonates with the an enlightened way of living as pointed by "Maslow in Maslow on Management". 

## Is non-distracting 

ChatGPT not only structures your ideas but also provides explanations in a clear, digestible manner, which is totally different from the approach that you typed in the first place - what it friendly has accepted with an optimistic and forward-looking inclination. Additionally, its simple, ad-free interface promotes focus and understanding. In addition, its note by note, as a chat, way of moving forward, is quite compatible with a way that the human is likely to be focused. In addition, its animated approach, typing word by word as of the version 4.0, is quite friendly to people that might have more or less difficulty to follow a lot of words in the screen. 

Now, sum these features and consider the value of asking things and trying to elaborate thoughts with it, especially if you are person that is having a hard time to read online and put together the map of ideas that are working on. 

I might have my own difficulties that some may try to tag as TDAH or dislexia; but I am also feeling that the web as it has contributed to develop habits in my personal operating system. I caught myself trusting too much a habit of doing searches across sites with different layouts, with a lot of unecessary additional visual things, which creates confusion. The seamless all in one screen approach of ChatGPT is a key aspect to pay attention, it gives a more relaxing interface which gives me an opportunity to improve the amount of time in front of it. 

## Solves puzzles 

The phenomenon of creating prompts is well-acknowledged and far from being a new concept. The art and science of formulating prompts echo the larger discipline of crafting incisive questions. This subject is extensively explored. There's a famous quote by physicist Albert Einstein that encapsulates the idea:

> "If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes." Albert Einstein [^alberteinsten]

[^alberteinsten]: Albert Einstein (1879–1955), revered as one of history's most influential physicists, also engaged deeply in philosophical thought. Einstein stressed the importance of philosophical inquiry for fostering scientific creativity, advocating for a reflective approach as a cornerstone in advancing scientific knowledge.

Or you can consider books like like "A More Beautiful Question: The Power of Inquiry to Spark Breakthrough Ideas." But we can also celebrate the interest in the idea when we check how people started to query for the word "prompt" since about February of 2023 and the correlation with searches for the word "chatgpt".

One more to consider is "prompt engineering" which is a keyword that can also take you to many books or courses:

What presents a significant opportunity - perhaps even more urgent than mastering the art of prompts - is a concept I absorbed from Julia Cameron from her course-book entitled The Right to Write. Cameron structures her book as a series of "invitations," essays that explore different aspects of writing. A particular article, "Bad Writing," resonated with me.

Cameron suggests that liberating ourselves from the critic that insists on 'proper' writing can unlock our potential. Inspired, I engaged with one of her proposed exercises and encountered a profound revelation. The instant I ceased my obsession to write 'correctly,' and have accepted I could just do it, I caught myself in a space of freedom for connecting ideas, for coordinating ideas. 

The approach by Julia seemed to match with the kind of prompts I was writing for ChatGPT, which gave me the impression that I was honing the skill of creating prompts. But again, not to miss the point, I was liberated from anxieties about grammar and judgment, I found myself driven to write, accessing my thoughts more effectively and efficiently.

Intriguingly, even before I encountered Cameron's invitation, I experienced a glimpse of this phenomenon. One day, as I was motivated with the art of prompts, I have decided to write a prompt in a more relaxed and calmer way. The extra investment was not exaclty about trying to write a prompt like an article but still I was giving myself time and trying to write more properly. To my surprise I wasn't achieving only a well-crafted prompt but was surfacing the whole answer to what I was looking for. I caught myself joking "Hey, I am working for you, ChatGPT! It's you that should work for me!. " And, right after saying that, I experienced a chill coursing through my body as if my mind had been sucker-punched by a realization. "My friend, I was always here inside of you, able to write better, capable of crafting questions and even planning what is next in a proper way. You just didn't take the time to see me."

At that moment I felt I coined the "Science and Art of Writing Prompts and Not Sending it to ChatGPT" and the revelations that you will see there resonate incredibly with the so strong point from Julia Cameron. 

## and the mechanization of humans 

It's a delightful and yet ironic that ChatGPT - when seen as a tool that gives instantaneous results, in the sense of instant gratification, has shown us a door. Not a door leading to more digital intoxication, but one that opens up to our innermost values. It enables us to be patient, focused, to get into an iterative and perhaps attentive collaboration without fear, such as judgment, without distractions, without pressures such as from critics, investors, approvers, directors, teachers, you name it. The journey of progress first and foremost requires allowing the individual, the young soul, to evolve. We are all novices in various areas of life. A fitting example is writing. We sometimes feel like beginners in specific fields, and often, there's no "coach" for that. No wise elder or grandparent guiding us in a friendly manner. It's a loss. We need to reclaim this essence.

Now, if you consider for a while a human, which is in front of you and there to help with something that you want to collaborate. But consider such human as a technology. He can have a conversation with you, more humanized or not. Can be more patient or not. Can be rude or nice. Can be optimistic or not. Can motivate or not. Can be patient or not. There are situations that people compare the experience of ChatGPT with the experience of interacting with listeners such as some of the characteristics of psychologists. Yes, psychologists can listen, psychologists can offer a friendly environment, without judgement. Psychologists might be able to offer a lot of sessions, in time, so that we can achieve clarity. Now, an average human, in the work environment, under pressure, might not have an agenda for being a listerner, for example. 

In conclusion, my experience writing and collaborating with ChatGPT underscores that ideas evolves from a conversation, from positive iteration. Engaging in a friendly dialogue, such as one that holds actively listening, and continuously asking the not-yet-right questions demonstrates the power of human intuition with machine efficiency. However, the lesson isn't about the capabilities of AI, but the humanized collaborative approach inherent in us that perhaps, over time, we've overlooked or forgotten. It's a testament to how modern problem-solving can take on a dynamic, interactive form, rooted deeply in our innate human capacities.
