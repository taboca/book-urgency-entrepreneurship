## The data is around and you don't even know it

On detection, for the notion of strategic dissonance as presented by Andy Grove, employees can help, specially the ones that are "wise to their world and their environment". To detect is a subtle thing, it may come like, according to Andy, in situations such as when a leading team speaks â€” they are answering questions about strategy, and these vital employees would throw follow up questions such as "but what about... " or "does it mean... "

They are working on, sharp probing for true intentions. But then the problem is to detect, and is the role of leaders, to triage, to know. Is this just a communication problem or is this a strategic dissonance between the reality and what's being said? Is it possible to tell that there is dissonance between what is being said and what is being done? If people feel that, your company may well be living the problem.
