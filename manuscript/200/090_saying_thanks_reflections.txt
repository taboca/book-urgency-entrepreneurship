Sometimes, the act of saying thanks - to someone or a system or something in life - can turn into a deeper moment for reflection. By expressing gratitude, we revive memories that could otherwise be forgotten, giving them their due value and understanding how they have shaped us. In my journey, the process of writing the acknowledgements section for this book actually turned into a deeper dive into the experiences and lessons that have shaped my trajectory. My sincere attempt to express gratitude ended up being a journey through my personal and professional development, and from that an opportunity to talk about this expression. 






I did not know the power of the act of gratitude from a more technical nature - but I knew that there was something within me, in my operating system, that depended on the act of gratitude. The first time I encountered this phenomenon was when I wrote a letter, during my university days, to Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of the C programming language. My task was to write a paper comparing the C and Pascal programming languages. I crafted a narrative of 20 pages where the creator of the C language was exchanging ideas with the creator of Pascal. In the narrative, the C language emerged as the winner. I sent a letter to Dennis Ritchie, and he responded with gratitude. He also mentioned that the inventor of the Pascal language deserved recognition because the Pascal language had significant value in the educational world. I attached Dennis's response to the cover of my paper, and my professor awarded me the highest grade.

Twenty years later, as indicated above, I discover a form of communication focused on gratitude in Michael Dearing's work. I observed that he expresses great gratitude, such as the gratitude he extended to Barbara Minto, author of "The Pyramid Principle," in his video summary of SCqA (Harrison Metal, 2018), and in the lecture titled "Executive Communication w/ Harrison Metal" (Heavybit, 2019).



### Thanks for letting me know - is looking towards opportunity 


The section below was included in the acknowledgements until the moment when my editor, Vanessa Oliveira, warned me that the text was good, but not for the acknowledgements section. It was at that moment that I realized what I had done and that it could be placed elsewhere.

And now, I would like to share my letter of gratitude, which was in the acknowledgements section and in which thanks to Vanessa is now here. You may or may not want to read the letter below, but the main point of putting the example here for us is that there is a process within the process of giving thanks. Expressing gratitude, identifying gratitude, identifying value, can be a process. We need to make time for it. Perhaps it was the pressure - the need for an acknowledgements section - that led me to see it. But the moment I had written that section, I did not have time to reflect on how the process of thanking people is tied to my life. "Gratitude is Winning," perhaps the title for the next book.

I would like to thank many people and systems that led me to write this book. There were many variables that brought me to the situation of facing the writing of this material. So, I will list a few points, and it is likely that I forgot others because an entrepreneur's life is nothing if not chaotic. In any case, one of the turning points, which only made sense long after I had contact, was the experience of virtually meeting investor Michael Dearing. I had, or pushed myself toward, the fortune of stumbling upon a course titled Blitzscaling1, which was made available by Greylock Partners, a well-known venture capital firm in Silicon Valley.

Right off the bat, I was so excited that I decided to get involved in some way. I reached out to former Mozilla CEO, John Lilly, who was working at Greylock, and asked if I could translate - as a volunteer - the lectures. In a few days, they sent me the English subtitles, and I started the work. Everything was going well; the translation was flowing, and thus I began working on lecture 1, lecture 2. But when I got to the third lecture, Michael's, I simply froze. The material was different and felt more like a lesson. He talked about the concept of creative destruction and management, and then I felt like what was flowing well had become complicated. I simply couldn't translate anymore. When I tried to understand more, I froze even more - I needed to research, learn. That job, which was averaging 30 days (using a few hours per week), simply led me to a zone of curiosity, and with that, I lost focus. In fact, the moment was so strong that I completely changed the direction of my start-up idea and realized that the job of subtitling should depend on prior collaborative work, which should be the job of indexing, organizing, studying the videos. It was at this moment that I had the idea for FastClip, my current startup. I don't know if it will find success, but I know that this experience of investigating videos changed my life and set new paths.

Making "slides" for snippets of Michael's video, I ended up visiting the Harrison Metal website, buying books, and somehow found myself inspired again by serious topics that underpin entrepreneurship. This book brings a little bit of that; this book wants to pause the founder's life to consider serious topics that support entrepreneurship.

Also, in this same section, I need to thank all the creators of the Blitzscaling course: John Lilly, Reid Hoffman, Chris Yeh, Allen Blue, all the people interviewed, and also the students and listeners of the course. Blitzscaling was one of the episodes that taught me that the way to accelerate towards the potential of a great organization should indeed involve a deceleration. This book is about that - decelerating to mind which incidentally is a theme all around in the Blitzscaling lectures. The "B-side" that becomes apparent when watching these lectures, is a quieter place that suggests that a company's growth depends, first and foremost, on the personal growth of its constituents. This "B-side" suggests, for an entrepreneur to be honest with themselves, a humbler person as the foundation for personal growth and the team that will generate a company. We must consider that all innovation depends on a generating function, the seed, the culture - call it what you want.

Of the models above, I would like to leave a specific thank you to John Lilly because his appearance made me start to enjoy entrepreneurship in a different way. I first heard about John when I worked for Mozilla, around 2005. At that time, I felt a great distance between my position and that of a CEO. But that wouldn't have to do with the size of the organization, as Mozilla was quite small in terms of staff. But I didn't know what the CEO really did. I must confess that one day I got nervous when I heard him saying that he was the guy who paid us. I did not like it because I found the phrase somewhat raw and it didn't solve my question. From that moment on, I kept an eye on him and my antennas on. Sometime later, I came across a very honest "life as it is" type of video that I loved and made me connect with John's ideas. The video was removed from the Internet, but it was John having a discussion with a designer that was responsible for the Firefox project design. The discussion at one point has heated around a theme that broadly seemed to be around execution and objectives but initially started as a quest: What is the perfect interface? The designer focused in the view that the best solution, in terms of design, would be to have the problem solved instead of focusing in the tool. To illustrate his point, he had asked us to imagine a shovel, pointing that there are lots of different kinds, with different handles and different materials used on the blades, such as blades made of incrusted diamond. Then he concluded that the ideal shovel isn't the shovel but the hole dug. Although I felt tricked by a professor, like a professor he had made his point about the importance of understanding the real problems that people want to solve. But what intrigued me was the way that John added his perspective, suggesting a different line of thought where tools, even imperfect ones, are more like the tools that people use to come up with creating solutions and to understand the problems they have. When I saw the heated discussion, I found myself in the dilemma of two correct answers and the difficulty in taking a path. But what inspired me was the CEO's point of view seemed to be the perspective new to me. What had provoked my naive and expert side to a level of awareness about the dangers of executing with a roadmap which is assumed to be good. In other words, what he had presented, in alignment with the metaphor, connects with a popular saying in Brazil, "o buraco Ã© mais em baixo,"  which translates as "the hole might be deeper". I agreed - how to know the perfect solution for things before working on them? And I thought it made total sense for a CEO since the leader's job involves to trust the people and allowing them to find answers as they are involved. John's way of thinking implied an idea where people could collaborate and eventually arrive at better solutions that better solves people's problems. That moment had captivated me to endorse John and helped me to be proud to know that under the "guy who paid us" was the person who trusted us even when we thought that we right although we would be still around when we figured that our design, roadmap or plan, wasn'nt perfect. In other words, he welcomed people that were in progress which is an idea that made me to consider being humble.

Perhaps being "around John" was really what had guided me to watch the Blitzscaling lectures with a calmer eye, which brought me to ask him if I could voluteer to do subtitling work, which brings me to also say thanks to friends who helped the translation of the subtitles - Fred Filho, Elderclei Reami, and Rael Gugelmin.

I'm not going to make this a meta thank-you section that includes everyone I would like to thank, because there simply wouldn't be enough pages, and it wouldn't make sense to the reader. So, I've only included these snippets to convey a clear message that there were certain turning points, what I call inflection points, that end up shaping an entrepreneur's path significantly. These points are situations that alter our trajectory. Many of them are challenging situations, like problems that strike us, as if we've been hit by an arrow that forces us to walk to a specific place to remove the arrow from our body - perhaps this could be the arrow of curiosity. When you encounter certain elements, people, or systems, elements that challenge your mind, that sometimes cause you pain, or challenging situations; observe, for it's these points that truly have a significant influence on your path. When you face these challenges of curiosity, try to lean into that direction because curiosity is the greatest creative force of the human being. Curiosity is an endless well of energy and the only thing that explains our ability to pause in the midst of wanting to rush.

### Closer to the right people 

### Educating and creating images 


Sometimes, the act of gratitude can transform into a deeper moment of reflection. The act of expressing gratitude can also open doors precisely because it is multifaceted and, obviously, an act of communication to the external world. It is a letter, and it is quite likely that you are wanting to send the letter. Perhaps my book is a grand letter of gratitude.
