# The feedback of urgency

Although a lot of what we are reflecting have to do with taming urgency, and allowing a viewpoint, it comes a day where the interactions of the doer, or the team executing, might create a condition that sets the team to consider the theme of urgent vs. important. This idea is easily visualized with the Eisenhower matrix [^footnote_matrix_important_vs_urgent], where two axis - urgent and important - let us draw four quadrants: urgent and important, urgent and non-important, non-urgent but important, and non-urgent non-important. This visualization could prompt a team to reason about what is going on with example questions like is the work considered urgent and taking time really is critical? Are there things not being done that are important and should be prioritized to make the situation better? 

[^footnote_matrix_important_vs_urgent]: 

Needless to say it is that judgement and strategy is the critical part - and conversely that a team likely starts with non-urgent and important things, assuming a healthier work situation that supports strategy, where vision is present first. As an illustration, consider a prior movement, such as a movement that started with initial work of important non-urgent, might have taken the team, after successfully working, into a situation of responsibility to sustain the situation that they arrived: the team's prior strategy worked and new customers arrived which caused the team to account active customers which raised the need for customer support. 

In perspective, if the discussion arises, it could be after the team notices a saturation point, which calls for a reflection. This wise team might acknowledge that it was their success, from important non-urgent activities, which brought them customers. Therefore, conversely, the need to attend those customers, and fears such as not losing those customers, makes customer support to appear as urgent and important. To note, that losing those customers does has double weight - as customers are now needed and it would mean lack of responsibility for the risky and strategic work of important and non-urgent that took place first.   

Now, the reference point to our reflection starts with the recognition that the prior matrix - where work was of the nature of important non-urgent - brought change that shifted the use of resources and has created a new matrix configuration for what is urgent. If one had raised a hand and indicated that new problems will arise after having customers, it is likely that a strategic manager would reply that "that is a problem we all want to have." This line, which welcomes a good new problem, reveals the appearance of a measurement system, either explicit or indirect, that takes place, which enables the interpretation, and justification, for a kind of reactionary work that maintains the new equilibrium. 

What is a complication is what would rise from that lonely hand, or brief and weak moment that had attemped to look at the future, that unfortunately in the face of the pursuit of an outcome, was missed. In other words, what is generally overlooked by teams is how strong feedback systems, based on values or expectations or principles, finds a way to maintain a new equilibrium. 

And even more complicated is that the feedback systems may rise not not obvious situations such as of new customers coming in. In other words, the urgency to maintain an equilibrium rises from whatever condition where the team believes of an equilibrium - which can be quite subjective - that should be maintained. But none of that would be a reason to consider urgent vs. important if the seeds of what they planted didn't start to produce fruits or to attract bugs. 

As a consequence - and a reason to honor this complication of entrant feedback systems - we likely will see teams taking care of killing bugs, or managing the fruits given, or an irrigation system, or new processes that rises to solve the urgencies that keeps the equilibrium of that bundled idea, even when what was was  bundled doesn't given any meaningful results. In other words, we work to mitigate the potential explosion in terms of maintenance that would otherwise jeopardize the promise. As an aside, this accounting and management around rising problems, and management of the maintenance, can be so well-done by teams that they are found to get to the point of coming up with actual innovative solutions for getting things done such as solutions for killing bugs, for communication processes, or general processes of maintenance. In other words, we should keep our minds open to the beauty and the dangers of systems that rises from our observation of effects that affects the equilibrium [^editornote_glitch_story] in any given process. 

[^editornote_glitch_story]: Mostly historians of entrepreneurship will by now be able to link the fact of a death of a game company called Glitch (2013) had a connection with what became one of the world's most popular communication tool for teams. According to Cnet, the team's communication tool which was created to support the development of the game became the companies's new purpose and to be known as Slack.

Now the reflection that follows rests in two aspects. 

The first is a temporal analysis that accounts that a movement of the past, such as important non-urgent, after an intent to create a future, does the job of brings a new present reality such as urgent important or not, and by that new challenges that affects the system to come up with a new future, do it again important non-urgent. One possible concern revelas the need to consider this historical perspective by a question: why is it that we can't work anymore in stratetic and important things that could save us from being too busy mainly with these urgent things? 

The second aspect looks at the new elements of feedback that happens to be absorbed, by design or by values, such as principles, but becomes too strong defining the role of a critic, that generally has the power to put the label of urgent and change priorization. The emergence of this critic, in the face of a new present, can go as much as to make a team set the bar so high - as in it gotta be very important! - which naturally sets them to face the fact that they want to have new kinds of assurances, such as of a new order, different from what they would pursuit if they were not framed by fears or value-systems present which defines urgent. This situation brings teams to compare and naturally set a team to be engage in what now appears as risks, or to demand returns for important, that could be a killer of potential important and non-urgent activities in the first place. 


<!-- 

#compassion #aspect2

Another exercise of reflection, which also follows we will be recognizing success as an allocation of resources which is urgent, thus the means that we make urgent to be urgent, the reflection that feedback systems are present, and the critic or measurment system that makes things appears as critical. As much as attempting to talk about the future seems arbitrary, or a risky idea, even more risky is the actual fact that pushes many to do the things as urgent completely driven by a critic that sets them in the actual not have perspectives, such as driven by values, by principles, and undeniably deniying important things, and raising the bar too much for what is impotarnt, as in lacking compassion.

### Temporal analysis 

As we first consider part doer job of an entrepreneur, and as we recognize the growth nature of startups, we recognize that projecting a startup in the future goes inline with what an entrepreneurial role may have done in the first place to move from nothing to an action before it took them into bringing the discussion about urgent vs. important. In other words, an uncertain ideal took a doer to do, and they did, which brought saturation, to the point of the need of perspective again, to change, to project a new future. 

A basic illustration is in order, for how urgent needs emerge. If we set our time machine to the old west and find the day where the hourseshoe of a horse was damaged, and that the worker brought to the willsmith was a so natural response, such as following instincts, a drive to fix and being equilibrium, eliminate that loss, perhaps driven by fear of not able to work. That is an automatic response which might be rooted in the principle of loss aversion, a concept that even behavioral economics had brought to the life of managers to state that the pain of loss is felt more deeply than the joy of an equivalent gain. In other words, our knowledge of the knowledge economy has already recognized that our propensity to react swiftly to mitigate disruptions to our 'known normal' is easily used as a model for the situations that we depend on or that we think will affect our future. It is needless to point that no one monitors anything except when they start to see a pattern of a recurring problem. Therefore, bringing back the equilibrium - such as to fix the horseshoe - consists of clearning the way to keep the focus on the job to be done. 

Now, if we drop the illustration, and keep the essentials, we then recognize that a new equilibrium is a need of a new present, in contrast with a past, which now makes a call to maintain something which is outstanding. More than the specific problem of a team, the arrival of the theme - of important vs. urgent - shows that the new present changed that condition of the past, such as when these now urgent actitivies are demanding resources perhaps at the point of strategic no-urgent can't anymore exist. 

Now if one brings the idea to give more time for seeking important activities, a natural response would demand a plan, as in, a proof. The need of a proof, or assurances, is really a key into a toxic by-product of the success or the situation of saturation. Mainly toxic when it becomes arbitrary, just to kill the reflection for projecting a new future. Now, from a mature managerial pespective, although it matters that the seek important needs new assurances as in the team does not want to destroy it's engine running - it matters more that the growth situation brought a new reference point, like a new start, a new problem. 

In other words, the very fact that a voice of a critic would want to "travel to the future to see assurances" reveals that the nature of assurances has changed, that things have changed, that a new game is in the present, a new beginning. 

To support this temporal analysis let's us enrich this perspective with a reflection from Andy Grove, the late CEO of Intel, from his groundbreaking book "High Output Management," where he had used an analogy of a factory, which allows us to see the situation we have as a box, or a system, thus to see the whole bundled reality of our team's work as if it was a system. And by taking a picture in time, he provokes the analysis in perspective. In his exercise of a 'breakfast factory' analogy, he has illustrated how today's problems often originate from past decisions, or indecisions. 

Grove advocates for a forward-looking approach — today's strategies to prevent potential problems tomorrow. [Elaborates more from the book or bring a citation. ] 

Now, by moving in time, and recognizing growth, we can reconize the change in terms of maturity of the factory. For example, one may initially see that two founders doing research work in the beginnings is good. It is clear. Or that if an early employee steals an egg, it's stealing. But if one travels in the future, where the breakfast factory is too big with tons of eggs being served, a novice manager wouldn't be able to understand that an employee that asked others employees to talk about a topic, would be necessarily about stealing people's time or not. Conversely, the maturity is revealed by the the understanding of how activities are vital to the future, which can be only be considered if you have the courage to bring about the conversations about the goals and the means to get there. 

In other words, a new beginning. As example, by comparing with the past, the team might understand that the nature of assurances were different - they might have self-funded themselves to keep working, and the self-funding were the assurances. Or in a case of a writer, she might have kept work done during her sabbatical. And if the present has a new challenge, these are just the new reference point that would be taken care if a new manager happen to be joining the team now. 

### Consider to put a specific case 

An example of a new demand could simply be an unforeseen event, such as a customer failing to make a payment. When, out of the blue, a customer does not pay, entrepreneurs typically view this as a failure — something that is not right, and thus the event does not get mapped in the entrepreneur's strategy. But here lies a problem because this failure can recur. An example would be the "failure to pay on the due date," which is an issue. If viewed merely as a problem, the entrepreneur runs the risk of overlooking it. However, if seen as an observation, and if there is a pattern, they could, for example, devise a solution such as offering advance credits, allowing installment payments, or lending money to the client with interest, among other options.

#### Consider the abstract the specific 

A ideia de “status atual”, a demanda, a quantidade de clientes, a quantidade de alunos que você tem, etc. Isso é o presente, que também envolve a capacidade atual de atendimento, como sua energia disponível, agenda disponível, ou mesmo insumos em estoque. Se fosse no caso da sua banca na feira, seria aquilo que você tem na bancada que está mais ou menos previsto em cima da quantidade de pessoas que passa e seu planejamento e capacidade atual de fornecimento. Este então é o presente atual, ou status do presente.

#### Consider to kill or a question? Can be presentd to intro the next?

Then comes the question — do I have to try to foresee everything? Do I need a highly experienced consultant in every area? Is there such a guru? The idea isn't to become an omniscient being — that would be the greatest of mistakes precisely because someone who claims to know everything is more blind than all-knowing, given the dynamic nature of the world. But the concept of highlighting, as a demand, and thinking that the problem of the present is out of time, is a chance for you to act with a planning response and not with the default option of just doing things which often could mask the problem. With this, you begin to establish a new perspective on the things that happen. For instance, imagine that a theft occurs at your store. It was robbed, but if you can see that theft is a demand, a new event that can happen again, the response you work on is at another level. You might need to put in place insurance, cameras, or even change the way you distribute your product. Obviously, all this is much more complicated at the moment things happen — precisely because events like thefts, or even customer delays, are situations that change our emotional state. But in Andy's view, what you have is a factory, a machine, that operates out of time — as if you thought your organization is an unchangeable mechanical piece, which you bought last year and is operating today. Like a factory that cannot stop, the way to orchestrate its evolution mechanism is to act out of time.

## The aspects of values 

By forcing projoectsions of growth, looking as box, factory, it forces new operational reality, which lifts the gap and contrast with present "factory". Both helping to find urgent-important but also important-import that will need to take care. Besides the exercices, we will continue on how sometimes we are trapped by strong feedback systems of now influencing our inability to even do the exercise, and how some new perspectivees can help. 

But to keep in mind that all will depend on what you are doing at the moment - thus the real trick will be always to access beyond instint into intuition which has to do with the after growth and depends on humble managemnt and conscious. 

### Feedback amateur - Family situations are networking, representativeness, metworking way up 

Assim, a ideia geral é aprender. Mas a partir dessa ideia precisamos falar sistemas de feedbacks que naturalmente procuramos como resposta para saber se estamos no caminho certo. Para isso vamos começar com família e amigos, como um caso ilustrativo mas bem real no mundo dos empreendedores, principalmente quando começam, já que começam de fato muito sozinhos [^footnote_sam_altman_entrepreneurs_lonely] que demanda abordar um assunto que pode ser visto como nível de honestidade. Honestidade é uma questão importante porque o empreendedor, em teoria, precisa de um feedback honesto. Mas isso é difícil porque ao mesmo tempo o empreendedor quer ser bem sucedido. Então existe um dilema, no meio dessa urgência, entre fazer acontecer a história do sucesso e receber as notícias como elas são de fato. 

[^footnote_sam_altman_entrepreneurs_lonely]:

E falar de família e amigos é importante porque essas pessoas também vivem, de certa forma, no mesmo “balaio” do dilema. Um amigo empreendedor, por exemplo, pode querer lhe encorajar e por isso pode ficar acanhado em lhe dizer verdades que poderiam machucar ou desmotivar. Ou o contrário. O mesmo ocorre com família. Dependendo da cultura familiar, o empreendedor pode receber um feedback que não é honesto, ou que é superficial, porque a pessoa quer agradar, quer motivar; ou em alguns casos até desmotivar, por exemplo projetando medos, já que muitas vezes a questão da motivação ou desmotivação está atrelada com questões de controle e proteção da outra pessoa. Um amigo poderia lhe desmotivar ao focar em questões de riscos porque ele está com medo que você possa falhar.

#### Adora's case proves that friends and family are being mapped into the problem of networking 

A empreendedora Adora Cheung vai além e sugere o conceito da Curva da Honestidade (How to Start a Startup, 2014, 21:18), indicando que tem gente que irá mentir. Vamos estudar como funciona a curva. No eixo vertical temos Nível de Honestidade (Honesty Level). No eixo horizontal temos o nível de relacionamento das pessoas começando com a mãe (mom) depois amigos depois pessoas:

![Curva da honestidade](images/adora/honesty.png)

Adora apresenta duas curvas com o nível de honestidade do feedback dado por diferentes tipos de pessoas. Primeiro vamos olhar para o produto que não é de graça (a curva vermelha acima), por exemplo um produto pago. Neste caso a sua mãe provavelmente será pouco honesta com você. Na medida que avançamos, para o lado dos amigos, veremos que eles são mais honestos que a mãe. Então, para produtos pagos, quanto mais distante, no rumo das pessoas anônimas, veremos mais honestidade.

Aí você diz — ah mas minha mãe fala tudo na lata. Ou ainda, todos os meus amigos são honestos comigo. O problema é realmente saber a perspectiva que cada pessoa colocou na hora do feedback. O que ela queria quando estava te passando o feedback. Pode ser que essa pessoa irá mudar o olhar justamente porque tem um grau de amizade com você e quer seu melhor.

O que aprendemos com isso? Que não podemos lançar nosso carrinho de lanche para a mãe e familiares. Ou eles vão mentir elogiando demais ou vão contrariar demais – por exemplo se você não usar o tempero da vovó?

Na outra abordagem, quando os produtos são de graça, dai temos problemas em obter feedback de pessoas anônimas. Então se você fizer um lançamento de um produto e falar para o bairro que é free, e tentar pegar feedback, é bem provável que um monte de gente irá mentir falando que gostou. Talvez eles estejam simplesmente com fome.

#### Case of Adam also creates a contrast of maturity for feedback of experts vs. feedback of immaturity 

A questão do feedback da mãe é abordada pelo professor e psicólogo Adam Grant no livro Originais (????). Adam Grant coloca 4 tipos de pessoas nos quadrantes gerados por dois eixos. No eixo vertical temos, acima, aquele perfil de pessoa que ajuda os outros (giver) e abaixo o que quer tudo para ela (taker). No eixo horizontal, do lado direito aquela que negativista-discordante (disagreeable) e no lado esquerdo a pessoa positivista-concordante (agreeable):


![Adam eixos concordante discordante](images/adam/agreeable-disagreeable.png)

Adam sugere que o melhor perfil para buscar feedback é aquele que gosta de ajudar mas que faz de forma discordante ou honesta. Ou seja, aquele que não necessariamente concorda com tudo que você diz mas continua sempre do seu lado — aquele que continua dizendo “olha, eu acho que não vai dar certo porque tal e tal”. Para Adam, a mãe normalmente está no quadrante dos que querem ajudar mas concorda com tudo porque está influenciada pela relação.

O ponto principal não é sobre o concordar ou discordar e sim sobre o grau de honestidade oferecido pelas pessoas. Ainda, torna-se relevante saber quem são elas. No caso do Espetinho de Carnes não é legal pegar o feedback de vegetarianos. Ou olhando por outro lado, talvez seja legal já que você espera que eles lhe digam que não é bom. Então no fundo mesmo o que vale é a consciência sobre a pessoa que está lhe oferecendo feedback, um trabalho quase que mais importante do que pegar o feedback em si.

Mas isso não quer dizer que amigos não podem participar ou mesmo financiar seu projeto certo? O que estamos abordando aqui é a questão da leitura e interpretação do feedback na relação do produto; não a relação da família e amigos com o empreendimento em si.

### Feedback Proteced by local-global representativeness, manipulation 

<!-- 

Quantum observation? If no camera saw, it behaves with variability. 

* Subject: Local can mean a lot - like a mom. But local can also be opportunity to do it again, if the global didn't see, like the multiple launches of Airbnb. 

--> 

Para todo empreendimento tem uma questão complicada que é uma ideia que diz que o produto precisa ser lançado no mercado. Alguns empreendedores dizem lançamento; já outros dizem inauguração. Mas em essência é uma projeção, algo que é oferecido, para alguém, onde o feedback levado em consideração. A ideia de lançar produtos não prontos tornou-se normal, com o entendimento que não existe serviço ou produto que é pré-pensado de forma perfeita ou que não existe produto que sobrevive ao contato com o cliente sem sofrer modificações na mesma forma que não existe plano de negócios que sobrevive a um primeiro cliente [^footnote_steve_businessplan_fail]. Ainda, existem situações cada vez mais comuns e menos aparente no mundo offline mas super aparentes no mundo online, onde empreendedores lançam seus projetos múltiplas vezes, de novo e de novo, para iterar, melhorar com base na experiência interativa com o mercado ou com o que acham que é o mercado. Ou seja, o processo de revisão e melhoria dos produtos, ou serviços, está ligado a participação do meio externo, por exemplo com envolvimento de clientes mas vários outros papéis que dão suporte para a evolução. 

[^footnote_steve_businessplan_fail]:

Primeiro, vamos abordar o caso dos múltiplos lançamentos, já que este caso carrega a ideia sobre aprendizado. Uma boa ilustração está na história do Airbnb. Segundo o co-fundador Brian Chesky (2015), o Airbnb foi relançado várias vezes. Com os múltiplos lançamentos, o projeto inicial foi se tornando conhecido. Eles comunicavam para blogueiros que escreviam sobre o Airbnb de forma orgânica (não eram remunerados) e isso abriu caminho para que publicações mais importantes, como CNN ou New York Times, eventualmente escrevessem.

Segundo o relato de Brian, eles podiam relançar o site várias vezes porque se ninguém havia visto, então poderiam assumir que nada estava lançado! Essa situação do Airbnb acompanha aquele ditado que diz que se uma árvore caiu na floresta e ninguém viu então será que realmente caiu? Mas a questão importante não está no lançar por lançar e sim nas questões de aprendizado e ações de mudanças a partir das experiências reais. Então podemos dizer que a ideia de múltiplos lançamentos é uma ideia na linha do movimento lean que diz — vamos usar uma abordagem experimental. Desta forma podemos ir testando e aprendendo. No caso do Airbnb, os fundadores tiveram a oportunidade de participar durante os lançamentos, de viver junto com a comunidade, ouvindo os usuários e descobrindo oportunidades com uma interação mais direta.


#### Protected by market - permission to not scale to protect 

<!-- 

Consider to support the point of locality isolation of Brian 

 --> 

A expressão "faça coisas que não escalam" foi lançada por Paul Graham (PG) em Julho de 2013 para ajudar empreendedores que sofrem de uma síndrome: Quando eles só tentar executar um crescimento precoce e ficam impedidos de aprender. Com essa ideia PG não quer que o empreendedores fiquem parado no tempo. Ele quer que eles possam ganhar o jogo, no final; não exatamente ganhar só a primeira partida.

Inspiração — "Quase todas as startups são frágeis, inicialmente. E essa é uma das maiores coisas que fundadores inexperientes e investidores (e repórteres e os sabe-tudo de fóruns) entendem errado sobre elas. Eles inconscientemente julgam startups embrionárias pelos padrões das que estão já estabelecidas. Eles parecem alguém olhando para um bebê recém-nascido e concluindo "não há nenhuma maneira desta pequena criatura jamais alcançar qualquer coisa." Paul Graham [1]

### Protecting by values and principles 

Agora imagine uma pessoa psicóloga experiente e de sucesso que utiliza uma máquina do tempo para visitar, hà quinze anos atrás, aquele primeiro doa quando um cliente atrasou pela primeira vez. Hoje seus clientes atrasam muito pouco pois estão, digamos assim, educados. Mas você visitou você mesma para olhara a sua cara sobre como recebeu o cliente atrasando. E agora você está pasma, porque lembrou que aquele cliente que atrasou foi de fato recebido com um grande sorriso e um abraço até. De fato você até parece que comemorou que está tudo bem. Ficou claro para você que havia ficado super feliz porque deixou ele atrasar. Ao olhar em perspectiva, você observa aparentar que você queria ser legal. Mas, agora, em defesa do seu ser do passado, você nota que você estava sim interessada em ajudar aquela pessoa, você se preocupava com ela. Ainda, é importante lembrar do contexto, que você tinha somente 5 pacientes, que estava super feliz por ter 5 pacientes. Hoje você tem 50 e até se vê um pouco triste porque teve que enfrentar a difícil decisão de cancelar um dos clientes que faltou 3 vezes na sequência. 

Talvez as coisas ficam até mais difíceis ainda porque normalmente o empreendedor nem acredita que seu negócio está crescendo, ou que aquilo estaria prejudicando o crescimento, ou ainda acredita que crescer daquela forma é melhor até porque existe uma proteção por princípios - eu faço o bem. AInda, poderia se tornar cruel, ou ser uma fraude, ou infringir algo que poderia descarrilhar tudo que está, mesmo com falhas, acontecendo. Ou seja, neste sentido do exemplo, o feedback fo cliente é vital, ele está feliz. 

Então, mesmo que seja um certo problema, de fato, prefere lidar com o problema no dia que tiver 50 clientes e 10% deles estão atrasando. Tipo, aquela notícia “triste” que todo mundo sonha — ah, se um dia 10% de 50 clientes atrasam consistentemente estar bem! Este é um caso de origem do importante, eu sei, mas que pode agora ficar para ddepois; mas mais que isso é a realização do que um outro importante está conflitando com aquele importante. O outro importante está em fusão governando urgente. Então poderíamos de fato mudar a matrix?

Com isso, fica difícil transcender, interpretar, e tentar criar formas que um novo futuro abra caminho para as coisas melhorarem, sendo que assume-se que certas possíveis coisas importantes estão de fato impedidas por princpipios, tipo: neste momento, não posso fazer isso com essas pessoas. Segundo Reid Hoffman [The Startup of You] o relacionamento da amizade cria uma situação difícil para um feedback honesto e isso explica como é difícil, por exemplo, demitir um amigo na empresa. (Pegar referência do livro do Reid  e exemplo)

The introduction of new models of behavior and work is therefore critical but tough. The exercises of trust in how more experience profissional works and why, and what they are after, what they had to embrace, is a way to get out. Você ainda pode aprender conversando com outros empreendedores e observando negócios de outros. WIth more awareness, naturally pacience may also lead to, first, awareness of observations, such as when you note, first, you collect. This, in itself is difficult to do as well because the very exercise of noting will trigger the feelings and the conflicts with the dualility of important things governing the urgent. 

#### Exercising new values 

Plus, the change, when it is time to apply, will be tough which will need either transparency, explanations, education - thus there is effort, and it pulls into a zone of uncomfort. Just like the professional has to take care of her customers, abstracting beyond the each served event, in a holistic way which in the case of the psychologist professional has to do with the "prontuário"; there is the same in-perfective reflective writing for the entity or group of customers versus the value for the business growth whch relates to what is better for them? What conditions or conditioning of my customers can put me in a good position to help them even more? What customers I will eventually have to educate them or say no. 

Implica que você pode criar soluções e muitas delas podem até se tornar soluções simples como até frases. Por exemplo, indicar aos participantes onde fica o banheiro ou apresentar certos pontos que governam uma boa saúde da relação. These solutions are done in the proportional that transparency of these "regulation" systems appear, in contracts, in hallways, in communications, by other paritcipants, and collaborators. Thus, it might have to do with culture, a culture that regulares the constituents to establish conditions of growth and equilibrium for success, which requires to place the customer in certain categories and under behaviors too. 

Com a prática deliberada desse exercício, com o tempo você não irá desesperar, ou criar uma solução aleatória que pode até lhe prejudicar, na frente do cliente — porque saberá que o aprendizado em cima de demandas novas sempre irá lhe ajudar a entender soluções automatizadas para o futuro. Tem empreendedor que inclusive sabe agradecer assim que ocorre um evento novo, adverso, que não estava esperando — mesmo uma pauta bomba que apareceu. O cliente diz “Olha, não tem papel no banheiro” e a empreendedora responde “obrigado pela observação e nos desculpe. Vou trabalhar em garantir que esse padrão seja anotado para que não se repita” que é diferente de “Zézin, coloca papel no banheiro”. A empreendedora mais consciente, que está fora do tempo não irá engajar na situação urgente e irá anotar, observar e depois poderá solucionar o problema da falta de papel higiênico no banheiro colocando dois rolos e uma anotação que diz quando um dos rolos está vazio, trocar.

#### Exercising from principles 

Compromissos também podem servir como uma poderosa contra-estratégia para nossas reações automáticas. Por exemplo, você deseja introduzir um novo sanduíche no seu menu, mas as restrições de tempo são uma barreira. Anunciar o produto antes de seu lançamento real, ou até mesmo pré-lançá-lo como um protótipo, pode impor um compromisso.

A perspectiva do filósofo Robert Nozick, conforme explicada pela professora Tamar Gendler, reforça essa abordagem. Gendler menciona Nozick em uma palestra sobre "Fraqueza da Vontade e Procrastinação", afirmando que, "Princípios, diz Nozick, constituem uma maneira de nos amarrar ao mastro, não através de restrições externas como cordas, mas através de compromissos internos para seguir seus mandatos" (Gendler, 2012, 37:30). Esse conceito é semelhante a decidir não fumar um cigarro - uma ação individual que sinaliza um compromisso mais amplo com a saúde. No contexto do nosso protótipo de sanduíche, isso representa um compromisso com a inovação e crescimento futuro.

Em essência, você faz um compromisso onde, de certa forma, passa a "se enganar" taticamente para reagir de maneira diferente ao seu comportamento padrão. Ao alinhar sua identidade com uma visão de futuro e estabelecer um compromisso com uma mudança antecipada, você promove uma sensação de estabilidade, o que pode lhe dar chances de evitar reações automáticas. No caso do protótipo de sanduíche, isso poderia lhe ajudar quando um primeiro cliente diz que falta sabor; e você poderia responder que o produto ainda está em desenvolvimento e que o feedback dado será levado em consideração, além de oferecer para o cliente desculpas. 

Em conclusão, sabemos que nossa reação inata pode nos compelir a corrigir problemas rapidamente - o que é bom. Porém, nossa reação automática e rápida também pode ser pausada e pedir um momento de re exão - sobre nossas possíveis ações. Ainda, podemos justificar acionarmos o pensamento estrategico que pode abrir caminho para soluções de longo prazo. Ao refletirmos sobre as nossas tendências naturais, podemos iniciar mudanças positivas, nos levando mais rápido para um futuro melhor. 

### Protecting by leadership

Requires respect to the fact that things won't go so well as I am doing manually. 

The design phase of management is one particular aspect that goes along with execution, cause management doesn't see aspects of an entrepreneur effort as isolated. It is concerned with the past, present, and future. Because of this nature, the manager may find herself in a particular situation of leadership. This particular situation might recognize when a manager is critical in its role. 

When she manages the present and also the future and therefore feels as necessary - or using Peter Drucker terms, to be someone - and the same is the general perception of her peers. 

From this situation, it comes the possibility that she might need to leave, to be absent, such as to take time off. But vacation can't happen. With that, vacation never happens because the possibility of taking her out implies that things might go off track. That the state of health for the organization's future and present might be at risk. In other words, risk for anything planned for its future, plus stability for the situation of the present.

When she really faces the fact that the release of herself is likely necessary, therefore, comes the complication and work that consists of separating her roles, what she does for the present and future needs. From another perspective, it is an opportunity for her to "automate" her responsibilities or seek the traits that would make her, or the analytis of herself in autopilot, taken for granted. 

Therefore, it seems that part of what management does is really about automation which aims for producing change in the organization. Or, change that serves growth. 

#### Story of the dishwasher solution

I have written the following letter to editors of a publication

```
Hi editors, 

A draft for an article for your consideration - The Dishwasher Machine Management Problem. When I say consideration, I am not forcing anything. Just sharing. I know that this is simple, it might be more like an outline. 

A lot of people in Brazil refuse to invest in a dishwasher. The reasoning is this: When I wash the dishes, I reflect; it's not that hard. If I get a machine, I have to buy new dishes, change my habit, accept that I have to organize everything perfectly inside, and even pre-clean the dishes. I get mad because it feels like I am working for the machine. And all this to gain, in total, 10 minutes instead of doing it by hand.

Such reasoning makes lots of sense: The machine will do a job very poorly. That machine comes with a mediocre process that costs a lot - a dishwashing machine in Brazil costs 2-3 minimum wage salaries.

Now the dishwasher machine problem is a problem of management. A team manager is tied to the routine, managing the system, accelerating, or pausing its components.

Not much consideration is given to upgrading the process with " a new machine" such as a human resource. At this moment, many excuses will show up, just like the excuses that justify not incorporating that mediocre machine in the process.

But that 10min gain, which received lots of no-go reasons, can be the opportunity for major gains. Consider when a manager adds an intern, for example: Yes, the dishes will need to be adapted, and it might offer a 10-minute, like that mediocre machine.

But similarly to the opportunity of using that extra 10 minutes to do something useful in the kitchen, the manager - and its team - will be able to support that new working piece to improve its maturity.

The difference between the dishwashing machine and your human resource is that the human resource wants to grow if you give her a chance.

ChatGPT comparisons with the case pointed by Melissa of managers hiring senior 

```
Misunderstanding the Integration Process:

[1] People resist investing in a dishwasher thinking it's simpler to continue doing things manually. But even when they buy one, they realize there's a learning curve to using it efficiently.
[2] Managers often feel it's arduous to onboard new team members, so they opt for hiring more senior personnel thinking it'd be easier. However, even the senior individuals require a period of adjustment.
Underestimating the Onboarding Process:

[1] Dishwashers might save only 10 minutes of manual washing time, but they come with their own set of instructions and requirements (e.g., organizing dishes, pre-cleaning).
[2] Hiring senior personnel doesn't eliminate the need for onboarding. Every new team member, regardless of their seniority, requires time to understand the organization and its processes.
Cost vs. Value:

[1] Dishwashers in Brazil are expensive, costing 2-3 minimum wage salaries. People weigh this high cost against the perceived marginal gain in efficiency.
[2] Hiring senior personnel might be costly in terms of salary, but managers expect an immediate return in terms of productivity and efficiency, which might not be realistic.
Potential for Growth and Improvement:

[1] The analogy hints at the idea that if one properly utilizes the saved 10 minutes, it can be put to other productive uses in the kitchen.
[2] By properly onboarding and training a new hire, even if they are an intern or junior member, there's potential for significant growth and contribution to the team.
Resistance to Change vs. The Need for Thoughtful Integration:

[1] People resist changing their dishwashing habits, even if a machine could potentially make the task more efficient.
[2] Managers sometimes resist the idea of onboarding new team members, hoping to bypass the process by hiring senior personnel. However, thoughtful onboarding is essential for everyone.

### Protected by readiness

( ) Put here the case of critic for growth and containment of Julia 

* p1, ( ) reorder - It seems that "time for unreadiness" has to do with Julia Cameron's Containment concept, where protection has to exist, and the nurturing of the critic for growth to emerge, the one that is compassionate for the under development collaborator. Pick quotes from The Right to Write .168-170. This is under a subsection within 410_automatic_reaction_breaking... ref 43849384-43984983-4938948-5935935

* p1, ( ) insight - check containment protection notion (feat. Julia Cameron, p178-180) with 210_automatic_reaction_breaking and "lean narratives" or #okr #shock-absorbers - check if group thinking carrying values, such as values tied to outcomes, can supress the opportunity when growth of an individual would be possible, ideas for example, by using "he is best at" could lead to reaarangement into mediocre too - this Julia indicates writers in potential becoming journalists - as seen we supress the inner self that could save the situation. Thus, the topic of protection before critics. Might tie with case of "containment" by Julia Cameron, p168-170, check her amazing quotes on picking the friendly critis or friendly editor vs. protecting. Marcio had designed a notion of a black box producer in the face of a critic, when "under development" or vulnerable work, if seem from as a box, might be killed as exposed. But a strategic growth developer-coach, might see into the box, and unbundle, allowing growth, like p178-180 Julia Cameron indicates. Thus the management consideration could have to do with bundle to criticize and unbundle to allow development and growth. 9438988-4304093490-04304903-4928408 (lean, breaking auto reaction)

* Consider - ( ) Check Julia Cameron, p.180, the situstion for strenght vs. weaknesess - and the risk of a critic for a thing that is under development. The case of a writer that needs to do the craft but lacks to protect, via containment as specified by Julia Cameron, and then shows to a critic that is biased by market or other pressures and fails to be a growth-oriented, as shaped by schools and the culture according to her. 

* Consider ( ) Urgent vs. important reflection - As, of course, a natural objection to not deal with "what is important" rises from a pressure, like a critic framed by pressures, present values or needs, which results in "It gotta be very important, to be important" which naturally pushes us into not dealing with it, you lack compassion.

Where does it come from the idea that people have to find time for things, such as special projects? I have, a few years ago, in the sense of trying to challenged myself, fighting that idea as in saying "it does not work like that". And it seemed right but still I caught myself thinking about time and having time. But today, when reading Julia Cameron, I caught a new origin of bad ideas about "having to have time for things" She mentioned envy. That people may be envious of one another that seem to have time. HAve you see that idea? Any other idea which supports the myth of having time? JUlia Cameron brought the word victimization of time too. 

This idea of envy might open a good reflection that gives us a view about what seems to be a mature or a corporate version of the individual that is envy of the hypothetical other that has time. What fundamentally goes on with the "envy" is a comparison mechanism, which trigger us to compare with the "other entity" that has more resources and the right conditions, the investment, gas in the tank, you name it. 

Julia Cameron points the situation of "would be" writers that can't exercise the fundamental mechanism, they can't write. She asks them to make time, and as they do, that they might find themselves doing it, being able to allocate time. They are "opening" time against others, perhaps as a sense of safety increases. And for that, for writers, they need to nurture that condition, so that their strugle or need to be ready, readiness, is lessed.

* Abstract - The article "The Right Mood for Progress: Overcoming Paralysis by Analysis in Entrepreneurship" explores the natural inclination of individuals to gravitate towards tasks where they feel in control and the challenges they face when dealing with more complex activities in entrepreneurship. It highlights the fear of "paralysis by analysis," which can hinder decision-making and progress. Drawing from Julia Cameron's approach for writers, the article suggests an exercise involving self-reflection to overcome these barriers. By understanding their automatic tendencies and cultivating the right mindset, entrepreneurs can tackle demanding tasks with greater confidence and achieve success in their ventures.

## SCqA v0.2 

* SCqA - Situation - Analysis paralysis is a situation of when people justify stopping the analysis work and focus on what appears to be pragmatic, where learning can happen as things move, it is real as a device, has good intentions. 

* SCqA - Complication - The generalization of the possible action - of avoiding analysis - can become a device, a thought-tool, used in all sorts of circumstances. Not many talks about what comes before Analysis Paralysis, such as fear and control. 

* Different - This article takes a different approach to the concept of "analysis paralysis" compared to typical discussions. It recognizes the importance of being in the right mindset for progress and incorporates a writing exercise from Julia Cameron to foster self-reflection. By embracing this approach, entrepreneurs can overcome challenges more effectively and strike a balance between preparedness and action.

Some activities naturally pose a challenge to initiate. Imagine, as an entrepreneur, if you had to redesign your sales process, devise a new strategy, or reflect about the culture in the early stage of your start-up. These tasks often carry expectations and elicit strong emotions as our minds gear up for thoughtful analysis. Well, not really. If an activitity ahead is taken as not important, the natural reaction might be to ignore it in formal terms, quite strong, although of course a definite move firm after the feeling of certainty. 

Indeed, we naturally gravitate towards tasks where we feel we have a firm grip on the steering wheel. These are the activities where we're in control, where we can clearly see the road ahead and navigate the journey at our own pace. Yet, when it comes to other activities, such as challenging where how do to and results can't be measured, we might feel anxiety, or fear, or a sense that it won't progress. For that, we do have good reasons, such as the desire to be safe. We want to be prepared for these kinds of activities. The idea of progressing through planning and analysis isn't as straightforward as following a recipe even when it is labor-intensive. In other words, is more comfortable to run on the gas pedal when we don't have to review the road map or even the trip strategy. 

With this openning, it is not that we entirely give up doing things that requires redesign. It is just that we want to be in a good position, to be in the right mood, to be prepared, ready, and having things sorted out. This situation plagues all sorts of professionals, but especially the roles that involves leadership such as of entrepreneurs. 

### Search for reasons for timeless 

Furthermore, the notion of "analysis paralysis" frequently resonates in our minds, embodying the fear that we may become so wrapped up in overthinking and overanalyzing that we end up immobilized, incapable of making decisions or taking action. This fear can amplify our anxiety and the perceived necessity to be 'in the right mood' to tackle these demanding tasks. While the real situation of analysis paralysis can indeed be debilitating, the prevalence of this concept in discussions and self-reflections often heightens the apprehension about engaging with tasks that seem to be complex. It's essential to distinguish between the phenomenon that gave rise to the concept - of analysis paralysis - and the rhetorical device it has become, often used to accentuate the fears and which challenges the execution of important tasks. 

Conclusion? We need to be in the right position to advance, in a good mood, in a positive emotional state, and the readiness condition in general, that gives us more control towards the outcome. But to get out of this need that prevents us from advancing more complex reflections, and in the pursuit of a solution, it is need to emphasize the value, in the first place, of the exercise of reflection on this automatic tendency of ours. Furthermore, it is worth considering Julia Cameron's idea for the situation of writers - which can shed light for entrepreneurs. The exercise that Julia suggests consists of writing - for example for 10 minutes - about what is on your mind, some concern, for instance, a lack of preparation. From there, try to write for another 5 minutes about how your mood towards the activity has changed. She asks us to make a sort of report on the experience.

Research: Look for the specific part in "Maslow on Management" where Abraham Maslow compares and contrasts the mindsets of a controller and a creative individual. Understand the context and implications of this comparison.

Analysis: Analyze the tension between trying to control the outcome of potentially risky unknown tasks and the subsequent pull towards this mindset. Consider how this tension might lead to the anxiety, expectation, and need to "be in the mood" before initiating certain tasks.

Connection: Investigate how Maslow's work supports the concept of needing to be in a certain mindset or mood to tackle challenging tasks. Draw connections between his theories and the ideas presented in your writing.

Not unlike, it also happens in the life of writers, as illustrated by Julia Cameron (1998) in 'The Right to Write'. It is a phenomenon that plagues all sorts of professionals, especially those in leadership or entrepreneurial roles.

## Conclusion 

As interpersonal relationship arises, feedback systems chimes in. We gotta be driven by and free of. And going back to values of higher-order goals, going back to values of a system that gives people opportunity to grow, are important aspects to nurture time for. Thus, it is the responsibility of the entrepreneur and the executive team to deal with this, to use time for this, mapping, unbundling, being a critic and being a growth mentor, giving permission too, openning protective spaces of bets and separating risk analysis.
