# The feedback of urgency

It comes a day where the interactions of a doer, or the team executing, might set the stage when the team brings up the discussion of urgent versus important. This idea can be visualized by the Eisenhower matrix [^footnote_matrix_important_vs_urgent], where the axis from non-urgent to urgent intersects with the other non-important to important, which leads to four quadrants: urgent and important, urgent and non-important, non-urgent but important, and non-urgent non-important. If this matrix appears in a discussion, it might prompt the team to ask questions such as "why the work considered urgent is really considered critical?" or "are there things not being done that are important and should be prioritized to make the situation better?" 

[^footnote_matrix_important_vs_urgent]: 

The discussion shows that something has changed and that new planning is in order because something might be wrong. To illustrate, consider a prior work that was assumed to be stratetic, such as seeking a set of initial customers. As the work is performed, it creates a new reality where urgent needs emerge, such needs to keep customers happy. And the opportunities of maturity rises with the awareness that the new reality, such as keeping customers happy, started to affect the use of time, along with other considerations such as that new strategies could set team in a direction for a better future, such as to work with the right customers. 

In perspective, when and if this discussion arises, it might do so after the team notices a saturation point. A wise team would indeed respect that it was the prior move - such as their success in executing important non-urgent activities - that brought them customers. Conversely, the need to attend those customers, and fears such as of losing these customers, makes initiatives, such as customer support, to become urgent. To note, that losing those customers does has double weight - as customers are now needed and it would mean lack of responsibility for the risky and strategic work of important and non-urgent that took place first. If a team member had raised a hand and indicated that new problems will arise after having customers, it is likely that a strategic manager would reply that "that is a problem we all want to have." This line of reply, by the very fact that it welcomes good new problems, reveals a level of awareness of a measurement system, either explicit or indirect, and how it takes place, which enables the check of an equilibrium and justification for the reactionary work that gets prioritized as urgent. 

What is complicated is the perception that almost takes place with the rise of that lonely hand that was silenced. In other words, teams starts with planning a matrix of work that is strategic enough to change a reality, but as numbers appears - such as the count of customers - they embrace certain problems as new good problems - simultaneously silencing discussions - that should be taken care in order to maintain an equilibrium of a situation or the numbers that apparently protects their growth. In perspective, values appears to justify cleaning up the situation that could jeopardize the equilibrium as designed, which denies the analysis of the whole system, the redesign of a new matrix of work. 

And even more complicated is that this feedback isn't as simple as "that customer isn't happy." In reality, it may go all the way into the hidden parts that keeps the system standing. As an illustration, if an electronic system happens to be used to monitor the satisfaction of customers, and if by a chance a customer tried to indicate an interaction through that system and happened to find a problem dealing with the interface, it is not uncommon a reactive work to take place, thus to bring back what is assumed to be the only way where customers can interact. 

But none of that would be a reason to consider urgent vs. important if the seeds of what they planted didn't start to produce fruits or to attract bugs. As a consequence - and a reason to honor this complicated intrusion of feedback systems - we likely will see teams taking care of killing bugs, or managing the fruits given, or an irrigation system, or new processes that rises to solve the urgencies that keeps the equilibrium of some system which they have bundled which seems to represent meaningful results. In other words, we not only work to keep stability for the things we value but also to mitigate the potential explosion of problems from the maintenance of that stability that would otherwise jeopardize the work. As an aside, this accounting and management around rising problems, or a management of maintenance, can be so well-done by teams that they happen to come up with innovations such as to maintain systems up, solutions for killing bugs, among other communication processes. In other words, we should keep our minds open to the beauty and the dangers of solutions [^editornote_glitch_story] that rises from our needs to keep an equilibrium in any given process. 

[^editornote_glitch_story]: Solutions to manage the management problem is not necessarily a problem as it has to do with that teams actually do. As an example, the death of a game company called Glitch became the formation of one of the world's most popular digital communication tool for teams, Slack. According to Cnet (2013), the communication tool was created to support the development of the game.

Now the reflection that follows rests in two aspects. The first is a temporal analysis that accounts that a movement of the past, such as important non-urgent, after an intent to create a future, does the job of setting up a new present reality such as urgent and important or not important, and by that new challenges that affects the system to come up with a new future, which would likely require those important non-urgent activities. One concern revealed by this perspective is a natural question of why is it that we can't work anymore in stratetic and important things that could save us from being too busy with these urgent things? Which naturally sets the team to look at the present and compare possible future timelines in an attempt to identify strategic things that can be done, evaluate risks and rewards, and hopefully set some of the new strategies in the agenda. 

The second aspect looks at the elements of feedback that the team takes in consideration - consciously or not - that happens to set the role of a critic that generally has the power to put the label of urgent to certain activities. The emergence of this critic, which critically has the duty to monitor the urgent activities, but goes all the way into judging new themes that are posed to appreacition; which can go as much as to make a team set the bar too high for ideas of the important non-urgent nature, as if one that says "it gotta be very important!" Thus, we shall also celebrate how the feedbacks that enters the system affects the judgment of everything. 

<!-- 

#compassion #aspect2

Another exercise of reflection, which also follows we will be recognizing success as an allocation of resources which is urgent, thus the means that we make urgent to be urgent, the reflection that feedback systems are present, and the critic or measurment system that makes things appears as critical. As much as attempting to talk about the future seems arbitrary, or a risky idea, even more risky is the actual fact that pushes many to do the things as urgent completely driven by a critic that sets them in the actual not have perspectives, such as driven by values, by principles, and undeniably deniying important things, and raising the bar too much for what is impotarnt, as in lacking compassion.

## Temporal analysis 

As we first consider part doer job of an entrepreneur, and as we recognize the growth nature of startups, we recognize that projecting a startup in the future goes inline with what an entrepreneurial role may have done in the first place to move from nothing to an action before it took them into bringing the discussion about urgent vs. important. In other words, an uncertain ideal took a doer to do, and they did, which brought saturation, to the point of the need of perspective again, to change, to project a new future. 

A basic illustration is in order, for how urgent needs emerge. If we set our time machine to the old west and find the day where the hourseshoe of a horse was damaged, and that the worker brought to the willsmith was a so natural response, such as following instincts, a drive to fix and being equilibrium, eliminate that loss, perhaps driven by fear of not able to work. That is an automatic response which might be rooted in the principle of loss aversion [^footnote_loss_aversion], a concept that even behavioral economics had brought to the life of managers to state that the pain of loss is felt more deeply than the joy of an equivalent gain. In other words, our knowledge of the knowledge economy has already recognized that our propensity to react swiftly to mitigate disruptions to our 'known normal' is easily used as a model for the situations that we depend on or that we think will affect our future. It is needless to point that no one monitors anything except when they start to see a pattern of a recurring problem. Therefore, bringing back the equilibrium - such as to fix the horseshoe - consists of clearning the way to keep the focus on the job to be done. 

[^footnote_loss_aversion]: Check reference to loss aversion in the context of economic systems and general human behavior. Or point to the works from economy. 

Now, if we drop the illustration, and keep the essentials, we then recognize that a new equilibrium is a need of a new present, in contrast with a past, which now makes a call to maintain something which is outstanding. More than the specific problem of a team, the arrival of the theme - of important vs. urgent - shows that the new present changed that condition of the past, such as when these now urgent actitivies are demanding resources perhaps at the point of strategic no-urgent can't anymore exist. 

Now if one brings the idea to give more time for seeking important activities, a natural response would demand a plan, as in, a proof. The need of a proof, or assurances, is really a key into a toxic by-product of the success or the situation of saturation. Mainly toxic when it becomes arbitrary, just to kill the reflection for projecting a new future. Now, from a mature managerial pespective, although it matters that the seek important needs new assurances as in the team does not want to destroy it's engine running - it matters more that the growth situation brought a new reference point, like a new start, a new problem. 

In other words, the very fact that a voice of a critic would want to "travel to the future to see assurances" reveals that the nature of assurances has changed, that things have changed, that a new game is in the present, a new beginning. 

To support this temporal analysis let's us enrich this perspective with a reflection from Andy Grove, the late CEO of Intel, from his groundbreaking book "High Output Management," where he had used an analogy of a factory, which allows us to see the situation we have as a box, or a system, thus to see the whole bundled reality of our team's work as if it was a system. And by taking a picture in time, he provokes the analysis in perspective. In his exercise of a 'breakfast factory' analogy, he has illustrated how today's problems often originate from past decisions, or indecisions. 

Grove advocates for a forward-looking approach — today's strategies to prevent potential problems tomorrow. [Elaborates more from the book or bring a citation. ] 

Now, by moving in time, and recognizing growth, we can reconize the change in terms of maturity of the factory. For example, one may initially see that two founders doing research work in the beginnings is good. It is clear. Or that if an early employee steals an egg, it's stealing. But if one travels in the future, where the breakfast factory is too big with tons of eggs being served, a novice manager wouldn't be able to understand that an employee that asked others employees to talk about a topic, would be necessarily about stealing people's time or not. Conversely, the maturity is revealed by the the understanding of how activities are vital to the future, which can be only be considered if you have the courage to bring about the conversations about the goals and the means to get there. 

In other words, a new beginning. As example, by comparing with the past, the team might understand that the nature of assurances were different - they might have self-funded themselves to keep working, and the self-funding were the assurances. Or in a case of a writer, she might have kept work done during her sabbatical. And if the present has a new challenge, these are just the new reference point that would be taken care if a new manager happen to be joining the team now. 

### Consider to put a specific case 

An example of a new demand could simply be an unforeseen event, such as a customer failing to make a payment. When, out of the blue, a customer does not pay, entrepreneurs typically view this as a failure — something that is not right, and thus the event does not get mapped in the entrepreneur's strategy. But here lies a problem because this failure can recur. An example would be the "failure to pay on the due date," which is an issue. If viewed merely as a problem, the entrepreneur runs the risk of overlooking it. However, if seen as an observation, and if there is a pattern, they could, for example, devise a solution such as offering advance credits, allowing installment payments, or lending money to the client with interest, among other options.

#### Consider the abstract the specific 

A ideia de “status atual”, a demanda, a quantidade de clientes, a quantidade de alunos que você tem, etc. Isso é o presente, que também envolve a capacidade atual de atendimento, como sua energia disponível, agenda disponível, ou mesmo insumos em estoque. Se fosse no caso da sua banca na feira, seria aquilo que você tem na bancada que está mais ou menos previsto em cima da quantidade de pessoas que passa e seu planejamento e capacidade atual de fornecimento. Este então é o presente atual, ou status do presente.

#### Consider to kill or a question? Can be presentd to intro the next?

Then comes the question — do I have to try to foresee everything? Do I need a highly experienced consultant in every area? Is there such a guru? The idea isn't to become an omniscient being — that would be the greatest of mistakes precisely because someone who claims to know everything is more blind than all-knowing, given the dynamic nature of the world. But the concept of highlighting, as a demand, and thinking that the problem of the present is out of time, is a chance for you to act with a planning response and not with the default option of just doing things which often could mask the problem. With this, you begin to establish a new perspective on the things that happen. For instance, imagine that a theft occurs at your store. It was robbed, but if you can see that theft is a demand, a new event that can happen again, the response you work on is at another level. You might need to put in place insurance, cameras, or even change the way you distribute your product. Obviously, all this is much more complicated at the moment things happen — precisely because events like thefts, or even customer delays, are situations that change our emotional state. But in Andy's view, what you have is a factory, a machine, that operates out of time — as if you thought your organization is an unchangeable mechanical piece, which you bought last year and is operating today. Like a factory that cannot stop, the way to orchestrate its evolution mechanism is to act out of time.

## Feedback valuation 

What we have considered so far is generally the idea where by forcing projections of growth a plan might come about to which considers a new operational reality aimed to close the gap in the direction of a different and better future. But if somehow a new configuration sets the agenda of a team, now management has to get into the business of analysis involving priorization, or the regulation of the balance between urgent-important and these new non-urgent-but-important activites. 

Now, although the exercise of escaping from present is helpful to consider alternatives to the use of time, the unescapable complication - which deserves a celebration and reflection - has to do with the forces that gets in the way that makes urgent to be urgent. In other words, a fight worth considering is the battle that happens in the space of feedback, more specificially how teams measure and value what they do. 

We have considered the emergence of a need for assurances for the new proposals of non-urgent activities. As an illustration, a new setting shows an origin where work started from important activities that somehow reached a point where value was captured, by perceptions of accounting by the team, which affects the dynamics so that the urgent priorization emerges from the fact that the present shows that systems, or activities, must be maintained. Therefore, the situation of demanding assurances for anything that is outside these system, our inclination to seeking these assurances of a new order, are not disconnected from the phenomemon of loss aversion which may be shown in the forms such as our demands that anything new can't offend the value which was captured, the demands to continue to capture value, our perception that we have automated, or bundled valued, and a lot more of the like. 

Now a complication from this situation is that the perspective of judgement - for all matters of use of resources and time - changes because the value captured from certain actitivies now feeds a system of values, values that supports the perception of success of the team. In other words, comes the conclusion that we are naturally driven by feedback - either planned and objective, or unplanned and subjective. And what is even worse is that the feedback that we value, that supports urgent to be accounted as urgent, although can be very subjective, it translates in objective aversion to any new idea, or to set clear demands or objective returns or assurances, for anything that does not retro-feed the given value. In other words, the paradox lies if we envision the extremmes: how easy it is to get approved activites that seem to support urgent vs. how difficult it is to get approved new important non-urgent category. 

Now, and before we move on to into how we use and misuse feedback systems, it must be stated that the reflection that follows celebrates feedback- it embraces a natural gift of our human operating system's evolution, to which we can monitor and improve the narratives of our lives. In other words, we should acknowledge that we don't get into the business of monitoring the things we do and value for the sake of being in the same place, static. In the end of the day, we do want to be safe so that we can mess up with risky activities that may provide reward, which may happen to bring about notions of transcendence, growth, success, happiness, and the like. Thus, if we were programmed to value valuable things, we do so that we can continue to invest. Like good friends, we value, we keep them around, and with them around, we hope to feel in better condition to move on and improve our lives. 

### Feedback amateur - Family situations are networking, representativeness, metworking way up 

Although feedback from family and friends may not directly explain how teams use feedback to support decisions about what is urgent, it is a good starting point for the reflection about how feedback ties with values, or how people does engage in the valuation of feedback. 

It is quite common, as entrepreneurs and teams begin their efforts, to exist interactions of seeking feedback from close networks such as seeking feedback from family and friends. It could be that, by doing so, a team is actually exercising navigating by feedback more than actually trying to pull precise truths such as if they are on the right track. But being for one or another reason, it is real that it happens such as in the beginnings where they are more lonely [^footnote_sam_altman_entrepreneurs_lonely], when local network inteaction happens to characterize them trying to reach higher networks of support that supports growth. 

[^footnote_sam_altman_entrepreneurs_lonely]:

As for the feedback by friends and friends, one topic considered is honesty. The difficulty with seeking feedback at this stage starts with the fact that the entrepreneur, project or team, wants to achieve success in the future. So this need, if not an urgency, sets a dilemma as any feedback for the the reality of now is likely to mess up with the opportunity and the future yet to be constructed. 

Talking about family and friends would likely be acceptable, as these folks happen to be in the same nest or in a way or another recognize the dilemma: An entrepreneur-friend, for example, might want to save you from trouble and therefore might select viewpoints that are appropriate. The same happens with family, depending on the family culture, as the received feedback might not be honest because the person wants to motivate, or in other extremme demotivate. In other words, these folks are not free from the dilemma - where opportunity and risks are present in a path of uncertaintly. In other words, through what appears to be an exercise of feedback, it happanes to be also discussions, such as the consideration of perspectives about opportunities and risks. 

Entrepreneur Adora Cheung went all the way to explore the topic through a viewpoint referred as "The Honesty Curve" (How to Start a Startup, 2014, 21:18), indicating that there are people who will lie. Let's look her example of a possible curve. On the vertical axis, she shows honesty level while on the horizontal axis, different kinds of relationships starting with the mother, then friends, then people.

![Curva da honestidade](images/adora/honesty.png)

Adora presents two curves showing the level of honesty in the feedback given by different types of people. First, let's look at an offering that is not free showed by the red curve, for example, a paid product. In this case, according to Adora, a mother is likely to be less honest. As she move towards friends, she considers that honesty improves. She concludes that, for paid products, the further you go towards anonymous people, the more honesty you will see.

Then one might say — ah, but my mother is straightforward - and all my friends are honest with me. The problem is really knowing the perspective that each person had at the time of giving the feedback. What they wanted when they were giving the feedback. It may be that person X would change their view precisely because they have a degree of friendship with you and want the best for you. 

But what could we learn from this? First, that you cannot launch your snack cart by following the advice of your mother and family members. They will either lie by praising too much, or will be contrarians in excess, for example if you don't use grandma's seasoning. But it matters more the abstraction that their feedback is driven by values. And even more that  the situation of seeking feedback from friends necessarilly accepts values to get in the way as, again, without that acceptance it would be too early to be driven by data-driven feedback that could kill the whole effort in the first place. 

And in that regard, matters too the need to improve the awareness about the forms that feedback is shaped by these underlying values that gets in the way. Yet within the realm of friends, professor and psychologist Adam Grant, in the book "Give or Take" [^editornote_adamgrant_give_or_take], had given another chart with four types of people in the quadrants generated by two axis. On the vertical axis, at the top, he has set a person referred to as a giver, and at the bottom a taker, a person who wants everything for themselves. On the horizontal axis, on the right side is the negative-disagreeable type, and on the left side is the positive-agreeable type:

[^editornote_adamgrant_give_or_take]: In the book Give or Take Adam grant explores the behaviors of people giving feedback and how feedback changes depending on characteristics of who gives feedback. 

![](images/adam/agreeable-disagreeable.png)

Adam suggests that the best profile to seek feedback from is someone who likes to help but does so in a disagreeable or honest manner. That is, someone who doesn't necessarily agree with everything you say but still remains on your side — someone who keeps saying, “look, I think this won’t work because of such and such.” For Adam, a mother is usually in the quadrant of those who want to help but agree with everything because she is influenced by the relationship.

The main point is about the degree of honesty offered by people. Moreover, it becomes relevant to know who these people are. In the case of a Meat Skewer business, it’s not ideal to get feedback from vegetarians. Or looking at it another way, maybe one could consider to get feedback from the contrarian group too. Thus, in the end, what matters is being aware of the person, or data, who feedback comes from, the values influencing the perception given, a task almost more important than getting the feedback itself.

### Protected by values 

Now imagine an experienced and successful psychologist who uses a time machine to visit herself fifteen years ago, on the first day a client was late. Today, her clients are rarely late, as they are, let's say, well-trained. But as she went back, the she of the present is astonished to see that her past self had greeted that late client with a big smile and even a hug. She thinks now, "Wow, did I use to hug my patients?" Indeed, she seemed to have celebrated their late arrival, as in reassuring to a friend that everything was okay, as if they were brothers. It is now clear that the psychologist from the past was happy, as if she was supporting the client's tardiness, not for the sake of being late, but as a sort of ethical protocol of compassion.

Thinking forward from looking back, she wonders if she wanted to look nice, as in if that behavior was a form of protection linked her insecurities as she feared to lose the client. She also remembers the context, when she had five patients, when she was quite happy to have five patients. That plus the fact that she was genuinely helping that late person, that she cared about them. Today, she has fifty patients and most of them are on time, as she knows that allowing them to attent their sessions late brings problems for themselves and also for her entire work situation. One the other hand, she feels a bit sad when she has to make tough decision such as when she needs to cancel a client who misses three consecutive appointments.

The passage might show the complex situation that professionals would face as they are called to face the challenges of entrepreneurship, especially when they trained as specialists such as the case of a psychologist. This situation would naturally set the professional, now in the position of an entrepreneur, as to not recognize how the growth of their business depends on other factors. In other words, the psychologist of the past had a strong belief that the core element of her practice, to which the possibility of growth would happen, heavily lied in the doing good to the patients such as  following the practices of her specialization, her experience as a psychologist professional, and other aspects of the professional. This idea could even go all the way to support the perception that if one is too good as a professional, the problems, or good problems of the grown up business, would be solved by a system of support that they like have as they are successful. 

So, even though it may indeed be a problem, one would prefer to deal with the issue on the day when they have 50 clients, and 10% of them are running late. It's like that “sad news” everyone dreams of — oh, if one day 10% of 50 clients consistently run late, it would be good! This is a case of what was initially important, I know, but it can now be postponed; more than that, it's the realization that another important thing is conflicting with the first important thing. This other important thing is merging and requires urgent attention. So, could we actually change the matrix?

With this, it becomes difficult to transcend, interpret, and try to create ways for a new future to pave the way for improvements, considering that it is assumed that certain potentially important things are actually hindered by principles, like: at this moment, I can't do this to these people. Consider the complex situation, according to Reid Hoffman in The Startup of You, where a relationship of friendship creates a difficult situation for honest feedback, and this explains how difficult it is to fire a friend in the company. 

<!-- 

* ( ) p2, The Feedback of Urgency, Fix quote of Reid Hoffman to case from Start up of You and likely link to Conscious Business. 4892489-4928948-48284-483984. 

--> 

> "" Reid Hoffman, Startup of You. 

To note, the very point of Reid - honest feedback - actually in fact stamps the complication, as an young professional having issues with a friend, is likely unable to transcend the friendship to a point of achieving clarity that, as an example, to see firing a friend as doing good. With that, the possibility of supporting the friend - the needs of the present - gets in the way. Therefore, honesty for the younger relationship would perhaps boil down to saving a friend in front of present needs, even if the future business is compromised. While honesty from the viewpoint of a mature relationship in a business environment, would certainly acknowledge a consciousness about the business as an entity [^footnote_conscious_business_fred_kofmann], or mature perspective, where firing the friend is the best thing to do as opposed to keep the person in the business and harming their own future and the future of the business. 

[^footnote_conscious_business_fred_kofmann]: 

The introduction of new models of behavior, although might be recognized as critical, is tough, exactly because values of now, the perceptions of now, can protect the doer from engaging with uncertain practices. In this regard, the only way to get out is to engage into the reflective exercices of getting out of the present such as to evaluate the values of now that are assumed to be the values that could build a better future, vs. other values that could close the gap and bring a better future closer to the present, as opposed to jumping into projecting a full business success that would have success enough to fix the problems and bad practices. 

In this direction, the exercise of consciousness can evaluate the values that are assumed to be vital to keep things as they are. In other words, when we connect values with the things we think are feeding this values, we may better achieve clarity about other things we can do that in fact may feed the same values of other underlying values which are even more important. As an illustration tied to the given example, the professional had understood, through a conscious exercise, that accepting patients late in a consistent matter seemed to be about making them happy, about embracing them with compassion, but the consciousness evaluation and reflective exercise had enabled the professional to not only see that such allowance was doing harm more than good, but a whole well-written justificative that had turned out to be a great explanation for the patient on why to try to be on time. After the psychologist had implemented the explanation, she had even confirmed that patients were happier and improving in healthier ways. In other words, the change of behavior had in fact produced a better good which turned out to be perceived as better good for the pacient and the professional and the whole business entity. In other words, the value of having patients happier were slight improved with an idea of healthier which helped to form a healthier relationship which helped the professinal to achieve clarity about what to say and how to train herself. 

Plus, the change, when it is time to apply, will be tough which will need either transparency, explanations, education - thus there is effort, and it pulls into a zone of uncomfort. Just like the professional has to take care of her customers, abstracting beyond the each served event, in a holistic way which in the case of the psychologist professional has to do with the "prontuário"; there is the same in-perfective reflective writing for the entity or group of customers versus the value for the business growth whch relates to what is better for them? What conditions or conditioning of my customers can put me in a good position to help them even more? What customers I will eventually have to educate them or say no. 

It implies that you can create solutions and many of them can even become simple solutions, such as phrases. For example, indicating to participants where the bathroom is or presenting certain points that govern good relationship health. These solutions are implemented in proportion to the transparency of these "regulation" systems, whether in contracts, in hallways, in communications, by other participants, and collaborators. Thus, it might have to do with culture, a culture that regulates the constituents to establish conditions of growth and equilibrium for success, which requires placing the customer in certain categories and under certain behaviors too.

#### Exercising from principles 

Compromissos também podem servir como uma poderosa contra-estratégia para nossas reações automáticas. Por exemplo, você deseja introduzir um novo sanduíche no seu menu, mas as restrições de tempo são uma barreira. Anunciar o produto antes de seu lançamento real, ou até mesmo pré-lançá-lo como um protótipo, pode impor um compromisso.

A perspectiva do filósofo Robert Nozick, conforme explicada pela professora Tamar Gendler, reforça essa abordagem. Gendler menciona Nozick em uma palestra sobre "Fraqueza da Vontade e Procrastinação", afirmando que, "Princípios, diz Nozick, constituem uma maneira de nos amarrar ao mastro, não através de restrições externas como cordas, mas através de compromissos internos para seguir seus mandatos" (Gendler, 2012, 37:30). Esse conceito é semelhante a decidir não fumar um cigarro - uma ação individual que sinaliza um compromisso mais amplo com a saúde. No contexto do nosso protótipo de sanduíche, isso representa um compromisso com a inovação e crescimento futuro.

Em essência, você faz um compromisso onde, de certa forma, passa a "se enganar" taticamente para reagir de maneira diferente ao seu comportamento padrão. Ao alinhar sua identidade com uma visão de futuro e estabelecer um compromisso com uma mudança antecipada, você promove uma sensação de estabilidade, o que pode lhe dar chances de evitar reações automáticas. No caso do protótipo de sanduíche, isso poderia lhe ajudar quando um primeiro cliente diz que falta sabor; e você poderia responder que o produto ainda está em desenvolvimento e que o feedback dado será levado em consideração, além de oferecer para o cliente desculpas. 

Em conclusão, sabemos que nossa reação inata pode nos compelir a corrigir problemas rapidamente - o que é bom. Porém, nossa reação automática e rápida também pode ser pausada e pedir um momento de re exão - sobre nossas possíveis ações. Ainda, podemos justificar acionarmos o pensamento estrategico que pode abrir caminho para soluções de longo prazo. Ao refletirmos sobre as nossas tendências naturais, podemos iniciar mudanças positivas, nos levando mais rápido para um futuro melhor. 

### Proteced by local-global representativeness 

For every venture, there's a complex issue, an outstanding issue ahead, which is the idea that the product needs to be launched in the market. Some entrepreneurs call it a launch; others call it an inauguration. But essentially, it's a projection, something that is offered to someone where feedback is taken into account.

The idea of launching unfinished products has become normal, with the understanding that there is no service or product that is pre-thought perfectly or that there is no product that survives contact with the customer without undergoing modifications, in the same way that there is no business plan that survives a first customer [^footnote_steve_businessplan_fail]. 

Additionally, situations of this more interactive launching process are increasingly common, although less apparent in the offline world, and very apparent in the online world where entrepreneurs launch their projects multiple times, again and again, to iterate, to improve based on interactive experience with the market or what they think is the market. That is, the process of reviewing and improving products or services is linked to the participation of the external environment, for example with the involvement of customers but also various other roles that support evolution.

[^footnote_steve_businessplan_fail]:

But that is easy to think if we are considering a sort of in-vitro experiment. The complication, however, in the real trenches of entrepreneurship, ties back to the the element of representativeness [^foonote_representativeness_james_green] where a startup team, as it grows its experiments with customers, are essentially navigating the space to collect more valuable data that justifies the growth of the interactions that attends better customer needs. In other words, the complication is exaclty when the data collected is considered as good data which makes the business to responde to that data, thus to lock themselves into limited signs such as to embrace the responsibility from the ties with what are considered real customers. As an example, if your business serves fresh vegetables to local customers, and you have served them well, your ties with the serving them well may prevent your team to use time to serve other customers in different ways, as your system can't generally serve new customers without serving the current customers. And even if doing so is a possibility, generally when your customer base is one big bucket, you are naturally tied into the risk that testing new offerings can put you at the risk of losing your old customers. 

[^foonote_representativeness_james_green]: The element of representativeness, as refered by the professor James Green, in his work Opportunity Analysis Canvas (2015), is a characteristic or tendency of entrepreneurial behavior to trust what is heard and seen in the nearby domain - such as relying on previous knowledge, already known data, their own customers, friends, and the like. 

Now, what is reveally by this exercise is a tension which would naturally provoke, again in theoretical space, into a viable ideas such as "well, we can create cohorts," which is essencially a way to protect groups of customers. But the beauty in the theory, again, does not necessarity translate into solutions in the trenches of doing it, again because of the very points of urgency, of the feedback as valued by values, such as "if we make a new cohort, we might be using time which should be used to keep our customers happy." Therefore, noticing the tension and complication, set us to seek situations, such as cases, that could help us to reflect on how to deal with this tension, how to find ways around. 

In this regard, it is worth considering the case of Airbnb, which is real case where the process of launching several seemed possible. According to co-founder Brian Chesky (2015), Airbnb was launching their startup several times, as they communicated to bloggers who wrote about Airbnb organically - as in not paid - and this paved the way for more important publications, such as CNN or The New York Times, to eventually write about it. But the points of press, tough revealled by Brian, should not confuse us about the underlying process of learning that Airbnb team had the chance to get into, and more important which is a reflection about the conditions, or factors, that enabled Airbnb team to consistently navigate that space of protection such as to be free of the tension and likely liberating them to learn.  

> *"Oh man, so we're one of the companies that launched a bunch of times. I actually learned something, because we kept doing launches to get a lot of press: If you launch and no one notices, you can actually just keep launching. (laughter) And so, we just kept launching. Like, 'We've launched!' And people would keep writing about it, as if we launched. We're like, we'll just keep launching until we get customers. And we would change things and change the name, and we'd launch again. And so the first so-called launch was that first weekend, but that was just three people. The second launch was Air Beds and Conference United States. And we had two customers, I was one of them. And so we decided, we'll launch at least one more time. When I used it in South by Southwest, at the time, there was no payments and you had to stay in an airbed. And a bunch of people was telling me a bunch of things. They said, 'Why do I have to... like, I want to go to London, but there's no conference.' And we're like, 'Why does this have to be for conferences?' At the time, that wasn't even obvious. Why would anyone stay in anyone's home if there wasn't a conference? It would be too weird. And then we thought, 'Wait, why does it have to be on air beds?'"* (Chesky, 2015, 9:40-10:38)

The statement of Brian indicates indeed an ideal situation, from a product in development perspective, or the situation with that goes along with the saying that if tree falls in the forest and no one saw it, did it really fall? Therefore, the greater benefits of that stage didn't lie in the benefits of launching for the sake of launching, such as press for press or press for customers, but the revealed insight that learning from real experiences were happening through the multiple launches; which by the way goes along with the lean movement where experiments exist to bring about data that can help the team to improve the value proposition, the idea of ideal customes, and the like. 

Now, and quite important as we seek the conditions that allowed Airbnb to exercise that interaction with freedom, is the indication of the release of that tension when he said that "If you launch and no one notices, you can actually just keep launching." This is a powerful statement that in fact reveals that the team were free from prior valuation of feedback given, as in it resonates with the idea of freedom where the team feels good to testing out interactions in front of a completely new customers, and doing so whatever they tested could bring in learnings from the prior experiments and at the same time run the risk of testing new ideas with no further damage. In other words, it is possible to consider that the experiments associated with the conferences, at locations, gave them a good condition to engage with the benefits of doing one-time experiments, like an event. 

Now, of course and depending on the team culture, they were subject to running through conferences and aggregating features as in the extremme situation of summing up all the things customers loved which would indeed take them into a bad product or bloated system to maintain. Nevertheless, it can then be established, at least for the purpose of our reflection, the sistuation where the data from local interactions might provole teams to consider that learning from local experiments, can lead them to either bundling into what they want to be the global - which in other words would be about promoting features into what would be the long-term service localities - or isolating in the sense of unbundling what was tested and testing a new configuration with the new locality with the intention or experimenting new promising value.   

Now, and to support another factor of the team culture of Airbnb, it should be also acknowledge that the mentoring process was supported by thoughts of a protective nature, in the sense of liberating a team, represented by Paul Graham with his ideas, such as related to his article "Do things that don't scale" where permission was given to focus on the finding value from interactions as opposed to focusing in the problems of attending the needs of larger markets: 

> *"Probably the most important single piece of advice I got, which is probably advice that is probably the most important advice I can give you, or one of the most important advice, is he [Paul Graham] basically drew out this chart and he basically said, it's better to have 100 people that love you, 100 customers that love you, than a million customers that just sort of like you. In other words, if you have 100 people that absolutely love your product, they'll tell 100 people, and then they'll tell 100 people, or even 10 people, and this thing will grow. We call it growing virally." (Chesky, 2015, 22:01-22:32)

The statement of Brian reveals the tension, the complication, but also the opportunity at the same time, as it states that in order to grown, the team shouldn't seek growth. Or, in other words, it becomes clear that the situation of Airbnb, starting with value around conferences throughout localities, which went along with launching and launching, had enabled them to test local experiments seeking value and more likely free of the ties of keeping up the prior crowd of customers happy, which allowed them to transcend the product, to achieve propositions that could eventually be tested in other larger localities, like when Aibnb moved to offer says in the city of New York. 

### Protecting by leadership

Requires respect to the fact that things won't go so well as I am doing manually. 

The design phase of management is one particular aspect that goes along with execution, cause management doesn't see aspects of an entrepreneur effort as isolated. It is concerned with the past, present, and future. Because of this nature, the manager may find herself in a particular situation of leadership. This particular situation might recognize when a manager is critical in its role. 

When she manages the present and also the future and therefore feels as necessary - or using Peter Drucker terms, to be someone - and the same is the general perception of her peers. 

From this situation, it comes the possibility that she might need to leave, to be absent, such as to take time off. But vacation can't happen. With that, vacation never happens because the possibility of taking her out implies that things might go off track. That the state of health for the organization's future and present might be at risk. In other words, risk for anything planned for its future, plus stability for the situation of the present.

When she really faces the fact that the release of herself is likely necessary, therefore, comes the complication and work that consists of separating her roles, what she does for the present and future needs. From another perspective, it is an opportunity for her to "automate" her responsibilities or seek the traits that would make her, or the analytis of herself in autopilot, taken for granted. 

Therefore, it seems that part of what management does is really about automation which aims for producing change in the organization. Or, change that serves growth. 

#### Story of the dishwasher solution

I have written the following letter to editors of a publication

```
Hi editors, 

A draft for an article for your consideration - The Dishwasher Machine Management Problem. When I say consideration, I am not forcing anything. Just sharing. I know that this is simple, it might be more like an outline. 

A lot of people in Brazil refuse to invest in a dishwasher. The reasoning is this: When I wash the dishes, I reflect; it's not that hard. If I get a machine, I have to buy new dishes, change my habit, accept that I have to organize everything perfectly inside, and even pre-clean the dishes. I get mad because it feels like I am working for the machine. And all this to gain, in total, 10 minutes instead of doing it by hand.

Such reasoning makes lots of sense: The machine will do a job very poorly. That machine comes with a mediocre process that costs a lot - a dishwashing machine in Brazil costs 2-3 minimum wage salaries.

Now the dishwasher machine problem is a problem of management. A team manager is tied to the routine, managing the system, accelerating, or pausing its components.

Not much consideration is given to upgrading the process with " a new machine" such as a human resource. At this moment, many excuses will show up, just like the excuses that justify not incorporating that mediocre machine in the process.

But that 10min gain, which received lots of no-go reasons, can be the opportunity for major gains. Consider when a manager adds an intern, for example: Yes, the dishes will need to be adapted, and it might offer a 10-minute, like that mediocre machine.

But similarly to the opportunity of using that extra 10 minutes to do something useful in the kitchen, the manager - and its team - will be able to support that new working piece to improve its maturity.

The difference between the dishwashing machine and your human resource is that the human resource wants to grow if you give her a chance.

PS: Could connect with Andy Grove on Task Relevant Maturity

ChatGPT comparisons with the case pointed by Melissa of managers hiring senior 

```
Misunderstanding the Integration Process:

[1] People resist investing in a dishwasher thinking it's simpler to continue doing things manually. But even when they buy one, they realize there's a learning curve to using it efficiently.
[2] Managers often feel it's arduous to onboard new team members, so they opt for hiring more senior personnel thinking it'd be easier. However, even the senior individuals require a period of adjustment.
Underestimating the Onboarding Process:

[1] Dishwashers might save only 10 minutes of manual washing time, but they come with their own set of instructions and requirements (e.g., organizing dishes, pre-cleaning).
[2] Hiring senior personnel doesn't eliminate the need for onboarding. Every new team member, regardless of their seniority, requires time to understand the organization and its processes.
Cost vs. Value:

[1] Dishwashers in Brazil are expensive, costing 2-3 minimum wage salaries. People weigh this high cost against the perceived marginal gain in efficiency.
[2] Hiring senior personnel might be costly in terms of salary, but managers expect an immediate return in terms of productivity and efficiency, which might not be realistic.
Potential for Growth and Improvement:

[1] The analogy hints at the idea that if one properly utilizes the saved 10 minutes, it can be put to other productive uses in the kitchen.
[2] By properly onboarding and training a new hire, even if they are an intern or junior member, there's potential for significant growth and contribution to the team.
Resistance to Change vs. The Need for Thoughtful Integration:

[1] People resist changing their dishwashing habits, even if a machine could potentially make the task more efficient.
[2] Managers sometimes resist the idea of onboarding new team members, hoping to bypass the process by hiring senior personnel. However, thoughtful onboarding is essential for everyone.

### Protected by readiness

<!--

( ) Put here the case of critic for growth and containment of Julia 

* p1, ( ) reorder - It seems that "time for unreadiness" has to do with Julia Cameron's Containment concept, where protection has to exist, and the nurturing of the critic for growth to emerge, the one that is compassionate for the under development collaborator. Pick quotes from The Right to Write .168-170. This is under a subsection within 410_automatic_reaction_breaking... ref 43849384-43984983-4938948-5935935

* p1, ( ) insight - check containment protection notion (feat. Julia Cameron, p178-180) with 210_automatic_reaction_breaking and "lean narratives" or #okr #shock-absorbers - check if group thinking carrying values, such as values tied to outcomes, can supress the opportunity when growth of an individual would be possible, ideas for example, by using "he is best at" could lead to reaarangement into mediocre too - this Julia indicates writers in potential becoming journalists - as seen we supress the inner self that could save the situation. Thus, the topic of protection before critics. Might tie with case of "containment" by Julia Cameron, p168-170, check her amazing quotes on picking the friendly critis or friendly editor vs. protecting. Marcio had designed a notion of a black box producer in the face of a critic, when "under development" or vulnerable work, if seem from as a box, might be killed as exposed. But a strategic growth developer-coach, might see into the box, and unbundle, allowing growth, like p178-180 Julia Cameron indicates. Thus the management consideration could have to do with bundle to criticize and unbundle to allow development and growth. 9438988-4304093490-04304903-4928408 (lean, breaking auto reaction)

* Consider - ( ) Check Julia Cameron, p.180, the situstion for strenght vs. weaknesess - and the risk of a critic for a thing that is under development. The case of a writer that needs to do the craft but lacks to protect, via containment as specified by Julia Cameron, and then shows to a critic that is biased by market or other pressures and fails to be a growth-oriented, as shaped by schools and the culture according to her. 

* Consider ( ) Urgent vs. important reflection - As, of course, a natural objection to not deal with "what is important" rises from a pressure, like a critic framed by pressures, present values or needs, which results in "It gotta be very important, to be important" which naturally pushes us into not dealing with it, you lack compassion.

Where does it come from the idea that people have to find time for things, such as special projects? I have, a few years ago, in the sense of trying to challenged myself, fighting that idea as in saying "it does not work like that". And it seemed right but still I caught myself thinking about time and having time. But today, when reading Julia Cameron, I caught a new origin of bad ideas about "having to have time for things" She mentioned envy. That people may be envious of one another that seem to have time. HAve you see that idea? Any other idea which supports the myth of having time? JUlia Cameron brought the word victimization of time too. 

This idea of envy might open a good reflection that gives us a view about what seems to be a mature or a corporate version of the individual that is envy of the hypothetical other that has time. What fundamentally goes on with the "envy" is a comparison mechanism, which trigger us to compare with the "other entity" that has more resources and the right conditions, the investment, gas in the tank, you name it. 

Julia Cameron points the situation of "would be" writers that can't exercise the fundamental mechanism, they can't write. She asks them to make time, and as they do, that they might find themselves doing it, being able to allocate time. They are "opening" time against others, perhaps as a sense of safety increases. And for that, for writers, they need to nurture that condition, so that their strugle or need to be ready, readiness, is lessed.

v2.2

* https://chat.openai.com/share/11e18a75-c970-41be-8e3a-9ed870e702b3

* Abstract - The article "The Right Mood for Progress: Overcoming Paralysis by Analysis in Entrepreneurship" explores the natural inclination of individuals to gravitate towards tasks where they feel in control and the challenges they face when dealing with more complex activities in entrepreneurship. It highlights the fear of "paralysis by analysis," which can hinder decision-making and progress. Drawing from Julia Cameron's approach for writers, the article suggests an exercise involving self-reflection to overcome these barriers. By understanding their automatic tendencies and cultivating the right mindset, entrepreneurs can tackle demanding tasks with greater confidence and achieve success in their ventures.

## SCqA v0.2 

* SCqA - Situation - Analysis paralysis is a situation of when people justify stopping the analysis work and focus on what appears to be pragmatic, where learning can happen as things move, it is real as a device, has good intentions. 

* SCqA - Complication - The generalization of the possible action - of avoiding analysis - can become a device, a thought-tool, used in all sorts of circumstances. Not many talks about what comes before Analysis Paralysis, such as fear and control. 

* Different - This article takes a different approach to the concept of "analysis paralysis" compared to typical discussions. It recognizes the importance of being in the right mindset for progress and incorporates a writing exercise from Julia Cameron to foster self-reflection. By embracing this approach, entrepreneurs can overcome challenges more effectively and strike a balance between preparedness and action.

Some activities naturally pose a challenge to initiate. Imagine, as an entrepreneur, if you had to redesign your sales process, devise a new strategy, or reflect about the culture in the early stage of your start-up. These tasks often carry expectations and elicit strong emotions as our minds gear up for thoughtful analysis. Well, not really. If an activitity ahead is taken as not important, the natural reaction might be to ignore it in formal terms, quite strong, although of course a definite move firm after the feeling of certainty. 

Indeed, we naturally gravitate towards tasks where we feel we have a firm grip on the steering wheel. These are the activities where we're in control, where we can clearly see the road ahead and navigate the journey at our own pace. Yet, when it comes to other activities, such as challenging where how do to and results can't be measured, we might feel anxiety, or fear, or a sense that it won't progress. For that, we do have good reasons, such as the desire to be safe. We want to be prepared for these kinds of activities. The idea of progressing through planning and analysis isn't as straightforward as following a recipe even when it is labor-intensive. In other words, is more comfortable to run on the gas pedal when we don't have to review the road map or even the trip strategy. 

With this openning, it is not that we entirely give up doing things that requires redesign. It is just that we want to be in a good position, to be in the right mood, to be prepared, ready, and having things sorted out. This situation plagues all sorts of professionals, but especially the roles that involves leadership such as of entrepreneurs. 

### Search for reasons for timeless 

Furthermore, the notion of "analysis paralysis" frequently resonates in our minds, embodying the fear that we may become so wrapped up in overthinking and overanalyzing that we end up immobilized, incapable of making decisions or taking action. This fear can amplify our anxiety and the perceived necessity to be 'in the right mood' to tackle these demanding tasks. While the real situation of analysis paralysis can indeed be debilitating, the prevalence of this concept in discussions and self-reflections often heightens the apprehension about engaging with tasks that seem to be complex. It's essential to distinguish between the phenomenon that gave rise to the concept - of analysis paralysis - and the rhetorical device it has become, often used to accentuate the fears and which challenges the execution of important tasks. 

Conclusion? We need to be in the right position to advance, in a good mood, in a positive emotional state, and the readiness condition in general, that gives us more control towards the outcome. But to get out of this need that prevents us from advancing more complex reflections, and in the pursuit of a solution, it is need to emphasize the value, in the first place, of the exercise of reflection on this automatic tendency of ours. Furthermore, it is worth considering Julia Cameron's idea for the situation of writers - which can shed light for entrepreneurs. The exercise that Julia suggests consists of writing - for example for 10 minutes - about what is on your mind, some concern, for instance, a lack of preparation. From there, try to write for another 5 minutes about how your mood towards the activity has changed. She asks us to make a sort of report on the experience.

Research: Look for the specific part in "Maslow on Management" where Abraham Maslow compares and contrasts the mindsets of a controller and a creative individual. Understand the context and implications of this comparison.

Analysis: Analyze the tension between trying to control the outcome of potentially risky unknown tasks and the subsequent pull towards this mindset. Consider how this tension might lead to the anxiety, expectation, and need to "be in the mood" before initiating certain tasks.

Connection: Investigate how Maslow's work supports the concept of needing to be in a certain mindset or mood to tackle challenging tasks. Draw connections between his theories and the ideas presented in your writing.

Not unlike, it also happens in the life of writers, as illustrated by Julia Cameron (1998) in 'The Right to Write'. It is a phenomenon that plagues all sorts of professionals, especially those in leadership or entrepreneurial roles.

## Conclusion 

As interpersonal relationship arises, feedback systems chimes in. We gotta be driven by and free of. And going back to values of higher-order goals, going back to values of a system that gives people opportunity to grow, are important aspects to nurture time for. Thus, it is the responsibility of the entrepreneur and the executive team to deal with this, to use time for this, mapping, unbundling, being a critic and being a growth mentor, giving permission too, openning protective spaces of bets and separating risk analysis. 

As an aside of the phenomenon, I ask us to go back to that extremme situation pointed: how easy it is to get approved anything that supports values, such as the values that we have captured and perceived, and conversely how difficult we make for strategic ideas to get in our way. I will close with the situation of writers: If I happen to become good in writing in English, as in grammatically correct, I might value that to a point that wouldn't allow myself to write poorly in terms of grammar. But what if writing poorly, or more freely, were the closest path to finding something beautiful and meaningful. To close, entrepreneurship is like writing.
