# Important vs. urgent

* The following is somewhere else - search for p.178

* Abe maslow, p.178 - for Maslow, a question of time and time span affects collaboration and management. The illustration is of an environment where quick decisions are needed. In this situation, the superior (in the case of maslow a player that is superior in Intelligence) have a tendency to make decisions quick, to be directive, authoritative and to not allow room for discussion. It's an urgent agenda with no time for redesigning, possibly allowing actions such as harvesting or applying the potential that is on the table. On the other hand, there could be a situation that more time is allowed, thus in this scenario the superior can act differently. In this case, Maslow considered the building of a business to last for 50-100 years. In such protected frame, the dynamics of the group could be different and tending to the participative front, even in the condition of a natural unbalance with superiority of manager amid subordinates. If the time range is higher, such as if we extrapolate to the point of the need for a manager to find its sucessor, then the authoritativeness approach may become different, such as it may have better chances to tend to the manager approach as pointed by Andy Grove, the manager as an educator for example.

* Maslow adds, p.178, "this is a little like saying again that the ideal management policies are best under good conditions in a good world for management of good people. " And "If we had a peaceful, one-world society in which there were none of the present emergencies and in which we could patiently work toward the improvement of mankind, then the more participative management would be more desirable, even under this special condition of admitted superiority. "
