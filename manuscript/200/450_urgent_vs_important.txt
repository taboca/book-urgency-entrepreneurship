* Abe maslow, p.178 - for Maslow, a question of time and time span affects collaboration and management. The illustration is of an environment where quick decisions are needed. In this situation, the superior (in the case of maslow a player that is superior in Intelligence) have a tendency to make decisions quick, to be directive, authoritative and to not allow room for discussion. It's an urgent agenda with no time for redesigning, possibly allowing actions such as harvesting or applying the potential that is on the table. On the other hand, there could be a situation that more time is allowed, thus in this scenario the superior can act differently. In this case, Maslow considered the building of a business to last for 50-100 years. In such protected frame, the dynamics of the group could be different and tending to the participative front, even in the condition of a natural unbalance with superiority of manager amid subordinates. If the time range is higher, such as if we extrapolate to the point of the need for a manager to find its sucessor, then the authoritativeness approach may become different, such as it may have better chances to tend to the manager approach as pointed by Andy Grove, the manager as an educator for example.

* Maslow adds, p.178, "this is a little like saying again that the ideal management policies are best under good conditions in a good world for management of good people. " And "If we had a peaceful, one-world society in which there were none of the present emergencies and in which we could patiently work toward the improvement of mankind, then the more participative management would be more desirable, even under this special condition of admitted superiority. "

Situation is that urgent works better as it performs better. What is under the Eisenhower Matrix, important vs. urgent, is that the important generally has a cost to get to a point of performance, thus it involves learning. Let's consider the complication of what prevnts us to embrace and how to help ourselves to be open. 

### Story of the imperfect dishwashing machine and opportunity 

I have written the following letter to editors of a publication

```
Hi editors, 

A draft for an article for your consideration - The Dishwasher Machine Management Problem. When I say consideration, I am not forcing anything. Just sharing. I know that this is simple, it might be more like an outline. 

### The Dishwasher Machine Management Problem

A lot of people in Brazil refuse to invest in a dishwasher. The reasoning is this: When I wash the dishes, I reflect; it's not that hard. If I get a machine, I have to buy new dishes, change my habit, accept that I have to organize everything perfectly inside, and even pre-clean the dishes. I get mad because it feels like I am working for the machine. And all this to gain, in total, 10 minutes instead of doing it by hand.

Such reasoning makes lots of sense: The machine will do a job very poorly. That machine comes with a mediocre process that costs a lot - a dishwashing machine in Brazil costs 2-3 minimum wage salaries.

Now the dishwasher machine problem is a problem of management. A team manager is tied to the routine, managing the system, accelerating, or pausing its components.

Not much consideration is given to upgrading the process with " a new machine" such as a human resource. At this moment, many excuses will show up, just like the excuses that justify not incorporating that mediocre machine in the process.

But that 10min gain, which received lots of no-go reasons, can be the opportunity for major gains. Consider when a manager adds an intern, for example: Yes, the dishes will need to be adapted, and it might offer a 10-minute, like that mediocre machine.

But similarly to the opportunity of using that extra 10 minutes to do something useful in the kitchen, the manager - and its team - will be able to support that new working piece to improve its maturity.

The difference between the dishwashing machine and your human resource is that the human resource wants to grow if you give her a chance.

PS: Could connect with Andy Grove on Task Relevant Maturity

ChatGPT comparisons with the case pointed by Melissa of managers hiring senior 

```
Misunderstanding the Integration Process:

[1] People resist investing in a dishwasher thinking it's simpler to continue doing things manually. But even when they buy one, they realize there's a learning curve to using it efficiently.
[2] Managers often feel it's arduous to onboard new team members, so they opt for hiring more senior personnel thinking it'd be easier. However, even the senior individuals require a period of adjustment.
Underestimating the Onboarding Process:

[1] Dishwashers might save only 10 minutes of manual washing time, but they come with their own set of instructions and requirements (e.g., organizing dishes, pre-cleaning).
[2] Hiring senior personnel doesn't eliminate the need for onboarding. Every new team member, regardless of their seniority, requires time to understand the organization and its processes.
Cost vs. Value:

[1] Dishwashers in Brazil are expensive, costing 2-3 minimum wage salaries. People weigh this high cost against the perceived marginal gain in efficiency.
[2] Hiring senior personnel might be costly in terms of salary, but managers expect an immediate return in terms of productivity and efficiency, which might not be realistic.
Potential for Growth and Improvement:

[1] The analogy hints at the idea that if one properly utilizes the saved 10 minutes, it can be put to other productive uses in the kitchen.
[2] By properly onboarding and training a new hire, even if they are an intern or junior member, there's potential for significant growth and contribution to the team.
Resistance to Change vs. The Need for Thoughtful Integration:

[1] People resist changing their dishwashing habits, even if a machine could potentially make the task more efficient.
[2] Managers sometimes resist the idea of onboarding new team members, hoping to bypass the process by hiring senior personnel. However, thoughtful onboarding is essential for everyone.
