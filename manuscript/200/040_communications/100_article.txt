# In peace with communication

Everything we do in the business world we do so with what seems to be normal communications. In this active current, we can't hold what passes by - the form, shape and size, sometimes told, written or presented. We seem fine in this flow, even when too many people are making too many problems. What is not confusing through - especially in the startup setting - is an inclination to not invest in communications. It seems unnecessary, if not wrong, like an specialization that does not fit the genenalist needs. Let us reflect about the cost we pay for living with normal communications, reconsider why communications matters, and consider an organized approach where communications can be fundamentally be used to enrich the team bringing them clarity and more opportuties everyday.

 --> 

In the entrepreneurial setting, communication exists to cause change, such as to get a proposal approved, to offer a viewpoint about a situation that needs attention, to explain how something works, and a lot more. With that, we necessarily include target audiences. From there, we ask their attention. And then, we invite them collaborate. With that, we aim to be closer to our goals.

* outline - introduction - scqa/situation - Normal communication moves with the agile flow  
 --> 

But as the day goes by, the team communicates with good intentions to move needle further. Through that, if the audience gets confused, or if objections are raised, these are nuisances and quite legitimate. As an example, if an investor asks the team to stop before they get to the point. But effects are seen as the price to pay for a process that involves learning and failure. In other words, what has to be told has to be told and if it things aren't heard as expected, then that means valuable feedback and motivation to course-correct. Through this cycle, the team incessantly works to let it go what does not work and creatively fix up what works better; which goes well through the agile tracks of the modern startup. Therefore, we don't expect much of this normal communication. It is not that our communication is failing and it may be even good that through failures, through hopping, we are in fact incessantly using communication to solve failure, or to fail faster towards a successful station. With that, we prioritize what we can see as logical, the dynamics, such as our movement through the bushes, our effort to uncover the truths such as the data that proves and the arguments that forms the narrative. With these goggles, we trust that communication finds a way - like life finds a way - because effort comes first - because it all looks like a jungle with all sorts of uncertainties an adversities.

* outline - introduction - scqa / Complication - We overlook communications of the marketing 
 --> 

Now, that viewpoint is a complication preventing teams to find better ways to organize, or manage, their communications; under the assumption that better communications is something political, such as that it promotes, convices, persuades; while that normal communications is more honest to the needs of the average day. That view also pushes teams to overlook communications, even to a point of thinking that it is wrong - like an evil act. With that view, they are expected to prioritize some other works which they assume to be valuable, such as finding value to customers, such as coming up with the proofs, such as prototyping, concretizing some of their thesis. With that, again, they do think that they are using communications, or normal communications, which takes us to ignore any possible opportunities to manage communications. By this denial of managing communications, to seek an organized approach to communications, they miss the opportunity of using communications in a more helpful and honest way to the needs of the startup, as it is developed. With that, we continue to communicate in inneficcient ways, to confuse our teams, our audiences, and the many others in our ways. What is even worse is that, as we ignore investing in communication - and yet use communication to get something of them - we favor focusing on reasons to convince, such as going find the data, which puts pressure on the team, such as to excessively, if not obsessive, try to add value to what is being communicated, that can even take them to misuse data as a convincing mechanism.

To support founders to value communication throughout the whole process, we will start with a reflection of how we run with communications, or normal communications. Next, we will move to why this normal communication affects everything we do, such as the too many interactions that startups do with their multiple audiences, and some of the risks of overfocusing in our obsession with the value with a disregard to the coherence of communication with our audiences. And finally, you will be introduced to a organized model that will help teams to manage their communications and effectively use across all the stages - an approach referred as *Executive Communications* that is key to change the life of the startup. 

## Running with normal communications

* title: Running with normal communications 
--> 


From one communication to another there seems to have different ways of doing it, like as if some people do it with style. Some people struggle with the effort but somehow put out their ideas in a relatively clear, although not persuasive. Others struggle in the work and rework but nothing sticks. But there are the others that gets in the stage, and on that to be followed by the limelight, and swiftly say things that appear as just right, in the right moment and place, and with that these same folks appear to effortlessly and quite softly, or brutally, silence others thoughts even the ones with better ideas. In other words, there are communicative experiences that sounds better, that flows better, that sounds coherent. And our hopes are that these communicators are also coherently speaking the truths. 

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.1  \___ We are #detectors of #persuasion #evil 
--> 

But one thing is to be able to control this *special thing* about communications; and the other thing is to detect when we hear that. That is to say that we can detect when communication wants to be persuasive. Besides being able to notice, some of us may also dislike this kind of communication - or the ways of persuasivenees - as it seems to be powerful and in some cases evil. As I was having coffee when starting this article, I caught a fragment of a voice message from a passing pedestrian. He said "What did you think of my idea? Although it is not the best idea, what do you think?". Having detected that fragment, I thought that he was trying to aleviate a potential objection - that is not the best idea - from the other side. So he offered a shortcut to an outstanding decision as in saying that "we won't have the time to pick the perfect idea; so let's move on with this one." With that view in mind, thinking that he had put a frame to persuade while not providing substance, I kept my views that communication can be evil which is why I tend to dislike communications.  

But after a reflection, I realized that my judgment came from the fears that such kind of communication has the power to convince, that it could be dangerous by its power, like when some of the nuances presented can affect situations where people are in a hurry, or under pressure. But what if what was said were expected by the other person? As an example if his manager, on the other end, had replied "I agree." It could be that his manager wanted to hear that because she had asked for a pragmatic solution the day before. In that case, it would be then that what was said was said in right time. Conversely, my analysis had changed and allowed me to recognized that he had respected his audience, that he had acknowledged the "why am I here" question from his audience, and that he had acknowledged the outstanding complication expressed by her. Conversely, by imagining a favorable context, I accepted that the possibility that his communication were persuasive and honest.

* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.2  \___ Normal communications like tools, marketing  
--> 

But one way or another, in my view, these fragments of communication were serving a purpose, such as convince, or to sell, as if the communication an immutable thing serving to the purposes of an immutable need. Just like a communication about a car that exists after the fact that the car is produced and for the purpose of selling. This inclination, when it happens, feeds my lack of interest for working in communication, such as to manage communications, such as to use communications for the needs of the average day. As in the more I see communication like the wrapping paper, the more I continue to ignore investing in communication - until the moment is right. This can be a problem for entrepreneurs, as the moment that isn't right happens all the time while communication is happening, by the hour. 

### Doing analysis 

<!--

* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.x  \___ Dealing with communication in retrospect (consider)
--> 

But even though if communication is generally perceived as a ready-made thing needed in a transactional world, still the judgements during the communicative experiences are quite strongly observed. To illustrate the rise a critic style, consider an episode where I went to the supermarket, at the deli section which usually a place I care due to my Italian origins. There, a lady were there to help and we were there to buy mozzarella cheese, we needed about 7 ounces. But as we were ordering, she suggested us to buy a package with 7 ounces of mozzarella and 7 ounces of prosciutto, pointing out that in the combo the mozzarella was cheaper. Although we were in a hurry, and not there to reflect about ways people communicate, we didn't miss the basic math and asked her how much was the difference - to which she said 25 Brazilian Reais the normal price and 18 in the combo, therefore cheaper. Indeed, the basic math worked, she smiled, and said that she was there to help. But then I asked about the cost for the prosciutto to which she said to be about 13. At this point I felt confused because she didn't say that the prosciutto in the combo would rise to 18. So being there, logically not hungry, I've told her that the prosciutto in the combo was sold at a higher price. She smiled, said again that she was there to help, but this time also added that I could either accept it or not. Having observed the love of my life waiting for the interaction, I decided to keep the marriage, enjoy the Saturday, and move on - although I had to imagine myself kicking the shelf. We picked the pricey prosciutto with the cheaper mozzarella.

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.4  \___ Abstraction that communications serve urgent needs  
--> 

This more elaborated fragment shows a mechanism that exists to serve a potential need, like an urgent need of sales, and a potential need of the audience. Therefore, take aside right or wrong, it certainly shows persuasiveness, although at the risk of failing after the fact-checking. But it also shows that there are situations when some of us may wear a hat, like me, where we engage a defense mechanism against a potentially evil communication, where the math matters, where fact-checking matters, which involves a process of checking if what was said which sounds coherent comes with data that supports. 

<!-- 

note: Marcio had written, in a note about the above, that a paradox was evidenced. I have no idea of this paradox, perhaps worth to consider. 

--> 

Now, the point is that we favor rationality, the fact-checking mode of operation. It is not to say that we ignore communication and the aspects of coherence. We do recognize it, and in fact may do so quite well, like we recognize when that sort of train comes, on time, when the sound of induction comes our way, like the sound of a train arriving which prompts us to enter it. But as we do so, we also tend to see if it carries the cargo, if value has in its wagons. In other words, the more we see fast trains of thought carrying useless cargo, the more we are inclined to engage in the - quite needed process of - analysis which suggest to us that communication aspects, the train, is not as important, that can be secondary. Which is not, by the way, a bad mechanism to exist, although from the needs of this chapter, it does not help much. 

### Focusing on good reasons

* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.2.1  \_____ Focusing on good reasons - Creators do that    
* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.2.2  \_____ Focusing on good reasons - Convincing the translators
--> 

Now, if people go away from being persuasive, they might do so with an inclination that it adds nothing, if not it could be an investment misleading themselves. One in that position, such as an entrepreneur, could fear to look like a salesman in hurry and intended to convince in bad ways which disregard value. But even if they consider to invest in communication responsibly, still it might be a problem with folks like creators, makers, engineers, and whoever looks at things from a logical, or a systems-oriented mindset. These folks may see themselves as supporters, responsible for the actual cargo, the values, what matters. They might also love deduction, to prove, to come up with the how-to, to work with more logical and structured ideas, to fill out the details with truths, and the like. This is quite evident in the situation of entrepreneurs as, of course, they love and want to express their ideas, and they recognize the importance of being understood by audiences in a way that make moves forward. But still, they rather use their time to focus in the inner works, or inner proofs, and the supporting elements that makes ideas to become good solutions. 

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.2.2  \_____ Focusing on good reasons - Convincing the translators
--> 

Therefore, while there is an acknowledgement that focusing in communication helps with the grease required that makes everything moving smoothly, still higher importance is given to the works for things like substance, truths, or data, which are the gears of the working machines. In other words, their job becomes the duty of trying to convince the communication folks, the translators. And as they focus a lot on trying to prove things, when they win an acknowledgedment, they can get so excited that it all makes sense, which contributes even more to ignore the possibility that they didn't needed to show as much to prove if they had worked better in the actual communication. In other words, when proof is given to a point that the magic click happens, such as "Now I got and thanks for the prototype," a potential for a post-mortem analysis for how communication happens is dead. 

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.2.3  \_____ Focusing on good reasons - Perception that it is marketing tied
--> 

Now, there are many reasons why to focus first in value, second in communication, and it is generally quite valid. One other example might have to do understanding that the roles that focus more on coherence, the ones concerned with the audience and interested in persuading them, might not generally understand what is up and coming, such as what is new and innovative. A major reason for that is that these folks are too tied with the needs of the audiences, thus they can be representative of the market needs, be pressured by the market. Thus, given that what is outstanding might not be yet fully meaningful to the audience, the role of the expert communication would either not get it or force the offering to be appealing, which can be seen by the one working in the value to be a not so honest movement. This might be yet another reason supporting the lack of interest in communication, keeping the doers to believe in what they believe without changing the underlying assumption - supported by an unshakable faith - which sets them to try to solve communication needs not with one arm but with both arms tied behind their back.

--> 

Now, in the corporate setting, no one tells the communicator-doer that they are being observed that they are failing with communication, that their failures are okay, that they can invest and grow with communicative experiences, that they could fail, and fail, and learn, and improve their communication skills, such as to achieve clarity and to be able to communicate better with their colleagues and audiences. Although the executive level, such as the CEO or a anyone in a senior position, are in a good position to recognize that as a truth, it is rarely told to the doers. It maybe so due to fear, such as fear that talking about one's writing, or one's communication, would offend or sound like harassement. 

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.3.2    \_____ Managerial supported - Managers are bad critics
--> 

On top of that, goes the fact that senior people, are not good critics to support communicative experiences, that they grew up in a space where they would - in case they expose their criticism - do more in terms of criticizing with an orientation to the eyes of their maturity levels, such as involving the prism of expecting outcomes, which would naturally bring about the sort of product or market oriented critics, not the critics that promotes learning and advancement, which would be considered for them not even a critics, but more like mentorship. Their level, their position, the the moment where a potential willingness to be a critic comes about, is not even a moment for educating, for motivating, for looking at potential value. It's more like a review to avoid risks. Then, with that, nothing is done. You are on your own. 

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.3.3    \_____ Managerial supported - Think broken equals to collaboration
--> 

Another aspect, to not touch communication investment for the subordinate, is that the process is more collaborative, and that the communication will rise anyway. Thus, in the face of any potential side impact of the focus in works towards value, or valuing arguments more than coherence, which takes a long ride - as we can be spending time, attention, interest, getting frustrated, burning our attention and effort to try to make sense of things - it is generally taken as the cost and where collaboration happens. 

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.3.4    \_____ Managerial supported - Managers are translators
--> 

Another factor is that management plays a role in communication from a translation perspective. In other words, managers are in between the tops-down concerns, representing or translating the higher-level interests under a solutions-oriented perspective, and the bottoms-up concerns where the systems-orientation are considered critical. 

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K1.3.5    \_____ Managerial supported - People growth and specialize
--> 

Thus, under the pressure of the normal corporate space, the roles might indeed gravitate for one or other side where generally some people better with communication seems to move towards the solutions-oriented space where some people better with creation seems to move to the systems-oriented space while some people are translators. To point an example, if a manager sees a subordinate doing a good job in the fields of productization, like prototyping, he would be likely to allow that subortinate to invest their own time to overperform in improving the prototype the demo day. In other words, managers will be more comfortable to identify and recognize the growth of individuals as they gravitate towards one or other end.

--> 

Now, the above consideration that *Running with normal communications* isn't in any way an evidence that we ignore communications. As an example, if we care to check the things being told, we do so because we are trying to be conscious. And if we favor rationality, such as going after the good reasons, we do so because of our interest to make our narratives truthful. In other words, we know that communications matters, a lot. It matters so much that we deal with fixing communication that way, through a collaborative environment where our narratives are constructed as the day goes by. 

<!--

With that said, it appears an inclination that we course-correct communications after we communicate. 


With that said, let us consider reasons why Communication happens more by reflecting about side effects of the normal communications in the average day. One being a reflection about the ongoing and endless frustration that set many of us to be mad such as when they don't get the endless meetings only after a lot of endless meetings have happened. And also, from the other side of the spectrum, when we seem to react to fix the broken communications by going straight to use, and abuse, with data.

But all that happens in the corporate space is being written anyway, even if not well-written or formal. All that happens flows and fills the whole story, of the corporation, the team, or the startup. The late writing professor William Zinsser, in On Writing Well, help us to visualize how modern writing is not different from the old piece of paper:  

> *"Although this book is about writing, it's not just for writers. It's principles apply to everyone who is expected to do some writing as part of his or her daily employment. The memo, the business letter, the admistrative report, the financial analysis, the marketing proposal, the note to the boss, the fax, the e-mail, the Post-it - all the pieces of paper that circulate through your office everyday are forms of writing."* (Zinsser, 2006, p. 165) 

<!--

* reference - Zinsser, W. (2006). On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction (7th ed.). Harper Perennial.
--> 

But although our letters are smaller and the frequency of exchange higher, we shouldn't underestimate what is being written. Although these fragments appear harmless, the cadence and pathways adds to the current downstream. A few chapters back, in the *Book of Marcio Lost in Translation*, I felt swept away by what seemed to be evil words. Although my English were poor, the valley seemed sunny and welcoming. As the meeting unfolded, I threw a "bada big bada bum, korben, bada bum big bada bum." But to my surprise, a crisp and clear English was thrown by the local manager that started with "But more importantly,.." I don't recall what happened next but everybody agreed.  

That incident was remarkably confusing to me. I kept asking why it felt like evil? I kept thinking that "he drew first blood, not me." Now, far from that injustice to my hopes, I see that he had a duty to keep the meeting that way, like a sherif of a little town. But sadly, whatever happened that day had delayed my involvedment with communication, and more importantly had blurred my vision to see communications as a friendly tool and not as a weapon.

There is also another story that has happened at the same sunny company which sometimes seemed like a jungle. This time I were part of a a team where they called themselves web monkeys. Our mission were to help implement new color themes to help relaunching their web mail service. In order to do that, as web monkeys, we had to edit a lot of files, one for each theme, and for each one, replace the old color codes with a new color code. If we were really monkeys it would be like climbing in 16 different trees and, for each tree, paint the color of its leafs. As the task would demand a lot of "monkey work," I came up with an insight to automate part of the monkey job. Quite excited with my approach, I tried to tell them althought my explanation came up like "What if we come up with one new tree where all the leafs are replaced to bananas.  With that, we can then clone the trees 16 times and run a code that can replace bananas with the color we want." I don't recall the specifics of the complex explanation I gave them but I am certain that I had used "banana" as the example of a color. So I tried that and didn't work, the team were looking at me. Then I went to the white board to try again, it didn't work again. Then, when I was to try again in another quite arbitrary way, my manager told me to "not bring that idea again." I got frustrated, a bit mad, and feeling silenced in front of the team. But the worse was really my frustration that I could not give the idea in a way they could understand - an idea that would help them in fact. As soon as I left the room, however, an impulse took me straight to the office of a software engineer that I knew. I had asked help to him and he had created the script a couple days later. Eventually, things worked and the team had accepted our contribution. 

It may be that what had happened could be considered good news - that all of that supports the idea that we can use a normal kind of communications, that things are okay, that life finds a way, workers finds a way, the team can get away. Or that in the end of the day, we say how we way, and by the misunderstandings we course-correct to achieve clarity for things, as we break things. Therefore, it is quite acceptable that my manager might have asked that as I was trying again and again and wasting the team's time. And as yet another plus, perhaps I didn't do too bad, especially considering that the other engineer had the time to give to me, first to listen, then to interpret, then to reflect, then to do the work which of course delayed him from doing the work he were to do, although he may have allowed that as he saw a potential - such as to save the monkeys - and likely he might have done in his own extra time, like in his house, which would be then incurr a potential loss to his family, which I hope it was an acceptable.

But while I didn't miss my manager's being a bit brutal to me, what I missed was what to do about that. In other words, I kept doing what I were doing, I kept being quite arbitrary when giving people my ideas, the propositions. I would now say that I was giving them the bits and pieces of how I see things, assuming that they would follow along. I now see too my own tendency to use a narrative style of communication where I tend to explain the reasoning that I am using to arrive at the idea; and worse which is to assume that this approach works or that it is the only way to communicate. In retrospect, it is fair to consider that I didn't had the tools to communicate better, that I didn't know which direction to go. And if any solution were to be considered, these seemed to be quite limited and confined to improving the general idea of improving communications, which I think were linked to the fact that I also didn't speak and write English fluently. So most of us, at the time, like colleagues and friends, would simplify as English communication or some sort of related training. I had a hint, tough it was not clear too, where I would tell my Silicon Valley friends that my friends in Brazil would not understand me either. The response to that, unfortunatelly, was to dismiss the subject as a sort of joke. 

Now, in retrospect and looking at the area of skill development, I came accross *The Conscious Competence model* [^footnote_model_four_stages_competence] when I got involved in the *Learning How to Learn* [^footnote_course_learning_how_to_learn] course by  professors Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. This model, often attributed to Noel Burch since 1970s, helped me to understand that our unawareness about the areas we don't know can limit our options for what to do, such as to consider to invest in the areas that we are conscious about our incompetence. The model helps us to a new perspective by considering the four stages, or psychological states, in the journey from ignorance to mastery of a skill: Unconscious Incompetence, Conscious Incompetence, Conscious Competence, and Unconscious Competence. When the professors asked us to fill out the quadrants, I caught myselfin in a puzzle, when I had to fill out the areas that I needed to improve. I have noticed the quite odd observation that improving communication appeared in both Unconscious incompetence and Conscious incompetence. But reflecting on that was the origins to improve my sense of being humble, in other words to recognize that I don't know what I don't know. With that, it reveals the complexity which is the case with learning communications when one can think that they know what to do next. In my case, English seemed to be a barrier so it obviously suggested to us, or created an illusion, that the investment needed had to be related to English, or business English, or communications. Sadly, all of us at the time didn't know, as we were unconscious of our incompetence, of an enlighted view that could help us to organize the thinking before communications - which we will experience soon as we approach the section entitled Executive Communications. 

[^footnote_course_learning_how_to_learn]: The "Learning How to Learn" course, led by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, is a popular Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered on Coursera. It aims to give students tools and techniques to master complex subjects and understand how learning works from a neuroscientific perspective. 

[^footnote_model_four_stages_competence]: In the Four Stages of Competence model, individuals progress through four stages of learning: Unconscious Incompetence, Conscious Incompetence, Conscious Competence, and Unconscious Competence. This framework helps understand the process of learning and acquiring new skills, from initial unawareness to effortless proficiency.

--> 

There are the kind of people that love to transform ideas into things, aiming for what looks real, and that behavior may sustain their proposals even if they don't care for communication in formal ways. But then under the condition of being certain that they can't focus in persuading, they are left with the tools they have. Therefore, they use critical thinking, and logic, and do the design work, and research, and find data. 

But the confusing thing about that inclination is that, really, sometimes a prototype can prove, sometimes a full proof is given, this is the beautiful side which confuses us under their ability to do it good, with professionalism, with the intent high, and when purpose exists, and even in a world where no one understand, if they have resources.

--> 

I have a story, which can be a beautiful illustration but also an opportunity to reflect about when a situation of overestimating the data, the numbers, the materializations; which can become quite normal behavior of a mechanized world of work. Many of my colleagues recognized the work of my life of a prototyping developer which is surely a quite modern role - if you think of one that can work by creating things that are not complete. In retrospect, I can see clearly that my inclination as a prototyper might have been bosted by my fears to become a communicator, which started quite early. Anyway since I happed to be 10-years old when personal computers came along, and I loved to draw, then I end up learning about life through user interfaces first which pushed me to be around to work with web pages in the nineties, which pushed me to get a job as a technology evangelist for some of the early web browser vendors. But I carried on, my frustrations with communication plus my aversion to the communications of the typical salesperson that lies to sell. But then, being decades and decades around software developers, it took me a lot to get into the full realization that even software developers - that think of themselves as honest communicators -  are can also lie with their materializations. I happened to do that once, right when I was doing my internship at Netscape. Because I happened to be working with animations and web pages and my role was as an evangelist, to promote the technology. Thus, things seemed to convince by the visual elements. Since these visual productions looked good, and our browser product was being launched, I happened to be invited to make the Welcome Page of the new version of the browser. And into that, instead of making only the actual image of the expected visual result, I end up developing the Welcome Page implementing it using quite a few resources that were quite early, not fully complete and ready to be used. One idea I had was to make the name of the product, Netscape, to be on the horizon and an illusion of a calm ocean under it, so that creating an illusion of a reflection. To do that, and with limited resources in terms of visual effects, I had decided to create multiple copies of the Netscape name, and for each one I had clipped horizontally, a big part of the text, leaving just a line, like a strikethrough, but only the strikethrough part of it visible, positioning the line, and positioning each text in reverse order under the text so the result looked like the reflection of the text. If that wasn't enough I had then decided to animate each line following a sine wave, being that the far line would move with a short movement and for each line an a larger movement. The final effect was an illusion of waving. Imagine the following picture with that reflection: 

![Image of welcome page](images/200/netscape-6.png)

Then, all seemed to be nice, and the internship ended. And I left back to Brazil and I was quite busy trying to complete University so a couple months later I had noticed that the welcome page wasn't that one. And later I heard that it crashed the browser, badly. Now, of course, this is Silicon Valley; so no one would blame anyone me for crashing the browser, for using the very resources supposed to work. Still, I confess that didn't have a judgement - or actually the means - to see if that production would appropriate. Many of the team, under the break first fix later mentality, may have hurried to fix the browser instead. But from a wiser context, that page implemented like that would be a poor judgement from my side or a lack of context about objectives. My point is exactly to help us see that none of us are intentionally lying with numbers - but insted advancing with what drive us, projections, romantic or following the goals, under anxiety to deliver, you name it. Therefore, again, it is good if we can carry on a bit of the that Jeff Bezos style. 

Especially in the modern world of data that can be obtained with easy, and our abilities to prototype faster, the narratives that we build are now supported by the apparent materialization that we naturally use to support buyers, buyers like customers, investors, and ourselves. We get into buy-in, and with that we can advance things, but we also cry when it is time to refactor things. It's beauty and it is the best all together. My point though, is not to give up on our developer role but to recognize that the very approach of evolving ideas by quickly prototyping, or materializing, can be as good or as evil, just like a salespeople around because they don't tell, they show. And by climbing up that ladder of assumptions, and also narrative oriented illusions that seem quite real, thay may not even even notice when they lie as they lie to themselves by being involved with the perceived materialization of what they had in mind. 

But, as likely the by-product of going in that direction, they might also die before they have time to prove, part A. And if that is not enough what can be really tricky is that they may actual do a kind of work that is in a way like what the bad salesperson would do, although no evil is perceived; when they are inserting data enough to prove, although not quite intended as a conscious evil act but as they do, they materialize an evil with no awareness of it, even to a point that does worse than the salesperson that attempts to persuade with no given value offered exactly because that salesperson would be less likely to convince.

The realization of this phenomena, made be less mad with the hypothetical or real salesperson that deals with the pressures to sell and have no regard to his reputation with the customer. In other words, not all salespeople are liers, they can also be strong believers. Not all the financial people trying to please the executive are natural born liers. The situation of "you can lie with numbers very easily," comes naturally. Therefore, the systems-oriented folks can also enter the game of persuasion, however at another level, by overfocusing in trying to make their paintings to stand, such as my using an excessive amount of nails. Now, if they minimize their willingness to put mails, they are to face the "yet another test" against all the external folks they need help. It's a balance.

Growth machine demands the test

In the startup situation, anyone in the team is in a position where substance, such as value, has to be offered to others. The hope is that the exchange of value by them takes the startup into the next stage. It is also of the nature of the startup that things are promised to be delivered if value is given first. In other words, the founder may offer something, generally a communicative experience, which promotes the promising future. Then, on the side of the audience, someone in may agree - with a take my money - and will be expecting the promised value in return. In other words, their survival depends on communicating with these others. It is also the case that what is being offered might not be an offering. It may be some other benefit, though. You can get an idea of the various kinds of communications as we recognize that teams are issessantly communicating, not with arbitrary audiences but with others such as co-founders, customers, colleagues, partners, investors, and more. 

Now, by these insessant communications the team is trying to advance with their startups. They are testing if the audience listens, they are invinting them to engage, and they want one or other form of support from them. From the point of view of investors, consider the thought from Marc Andreessen [^footnote_marc_andreessen_tests] about why a formal presentation with investors is important and, at the same time, how it is a representation of a communication mechanism that should exist with many other audiences in the startup's way: 

[^footnote_marc_andreessen_tests]: Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (also known as a16z), is recognized as an investor in the technology startup sector. Andreessen Horowitz has garnered a reputation for its unique approach to venture capital, emphasizing not just financial investment but also providing strategic, operational, and management guidance to its portfolio companies.

Now, considering that startups deal with multiple audiences, with a product that doesn't fully exist, customers that are yet to be discovered, and not even a full picture of who to communicate with, any inclination to use communication as a tool at a later stage, such as a tool to promote, or to convince, goes against the major necessity where actively communication need to happen - in the course - for the sake of navigating with communication, and improving communication with the audiences.

This forces the communication experience to be serve the needs of growth, forces the holistic view of growth, forces transcendence, forces the entrepreneurs to move across the various levels of audiences, respecting them in the first place; and more importantly if communication happens to exist at all levels, such as the internal team, it also goes naturally away from manipulative communication that could take over, such as in conditions where communication appears as a solution of-the-shelf on top of a communication need with an audience. 

Therefore, looking from this angle, that tests are happening, working in communication for the sake of serving the tests have more to do with acessing the audiences other than gaming the system, and through those interactions, the opportunity to find clarity for the many elements involved such as values, vision, mission, product values, customer's problems, cofounders roles, investors's participations, and the why for everyone else invited to the conversation.

Now, we have considered that *Running with normal communications* and that *Communication happens more*. But still, any inclination to that destination will start by a major roadblock - that we still don't care if the road is not clear, safe, and does justice to the needs where communicative experiences are meaninful through the stages of growth and interactions with several audiences - themselves, customers, investors, to name a few.

Fortunately, an enlightening way exists, and will help us to manage communications. With that, I welcome you to the theme of Executive Communication (Heavybit, 2019), where we will be guided by Michael Dearing, of Harrison Metal [^footnote_harrisonmetal], and get to know remarkable work of Barbara Minto, the author of The Minto Pyramid Principle (2016) [^footnote_barbara_pyramid]. This the brief journey is less of a guide. I like to think of it as a new paradigm. What Michael asks us to celebrate, and what Barbara set herself to solve, solves the puzzle with communications. In Michael's talk (2019), he had illustrated the complication with a meme known as "How to Draw the Owl" [^footnote_meme_draw_the_owl] which brings about the sad reality of trying to learn about communication: 

[^footnote_harrisonmetal]: Instead of trying to describe the viewpoint from Harrison Metal's educational content for entrepreneurs, I took some of the phrases that are shown at the bottom of their web site: Harrison Metal is grateful for the business historians at Harvard Business School, Harrison Metal produces case studies to help businesspeople, Harrison Metal makes everything by hand, Sometimes it hurts, Harrison Metal likes when ideas from the past help us, Harrison Metal appreciates optimistic, frugal ambition, Harrison Metal thinks the best and worst of us live side by side, Harrison Metal thinks capitalism is a self-cleaning oven.

What is ahead of us is, first, the story of Barbara Minto set herself to fill that gap. I think that the story of Barbara is especially relevant because of her concern about communications had to do with finding a way to manage communication: 

> *"Interestingly, when I began researching materials on report writing, I discovered that while there were an enormous number of books on how to write better sentences and paragraphs, there were no books on how to organize the thinking those sentences and paragraphs are meant to convey."* (Minto, 1996, Preface).

<!--

--> 

But such interest and viewpoint had origins from Barbara's unique perspective long before she happen to be working to come up with a good theory. As Michael mentioned, Barbara was among the first 20 women admitted to Harvard Business School in the late 1950s. At that time, the school was 55 years old and already considered top-tier. Additionally, this first group of women were set in a more traditional lecture style in a separate classroom from the men. Therefore, Barbara was in a special section with her nine other colleagues. In addition, they were informed that if they finished in the top 10%, they could earn a spot alongside the men, across the river, in the next year. Adding to the challenge, Barbara's subject was macroeconomics. Plus, her last math class was 12th-grade.

When I watched that segment, I pondered the extremes: one to proceed to abandon everything, or, perhaps like the the man of Harvard of the time, to proceed to engage with the day's battles. But that wasn't Barbara's anyway. When Michael asked her, "What did you do?" she told him that as she began preparing notes from the textbook, she became angry. She told him that "It was so badly written. This person who wrote this textbook was keeping me from understanding this cool topic." (Heavybit, 2019). 

Now the watching of that talk also took me back to my own days in the university when I was studying Computer Science in Brazil in a well-regarded top-tier university. Most of us students knew that things were hard. We would never know what we would find ahead of us when the matter was to learn topics like math. We knew the amount of hours for the lectures but the unknowing of what it takes to learn - on the side - was frightening. So while I felt thoughts of suspiction about the ways the materials were given - or written - these thoughts were clouded by the storms of authority of a system that was too hard, with hard professors, and hard materials, where hard work was the way to survive. All that against the image that students were lazy. Now, looking in retrospect, I can't say I were in front of confusion through the things, as in if the materials were keeping me from understanding the cool topics. What we could tell, though, was that a handful of professors and authors were actually good at explaining things which made us learn the topics. These were exceptions. Now in retrospect I wonder - what if the better ones seemed great because comparatively the bad ones were just too bad?

But back to Barbara's day, her reaction were different - she faced the battle from a different angle. According to Michael, she "rewrote it, line by line, paragraph by paragraph, page by page, until she could teach the basic concepts of macroeconomics to her colleagues in the section" (Heavybit, 2019). Fast-foward from the origins, the result of her work took her to solving the problem, or that she had cracked the code of executive communication:  

> *"I worked at the Walt Disney Company for a man named Michael Eisner when he was CEO, and his deep religious conviction was that Barbara Minto had cracked the code on executive communication. He's not alone. If you go around the world and you talk to the most accomplished executive communicators, they are practicing a version of her framework called the Pyramid Principle"* Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019)

* outline - introduction - scqa / K3.1.1 -      \____ Okay with it, it might be right  
--> 

For me, as far and up to when I had found Barbara's work, I kept moving on generally looking at the things written wearing goggles where most things, written or presented, were right. Therefore, normally setting myself right into the battle, the struggle, and taking myself to be okay to assemble the puzzles, if not blaming myself for when things would not work, living the tension, or frustrations, through the misunderstandings. This phenomenon, such as of accepting what is presented as being right, and looking at myself as the one to solve, is perhaps a force that some people are fine with it. I always felt sort of proud of it and it reaches out beyond standard texts, such as with interfaces of digital systems. I was the other day working with my friend and we were trying to figure how to use a digital service through the software system that we had to develop. We spent about 30 minutes reading and trying out things and then, voilá, we had figured. It turned out that what was in front of us was too exciting - our chance to create a digital conversational chatbot [^footnote_chatbot] using an the online infrastructure of a major well-known service. When we achieved the moment pride, euphory took us over, we were excited; and I almost moved on as I used to do in many episodes as a software developer. But then, as we have a bit of time in the meeting, I had paused and told him that we just spent 30 minutes trying to read a poor documentation and trying to navigate through an ambigous interface that was not stable where most of its the texts to help were doing a dissservice. We sort of agreed that we wasted our time. But then, again, that is life, isn't it? Perhaps most developers are, in the end of the day, mainly moving on through the broken texts, and the broken interfaces, and with that they are the ones in a good position to be ahead in the game since after they cut the bushes from their path, they are the first to be able to use some good ideas, they still have it energy. Being that real or not, it is more real that the world of digital systems is so dynamic and the interfaces, and the texts that go along, are changing all the time, being writen in different ways, serving the urgencies of launching first, being clear later. 

But back to the main point, and more importantly and quite sadly, my own inclination to not pay attention to the fact that a lot of the struggle had to do with the clarity of texts, led me not only to wast energy, such as time, such as to be be confused with these materials; but worse, to be blaming myself and continuing to work for the situations, instead of asking myself - is this text clear? Is this interface clear? What I am doing here? And the like. Plus, and this is the sad news, the environment of being okay around all the broken documents, may have supported me to be okay with the producing broken documents, broken interfaces, broken communication, even though my broken documents had a nice example in the middle, sometimes. 

#### Searching for clarity 

<!-- 
@meta @todo 
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Communication - Consider the insight from Barbara Minto that can be applicable to the section where Marcio talks about communication being used to achieve clarity. The following quote should be considered on page 89 of the Minto pyramid principle under the chapter entitled imposing logical order. Consider the following quote, from p. 89: "The point I wish to reiterate is that you cannot tell that nonsense is being written on that unless you first impose a structure on it. It is the imposition of the structure that permits you to see the flaws and omissions." Further, in "summarizing grouped ideas," Barbara continues to trust the point that throught the development of the pyramid you are essentially discovering, iterating. Consider the following quote from p. 94: "In other words, the act of summarizing the groupings is the act of *completing the thinking*." @meta-refid 1222-3434-8383-8383

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Communication - Consider a quote from Barbara Minto, from page 73, Introduction to Part 2, Logical Thinking: "The tendency to list appears to be universal, and as a technique for getting a rough approximation of your thinking out where it can be looked at critically, it is fine. The trick is not to stop there, but to go further to make sure that the ideas in each grouping actually possess an intrinsic logic, and then explicitly to state the insight that that logical relationship implies.Looking critically at groupings of ideas requires hard work - indeed it is the essence of the thinking process - which is no doubt why it is so often ignored. But ignoring it means that you never quite say what you meant to your reader and - worse - you never quite grasp the essence of your thinking. That in turn not only wastes time and resources but, sadly, could mean you don't achieve all the major insights and breakthroughs in thinking that are possible." @meta-refid 1222-7373-4843-9877

--> 

Now, one thing is to consider the angle where more traditional texts, such as renowmed text books, lack the good order and clarity in ways that prevents the audience to understand. But the world has changed - not to say exploded - with too many formats, too many opportunities, and too many interactions happening in the average day. We are now pressured to read more, to write more, to exchange more messages. In other words, we more iteratively and interactively watch, read, reflect, and then we write or present or decide. All that in a faster pace, through online documents being shared, e-mails exchanged, text messages, conference calls, you name it. In other words, with more interaction and communicative happening, the lack of clarity in the everyday communications would lead to an explosion of problems. 

But the reason that things seem to be working - as opposed to a chaos - is that, as we have reflected, we do move on by using communicative experiences, and we recognize that as collaboration. Thus, the good news, is that it is by communicating in the ways we think of as communications, by collaborating in ways that we think as collaboration, that we are searching for clarity. That perspective also goes well with the agile nature of the modern methods of work, and with - as we have considered - the good managerial environment that is not only collaborative but also inclusive. 

Not coming back to the startup setting, we can first recount the situation where communicative experiences are happening like the grease in the machine not mattering the size. Two, that it exists to cause change through the interactions with audiences like stakeholders, cofounders, customers, and more. And three, that we have expressed a tendency of the doers in overlooking communication and instead overfocusing in the arguments, and reasons, going after data, collecting evidence, coming up with proofs, constructing systems, and the like. Because the sky is the limit, I will simplify and call it *Data*.

Now a question is, if the team favors *Data*, it means that the interaction with the audience will be effective? Imagine a team that builds and shows a prototype and a customer said "that is cool." Now, even if some customers like it, it still does not solve the needs of an investor as she might be interested in the business model, in the growth potential, any risks involved, if the team can productize the real version, and more. Now, a fair consideration must be made, that if this situation were real, such objection could be dismissed by the saying that "this is a problem we all want to have," which is a short version that acknowledges that the investor further interest has happened after the investor's recognigtion of the success with the customer.  

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K3.2.x -      \____ Retrospect? (confirm)
--> 

Therefore, it is a fair conclusion that the team's interest in affairs with the *Data* has less to do with their intention to come up with the offering and more of serving the needs to support good arguments, or good reasons, that supports a clear story that supports the more mature decisions ahead associated with the growth expectations, such as further investment. Therefore, if gambling is nothing like the self description of what entrepreneurs do when they come up with *Data*, then by the nature of the iterative and interactive process, we can fairly say that they are searching clarity; which is not much different from the corporate version where communicative experiences through collaboration helps with clarity. 

Now, this situation for searching for clarity can also be observed from the perspective of the doer working in the communication, like when one is writing. The following observation from Peter Drucker identifies that the problem of achieving clarity is not regarded as the problem with what people normally call communications: 

> *"There is a very old saying among writers: 'Difficulties with a sentence always mean confused thinking. It is not the sentence that needs straightening out, it is the thought behind it. In writing we attempt, of course, to communicate with ourselves. An unclear sentence is one that exceeds our own capacity for perception. Working on the sentence, that is, working on what is normally called communications, cannot solve the problem. We have to work on our own concepts first to be able to understand what we are trying to say - and only then can we write the sentence."* (Drucker, 2011, p. 6)

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* reference - Drucker, P. (2011). Technology, management, and society. Routledge.
--> 

Now, an observation must be made that the extremmes aren't good. On one hand, one that attempts to fix the communication in terms of sentences, instead of being busy with the concepts first. On the other hand, one that attempts to find *Data* and presenting it with no regard to the objectives to be achieved in the future. As entrepreneurs don't want to waste their time, such as gambling with data, and likewise aren't interested in wasting time straightening out sentences, then they should be busy with the effort to achieve clear thinking, to get the concepts rights. 

But then the question is - where to start? From the communicative experience or from the *Data* end? Well, from none of them but from the thing that holds all together which is the necessity to manage the communications. Consider, for example, the approach used by the late professor William Zinsser as he needed to help students who were struggling to write about science and technology subjects: 

> *"Describing how a process works is valuable for two reasons. It forces you to make sure you know how it works. Then it forces you to take the reader through the same sequence of ideas and deductions that made the process clear to you. I've found it to be a breakthrough for many students whose thinking was disordely."* (Zinsser, 2006, p. 148)

In other words, there are things with can do about communications, there are means that we can manage communications, such as models that can help us to approach communications. And, more importantly, there are models that are applicable to the specific situations, like the situations of entrepreneurs, or business people, or of audiences that have a solutions oriented mindset. One of these models is what I invite you to see next, through the teaser of Barbara's SCqA.

--> 

Now, the story of Barbara's journey in cracking the code of executive communication guides the doer to manage and design the communicative experience. Part of The Pyramid Principle involves the identification of a fundamental unit of logic that is quite applicable in business communications - in proposals, memos, reports, pitch to investors, and more. This unit of logic she called SCqA and stands for situation, complication, question, and answer. I like to think of Barbara's SCqA as a sort of contract for why the audience is there. It governs the relationship between the individuals involved in a communication, or the sides, or the entities, it honors the value-exchange of the relationship.

##### Situation 

> "The best executive communication starts with the state of affairs. It's fact based, unambiguous. It's totally not controversial. No matter what side of an issue or a hard choice you're on, you should be able to read the situation and go, 'That pretty much sums it up.' Whether you're on one side or another of an issue, it doesn't matter. You should read the situation and agree to it."  Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

##### Complication 

> "The next thing that comes out is the complication. A crisp, short statement about what has changed or what's making things harder. What's changed, what's making things harder? The question, the 'Q' falls automatically out of 'S' and 'C' and it's almost always 'What should we do?' You can save yourself a lot of anxiety if you're trying to practice this, if you get hung up on 'Q' it's almost always, 'What should we do?' 'Answer,' 'A,' answer first at the top of a pyramid." Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

##### Question and Answer 

> *"Pyramid-shape your evidence underneath it, and it has to resolve the complication 100 %. She is rigorously devoted to this framework. If you go ahead and buy that book, which I recommend you do, and you read it you're going to get halfway into it and go, "She really believes this." I'm here to tell you, she really believes this. Every conversation in her life is an opportunity to SCQA. Friends, loved ones, pets, conversations at the deli counter, everything." Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

> *"You see "Answer," and then the second row. Those might be why my answer is right, they might be "How" arguments to implement the answer. But they're bolstering the answer. I want to show you an example. Underneath each of those bolstering arguments is the evidence ."* Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

By engaging in trying to come up with a coherent communiation that honors SCqA, you set yourself to to make the communication respond to the audience's potential interest and in a way that you are required to achieve clarity. In other words, by acknowledging their duty, to respond to the audience's demand such as "why are we here?," we have to face our duty to use "logic in writing, thinking and problem solving" as the subtitle of Barbara's book indicates. 

#### How SCqA happens in the everyday situation 

<!--
@meta @section @outline 
* outline - introduction - scqa / K3.2.2 -      \____ How SCqA happens in the everyday situation 
--> 

What I really like from Barbara's Pyramid Principle is her attention to explain how SCqA happens in life. When I first heard about SCqA - after watching an online video - I had sensed its coherence: Well, yes, presenting a situation that is something that the audience knows to be true is a good baseline. Then, as something is needed of them, they shall indeed ask themselves questions like should I proceed? should I invest? how does that work? Those sort of questins. Which would, indeed, would show take them to a solution, an answer; but of course all that would only work if they had a good reason, if a see a complication, which can be solved by the answer that follows. But although that sounded coherent, still I wondered if the everyday communication had anything of that. For me it was enlightening to read a section from Barbara's book that had elaborated about variations to that standard order (2016, p.40). The following are examples I came up with to illustrate these variations: 

* Direct - ASC - The CEO comes into the building and tells her colleagues "Let us pivot. We should implement right now, feature ABC." She adds that "I heard from our customer, his loud and clear feedback, that what we are offering is not good." In addition, she added "If we don't do that feature, we won't be able to keep that customer." 

* Concerned - CSA - The CEO comes into into the building and tells the team: "Folks, we won't be able to keep that customer." She adds that "I heard from our customer, his loud and clear feedback, that what we are offering is not good." She concludes that "Let us pivot. We should implement right now, feature ABC."

* Aggressive - qSC - The CEO comes into into the building and tells the team: "What do we have to do keep that customer?" She adds that "I heard from our customer, his loud and clear feedback, that what we are offering is not good." She concludes that "If we don't do that feature, we won't be able to keep that customer."

Now, when I undertood these variations, I had recognized myself right away and how the form actually appears everywhere. . It also helped me to notice my use of arbitrary combinations, or even my ways to stress points with the intention of "adding value" such as qSCC, qCC, CCA, CAA, and more.

#### SCqA in formal communications

But that very same identification - that is in the everyday - and that the struggle can be observed, also gets in our way when we move into formal communications, which make us to come up with formal communications in quite arbitrary ways. And SCqA in this regard, goes well to solve our problems, especially to help us approach the design of our communication. 

#### The power of directeness 

<!--

* outline - introduction - scqa / K3.2.4 -      \____ The power of directeness

By now we have some idea that a structure exists that asks for an order for a communicative experience, and that the SCqA approach of Barbara gives access to this "minimum contract" that sustains an audience in front of the communicator, minimally to listen to the conversation, where it starts. With that, the audience being selected by afinitity with a subject, may be interested if they arrive at that Question, in the middle. If one is explaining how a machine operates, they might do doing so because the audience wants to know how it operates. If one listens to a roadmap for a trip, they do so because they are asking "how do I get there?" which goes along with complication that they might not know how to get there although they want. Likewise, by the nature of such structure, founders are asked to pitch investors which solid candidates to invest, that had prior experience investing in startups, or that do recognize the question "should I invest in this company?" 

With that, we should celebrate that our audiences respects, and gives more attention, when they see a logic for them - as they are in a better position to see what you have to offer, the Answer, given that they follow along with the Question which solves a Complication that they might have. In other words, as they sense a logic in the introduction, they feel that it is cheaper, in terms of cost of analysis, the understanding of what is going on. That is, in other words, quite persuasive. The good news, naturally, comes not only from the prize of better engagement with the audience but from the fact that the SCqA introduction is like the tip of the iceberg which is powerful as it helps to design the communicative experience; as it organizes the basics, it gives a direction. The bad news, and yet another area of concern, is that the gold has to be given too, beyond the introduction. 

Let us first consider the power of using the SCqA as a guide with an illustration of a real example where I had the opportunity to help a friend to get a job. A good friend, Roberto, had asked my help with a review to his résumé as he wanted to apply to a job, for a software engineering position. He knew he was good but was quite concerned that the job post listed one skill in particular as a requirement - a skill he didn't have. When he approached and asked for help, I was learning with The Pyramid Principle and already have had some interesting results, as in unintended benefits, of using SCqA in with communications in general, like with my family. I had already reported to Michael and Barbara that my life had changed. With that said, I wasn't sure that SCqA was going to help in that situation which would normally be about looking at his résumé trying to guess what to do, trying to be critical, perhaps offering feedback in some arbitrary directions, such as asking him to fix one or other part. Then, and quite sudden as I joined Roberto in our meeting, I caught myself explaining to him that his résumé had to start with something that the hiring manager would understand clearly, first. Right there, again, SCqA and Barbara and Michael seemed to be on my shoulders. So what happened which I am reconstructing now came as a sort of quick reaction. After the brief introduction to the basics of SCqA, we have then considered that the situation was that Roberto was to be the result, the answer, to that audience. The direction had also positioned ourselves to be concerned with the question - should I hire Roberto? And we also felt the necessity to deal with that area of concern - his apparent weakeness regarding that skill - as we realized that it was also a fact, they will know, no one would deny. Therefore, with situation came along too quick for us. First, truth, that Roberto had all the skills, in general. In addition, also a fact, that Roberto didn't have one skill. The complication that we came up, quite fast to be honest, had recognized the line of thinking where that missing skill should not be a real problem. Following along, and respecting the audience in mind, we realized that the audience would likely wonder - as a complication - if Roberto were able to work on that skill, if he really wanted to do that. It turned out that the missing skill was an area that Roberto had an interest, and was even engaged in a course what would cover that in the future. This setting gave us an opportunity to a good reading experience of his résumé, oriented to facts, that solved the possible complication, or objection. The point of complication were for us a bet, of course. This was one of many possibilities. Nevetheless, we felt appropriate to design a summary, in alighment with the idea of a cover letter, that acknowledged that the missing skill but guided the hiring manager to access the answer, the supporting points such as 1) Roberto is good. 2) Regarding that missing skill is already investing. And 3) other missing skills will appear in the future where his interest in learning is key. Now, at the end of our work, we also had the feeling that SCqA would be quite applicable in case he would come to be invited to an interview. If even joked that a busy human-resources professional would be happy to detec the logic in the communication and less judging the actual data given - by our perception that human resource folks are in a hurry and they would operate in a sort of quantitative, select-first-think-later mode. A few weeks later Roberto had reported he passed and that the work we did had helped a lot. Of course, I sort of sensed the fact that he was the actual value. Then, a few weeks later, I was invited to a party in his place before he had to move to another city, and while a bit drunk, he told his friends that the method also ahd helped him to give a good and clear answer in the interview. He gave me a bit of the credits but the real thanks goes to Barbara Minto. 

Now, to be fair, we had followed along the tip of the icerbeg, trying to set the bottom part of it so that it would stand. Maybe we were even quite arbitrary as we had assembled our Answer parts with three parts, recognizing Roberto's skills first, then Roberto's weaknesses and how he were addressing them, and the third part convering his interest in learning. I would say that we did it responsibly, in a way, but also that we didn't bother much to consider other scenarios. In other words, it is major that teams should work in the Answer part of the communicative experience as it is all connected. And this is yet another major reason for further investment in The Pyramid Principle. 

### Humanized prose

But all kinds of communicative experiences, eventually it boils down to the words being used - in the field - written, spoken, or told on the side of what is being presented. And because of that, eventually, all that were designed by the doers that deny coherence, or persuasion, are left with the consequences of such denial - the possibility that by overfocusing on data, such as generally the mechanics of what they want to say, will bring about their words and with that impact of what could be perceived as their style. It can come out in many ways, like the arbitrary ways, or can be pompous, or full of clichés, or even a brevity of style that is boring, or even what seems exciting but not in exciting way. But their audiences recognize even without being fully aware - like when they lose focus, can't follow anymore. 

To be more specific about the situation - this does not have to do with the intended willingness of the doer to communicate that way. Being that the origins of their communication had rise from the actual doing of things, or the mechanics of the communication, or the values and the data, it turns out that the data, and the mechanics, and the elements of value gets to be visible, gets to be exposed. Therefore, when the audience gets - if they happen to be that attentive - that they are using too many concept nouns, it is then less of an intended inclination, and reflection, that these concept nouns are elements that helps with the story; after all, they are the core elements. 

Therefore, it is complicated - especially for the serious doers - because the values, the elements of it, happen to be quite supporting to all that they want to say. In other words, it might even be unacceptable that these elements can't be visualized, that these can't get to be visible in the final presentation. Furthermore, they are pressured by their own supporting data, and that they see the connecting dots, and that they follow a vision. So they insist as they are involved with the mechanics of it from another level, like a more technical, or theoretical, and even a philosphical level in a way. For them, to cut these elements and favor coherence or persuasion, or some basic prose, might even look like evil, or lacking transparency, or failing to honor core values, or the actual work they did. Plus, or course, that would be perceived if they see coherence and persuation as tools that were designed for "marketing purposes" and not to be clear. 

Back in to "The Book of Marcio - Lost in Translation in Silicon Valley," I recall a passage of the very few passages where criticism about my communication went through and arrived on my plate. I was anxiously trying to help the team with some marketing-related effort, helping with the launch of a product. When sending some feedback to my direct manager, where she happened to be a marketing professional in a marketing position, I had written a few documents, most of them poorly written, or anxiously written, but my good intentions were there. And I happened to be quite interested in navigating aspects of the product, aspects of marketing, and had interests in life aspects too. And I had used quite extensively the word synergy, and synergies. And I had used that without really carring for any other usage - if any other usage existed. In other words, I don't even recalled having read anything, or watched anything, or even witnessed any communication using that word. But it was, in na way, like a vision, I was following a path and the words came through. But then, my manager and marketing professional had given her view, that I were writing words that seemed to look like a poor marketing language. She pointed to synergy and I recalled that I wanted to justify, to tell her why I used that word. In my defense, I wasn't using a common word, I wasn't using clichés words to convince or to improve my writing. That moment, which I recall as being a battle, kept open, like a field of a war where many died and where the terrain can only be visited for a reflection. A battle with no answers since I felt, inside of me, that it wasn't the bad case even if I had abused the usage of that word. And to defend her, now in retrospect, she likely caught those same words because they emerged - because those words were floating in the surface of my green colored lake, perhaps looked like plastic bottles on the surface. But she didn't point the lake, or the lack of clarity in the water. She pointe to synergy. And to go back to my own reasoning, the data that I was involved with had demanded me to use that word. I remember the intentions that emerged when I wanted to defend. I seemed to be screaming that we had to close a gap with certain things, to be more synergic perhaps. It took me decades to find the same word in a book when I happened to read Maslow on Management. But Maslow had used it in a way, around other clear words, if one happed to look at the surface. In the lake of Maslow, all seemed bright and alive and the synergies in the water just were in the right place, like the life elements that makes the to be seen as a beautiful ecosystem of life. 

William Zinsser, in On Writing Well, shows a situation of a school where he were asked to help with communications, where he had confirmed that he found a language that seemed so far to the actual parents of school kids. The example that follows is a letter written by the school principal: 

> *"Dear Parent, 
> We have established a special phone communication system to provide additional opportunities for parent input. During this year we will give added emphasis to the goal of communication and utilize a variety of means to accomplish this goal. Your inputs, from the unique position as a parent, will help us plan and implement an educational plan that meets the needs of your child. As open dialog, feedback and sharing of information between parents and teachers will enable us to work with your child in the most effective manner.
> Dr. George B. Jones
> Principal"*
> (1996, p.169) 

The section where this letter is shown is under "Business Writing." And by using that William alerts us - workers and communicators in the business world - how these kind of language shows and passes through. Willian's response, wearing the goggles of parents, or a human being, picks up the floating junk from the school's aquarium: 

> *"That's the kind of communication I don't want to receive, unique though my parent inputs might be. I want to be told that the school is going to make it easier for me to telephone the teachers and that they hope I'll call often to discuss how my children are getting along. Instead the parent gets junk: 'special phone communication system,' 'added emphasis to the goal of communication,' 'plan and implement an educational plan.' As for 'open dialogue, feedback and sharing of information,' they are three ways of saying the same thing. "* William Zinsser (1996, p.169)

By shaking the school's complex aquarium given the the school principal, William captures some of the "mechanical" elements that comes the way of parents, confusing them to see through, preventing them to get involved and to help. But he went on with another letter that helped me to visualize that the school weren't writing like that purely to create confusion, or to be pompous or to be too formal. He happened to find another letter where the school happened to write with two perspectives. In the first paragraph, the role of an educator, and in the second paragraph, a human: 

> *"Fundamentally, Foster is a good school. Pupils who require help in certain subjects or study skills areas are receivin special attention. In the scholl year ahead we seek to provide enhanced positive learning environments. Children, and staff, must work in an atmosphere that is conductive to learning. Wide varieties of instructional materials are needed. Careful attention to individual abilities and learning styles is required. Cooperation between school and home is extremmely important to the learning process. All of us should be aware of desired educational objectives for every child. 
>
> Keep informed about what is planned for our children this year and let us know about your own questions and about any special needs your child may have. I have met many of you in the first few weeks. Please continue to stop in to introduce yourself or to talk about Foster. I look forward to a very productive year for all of us. 
> Dr. Ray B Dawson
> Principal"* 
> (1996, p. 170)

The identification of this letter have helped me to see what had happed many times, and what still happens when I am giving out my written things, and when a technical language passes through, with concept nouns or abstrations that seem quite philosophical, or educational, or institutional, or too formal; and full of elaborations that shows some of the inner workings behind. Thus, to defend my inner amateur writer, these things escaping are quite honest things passing through. These things, the "synergic" plastic bottles foound in my lake letter, are likely some of the visible waste from a serious drinking. So they appear through concept nouns, abstract nouns, through jargon, through words of complex dictionary that happens to be my building blocks where one advances the craft. Sure, as we are involved with these building blocks, as we deal with these things all the time, iteratively and interactively. 

With that said, and to honor Willian's point, is not that we need to hit our faces in a wall and to thrown these complex things in the garbage. What William and Barbara ask us is to continue our writing further, to use it as the actual process of thinking, and to achieve the required clarity, the required structure, and the required prose that helps our audience to help ourselves. A point from Barbara's book called my attention right in the beginning to this idea - to the fact that most of my writings were valid writing because it were in the middle. And at the same time invalid as I didn't think of them as only part of the thinking process: 

> *""* Barbara Minto

They are asking us to think through, to start with the audience, with the subject, with that "contract" and within that view to honor why the audience should be there, why we want them, what is a reason for them. Does it being a complication, or an opportunity, and one that comes after some situation that they recognize and where can consider a potential solution or answer to be presented?. And, with that, and likewise, the prose follows, the prose conforms, the words that are plain, not with the keywords. Our job is, therefore, a translation job. More work is needed but the good news is that writing can be used as the process to get there. 

### Doing it responsibly

The celebration that writing is not manipulative does justice first to the team, their time, and invites us to the structured and logical work of Barbara which gives people an easier and structured way to deal with communication. It gives us management for communications. Her approach can be especially life-changing for entrepreneurs as they depend, interact, and need support from solutions-oriented audiences throughout the development phases of their startups.   

Now, this chapter exists not to convince you that your entrepreneurial journey will benefit from this thing called executive communications, like as if it is a tool for better communicative experiences. I rather think that the viewpoint of executive communication can be seen as the birthplace of communicative experiences. This brief moment is, therefore, a celebration, and an invitation, to a new paradigm, one that asks us to manage our communications. The movement towards executive communication is organized, it is self propelled by the very initial movement. With that, it provokes a communication that has value before it happens, as opposed to make arbitrary communciations and then using the value from it to reccount that it was what it was intended. It may help us to reset our point of view about communications, it may help entrepreneurs to change their operational model when communicating, it will not only support the entrepreneurial life of a startup, it will support your journey as a worker, as a citizen, and with your family and friends. What we did, beyond anything, a celebration to Barbara's work that "might change your life," as Michael would say.
