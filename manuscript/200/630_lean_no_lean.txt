# Lean deficit disorder 

<!-- ( ) leading paragraphs to be shorter --> 

O movimento *lean* permeou-se entre grandes empresas e no mundo dos empreendedores, pois reflete o mundo que ficou mais interativo, mais dinâmico, onde o produtor está mais próximo do consumidor. São inúmeras metodologias que promovem aprendizado que contribui com o processo de inovação para criação de produtos e serviços. Consideremos Lean Startup, que é uma metodologia onde o progresso depende do conceito de aprendizado validado [^footnote_leanstartup_validated_learning] que torna-se vital no ambiente de extrema incerteza. Segundo Steve Blank{id: author-steve-blank-200-600-a} [HBR 2013] a abordagem diminui os riscos porque favorece a experimentação em oposição ao pré-planejamento elaborado. 

<!-- situation of lean, highlights the complication that lean solves --> 

Vale lembrar que os movimentos lean mudam o padrão da fórmula tradicional que envolvia a escrita do plano de negócios, o *pitch* para os investidores, a montagem do time, lançamento do produto e finalmente vendas. Em outras palavras, os movimentos lean estão presentes na fase de design da startup ou da unidade de trabalho de empresas grandes que buscam inovar seus produtos ou serviços. Em outras palavras, a interação com o ambiente externo tem a intenção de reduzir riscos e permitir investimentos maiores, como por exemplo a justificação de um protótipo mais elaborado. Então, pode ser abstraído ser um processo que busca maior eficiência para o processo de inovação em contraste com o design e desenvolvimento de longo prazo, quando feito com dados estáticos, como hipóteses, premissas, pesquisa de mercado, etc, que pode acarretar em uma grande surpresa ao ser lançado para um público onde ninguém se interessa. Por essa e outras razões os movimentos lean remetem a ideia de menos trabalho, ou menos desperdício, com relação aos recursos já que a interação com o ambiente externo gera a oportunidade para o aprendizado validado que reduz incertezas que justificam maiores investimentos que são esperados também pela situação da startup que buscam o crescimento. Em outras palavras, as metodologias lean conferem grandes poderes uma vez que as dados obtidos por meio das interações justificam investimentos de recursos para novas etapas, mesmo sendo a etapa que pede para voltar o ciclo de novo. 

<!-- complication of lean, for us here --> 

<!-- some of these seem to be pre-complications? --> 

A razão para nosso momento desenvolve as grandes responsabilidades está na consequência natural dos processos poderosos porque está implícito na situação da startup - onde tudo começa pequeno, que parte de hipóteses, que os dados mesmo sendo fragmentados, ou insignificantes - que esses dados tornam-se intrínsicamente significativos no sentido que afeta as percepções do time, de forma geral. Em outras palavras, os dados tem muita presença, acabam que criticam ou aplaudem demais, dado que os experimentos são elaborados com base nas pressões de crescimento e buscam por valores representativos do mercado e significativos para mais investimento. 

Mas não deveriam os processos ágeis proporcionar mais aprendizado justamente porque estes estão mais próximos do ambiente externo? Sim, em teoria. Porém, na prática, empreendedores executam as atividades do mundo ágil como uma forma de auto-validação e de auto-crítica para que possam avançar na execução da empresa. Assim eles que bram um contrato fundamental da proposta do movimento ágil e dizem que fazem *lean*, mas na realidade não fazem. Talvez essa questão possa ser vista como uma síndrome que decorre de baixa autoestima, tornam-se “perfeccionistas” quando querem somar pontos de sucesso e não se sentem à vontade em avançar com maior reconhecimento sobre seus problemas dando chance para algo que alinha melhor com objetivos, valores que envolve aceitar as falhas e críticas no caminho e encontrar oportunidaes para continuar aprendendo.  

Decorre ainda deste ambiente, possíveis questões que vem da pressão do crescimento como por quê será que empreendedores não investem tempo fazendo pesquisas com o objetivo em provar que suas ideias podem falhar? Ou de forma mais geral, estariam os empreendedores sujeitos a perder o compromisso com o potencial do negócio como valores e o significado? Ou ainda, estariam empreendedores comprometidos em validar a natureza do processo, as dificuldades, e por exemplo como a influência dos seus experimentos, como a modelagem, escolha dos experimentos, dados coletados, em cima do processo como elementos que podem alterar os caminhos? 

<!-- answer key line? --> 


<!-- elaboration of key lines ahead? --> 

Esse olhar pede por uma leitura consciente sobre a utilização de processos lean. Nossa primeira reflexão surge a partir da execução dos processos lean, que mesmo quando executados de forma elegante, criam condições onde times, de baixo de pressão, perdem a visão holística que é a visão de propósito. Em outras palavras é possível tirar “nota 10” em um determinada tarefa e falham na tarefa final, como o compromisso com uma visão que vai de encontro com oferecer valor para um mercado de tal forma a operar de forma lucrativa e sustentável e duradoura. 

Nossa segunda reflexão, é centrada no time de uma startup em estágio inicial, ou até um empreendedor, que tem sua atenção desviada e perde a conexão com um propósito maior. Em outras palavras, não é que o time se vê em um objetivo de defender um sucesso como quem está conscientemente forçando, mas acaba por defender um caminho pelo sucesso ao trazer o olhar crítico, como um juíz, que diante dos dados do ambiente externo, defende como quem critíca demais  aos moldes quantitativos ou processos de seleção levando a decisões com sinais fracos mas fortes para decisões que de qualquer forma afetam a visão de propósito. 

Finalmente, concluimos com algumas das ideias de pensadores dos movimentos lean e outros que estão compromissados com o entendimento sobre as dificuldades de navegar com interações com o mundo externo e ao mesmo tempo estarem dentro e fora dos dados com o objetivo de criarem mais condições para inovação no mercado. 

## Experienging the holistic view under pressure 

Mas *Lean Startup* é somente uma dessas metodologias. Em 2014, o Google promoveu um debate entre os criadores do *Lean Startup* e do *Design Thinking* intitulada *Lean Startup Meets Design Thinking*. Nesse debate, o autor Eric Ries{id: author-eric-ries-200-600-b} falou sobre a abrangência desses processos:

> Grab the Design silo  —and they have read Tim’s book, and if they understand what a modern approach design looks like, you will see kind of design thinking that he mentioned. Grab Marketing, you will see customer development. If you grab Operations, you will see some Dev Ops.. — Eric Ries{id: author-eric-ries-200-600-d} (Google for Startups, 2017, [XX:YY](https://medium.com/@taboca/disconnection-from-the-everyday-works-purpose-7c4b29d861d9))

[^designthinking]: *Design Thinking* é um processo na mesma linha de outros “leves” ou “ágeis” mas originado do mundo do design e aplicável em um contexto mais amplo nas empresas. https://hbr.org/2008/06/design-thinking

Eric passa a ideia da abrangência das metodologias ágeis, todas bem intencionadas para elevar diferentes departamentos na linha do movimento ágil. Porém, tal abrangência ou abundância, não necessariamente resolve a questão maior da coerência entre departamentos:

> *“You might find an organization where at every silo, things are very iterative, customer centric, and where people are really focused on learning. But then, zoom out and you will say “wow, this must be a really adaptable, learning oriented company, this is fantastic.” But actually, what you will see in a lot of companies, is, although there all this iteration learning happening at each individual silo, the actual work product that company produces, is passed binder to binder from each silo to the next, in a totally linear and old school waterfall style approach. “* — Eric Ries{id: author-eric-ries-200-600-e2} (Google for Startups, 2017, [XX:YY](https://medium.com/@taboca/disconnection-from-the-everyday-works-purpose-7c4b29d861d9))

Segundo Eric, os líderes desses departamentos acreditam que se pudessem controlar os outros departamentos as coisas seriam bem mais fáceis. Ou seja, o olhar de dentro do silo lhes dá esperança que suas metodologias ágeis são suficientes para resolver o sucesso do todo. Mas ainda assim, o desafio dos CEOs está na harmonia entre os silos — eles sofrem na arte da coreografia, que atua entre o produto do trabalho dos silos:

> *"Of course, everybody in all the silos are saying that, and, for modern managers that can be really challenging. So, for me, my aspiration for Lean Startup is not to have people adopt it as yet another silo approach, but rather to take these common elements, that are common to design thinking, and to agile, and to lean, and certain apply them at a system-wide, at the company level, so that we have a common framework for understanding what are the problems, a common approach for the process that we are going to use to solve those problems, and most importantly, we can speak the language of business to say “he are the concrete financial and business outcomes that we can achieve if we work in this way”"*. — Eric Ries{id: author-eric-ries-200-600-f2} (Google for Startups, 2017, [XX:YY](https://medium.com/@taboca/disconnection-from-the-everyday-works-purpose-7c4b29d861d9))

Essa preocupação com a união, ou falta de, entre os departamentos das empresas, pode servir de base para a exploração do problema que empreendedores também enfrentam quando lidam com os processos ágeis no estágio inicial das suas startups. Nesse contexto, obviamente não existem silos, os vários departamentos. No início, não existe produto nem clientes. A única coisa que empreendedores têm são as hipóteses iniciais. Segundo Steve Blank{id: author-steve-blank-200-600-b}, uma *startup* é uma instituição em fase de descoberta. [^author-steveblankstartup].

### The breakdown of the holistic view 

Imagine a professional that was allowed to make interviews and to bring data, thus was kept safe in a sylo. But the professional did her best, brought data and a conclusion that would provoke the higher-order system. This professional, when it completes, submits her work to the higher-order judges that happen to find other conflicting values in accepting the experiment as done. This situation brought up a tension as the assumption of the higher-order was that the new data would provoke the whole system in course. Would then the employee be rewarded how in this case? This brings about the complications that people are engaged in being someone and that being someone is configured with settings where they are biased to please. 

In another startup setting, a chief designer recruited two UX experience designers to conduct usability tests. However, when the results were presented, the chief designer felt offended and took the feedback as criticism to her own work. This situation raises a concern: should a designer avoid conducting usability tests to prevent defensive reactions? The case illustrates the potential for conflict and in this story the subordinate designer felt frustrated as her work would not be welcomed although she even invested more than usual to do a good job. This would be a situation of a job position that would be jeopardized by the unconverings of a subordinate's well done work because of lack of transparency about potential outcomes and general commitment with purpose from all parts. 

These are situations of a complex work setting with multiple people and where it is important to map the values that are influencing everyone's work. 

The finding of learning experiments are valid but a lack of purpose happens as the team in the sylo is not exposed to higher purposes and values affecting which makes the experiment grain concreteness for its own survival, as a reaction. In other words, if under a lack of general purpose, which would create the basis of wiser and wider view, the experiment and its validated learnings gain too much value, in comparison. 

> *“It’s easy for us, to kind of get lost and forget what the purpose of our work everyday is. I think a lot of the waste in the modern work environment has to do with people that become disconnected from what is that purpose, what is the greater meaning of the work that we do.”* [Eric Ries @ 10m35s](https://youtu.be/bvFnHzU4_W8?t=10m35s) Lean Startup Meets Design Thinking






* Uma hipótese é que ele estava com medo, por exemplo diante do que ele achou que era esperado da sua posição — por exemplo medo do seu trabalho ser julgado e sua posição ser colocada em risco. Esta situação, caso fosse uma realidade, relaciona-se com cultura da empresa e também com a comunicação das iniciativas já que o designer-chefe poderia ter trabalhado com seus superiores para que estivesse tudo bem em encontrar erros.

* A ideia do processo todo é de encontrar aprendizado.

* Uma questão colocada, neste sentido, foi a questão do tempo e pressão. Ou seja, existem condições onde os especialistas estão com uma agenda fazendo pressão. E nesta situação, comentamos que é sempre o melhor que existam dois eixos. Um eixo de aprendizado e um eixo de execução. E faz parte do desenvolvimento lean, orientado ao aprendizado, a situação de aprender, anotar, crescer; e as vezes entregar outra coisa mas sem esconder o aprendizado, ou seja, permitindo uma opção para versões futuras e mantendo o investimento do aprendizado como pauta viva.

## Entrepreneurial attention deficit 

<!-- Steve's additional research 

* https://steveblank.com/2011/08/15/theres-always-a-plan-b/
* 

MAP14 public forum, 2014, Australia – Rohan Workman interviewed Steve Blank and asked about challenge of doing lean versus talking about lean. 

Steve Blank acknowledges the problem as a of disorder that affects founders, and the reality is that “one data point is not enough” says Steve.  

Rohan Workman highlighted this issue well when he interviewed Steve Blank and asked whether the popularization of lean movements reveals entrepreneurs who claim to do lean but actually don't. Steve not only agreed but also revealed extreme cases of the situation. One of them is the extremely funny one.

> *"A founder goes out of the building, hears something from a customer. Comes back to his poor company and announces — we need to pivot! we need to pivot! and we need to pivot again!"* (Steve Blank, MAP14, 2014, 24m10s)

For Steve, the idea of "pivoting" is used by founders as an excuse for an attention deficit that affects founders. From this observation, he created the Rule of 72 Hours to help entrepreneurs reflect on the situation:

> “Keeping your mouth shut, from when you think you got an insight to when you are allowed to announce the word pivot, inside your company.” (Steve Blank{id: author-steve-blank-200-600-g2} @ MAP14, 2014, 24m34s)

The Rule of 72 Hours is a joke-reminder. It assists entrepreneurs in remembering that they are subject to this attention deficit which diverts them from their major goal. They might become enchanted with one or another activity in the agile process and lose focus on the broader objective. When they do so, their experiments cease to be scientific, no longer remaining detached in their critique. If they were more dispassionate about the criticism, the experiment and validation, they would indeed be leveraging the outcomes of the activities, regardless of positive or negative results, which would be a step towards the innovative future in the idea and mechanism of the startup.

The situation following shows that an agenda, or the need to succeed, gets in the way of the founder and the team. For some entrepreneurs, that never left the room, perhaps going out can be fascinating and too nice, or romantic. That maybe is simply the truth of the situation: Talking with someone can seem not only fascinating but much better, such as in contrast with idealizing things.  

Thus, tests are conducted with a critical tone that selects or validates, pressured by a connection with numbers or projections of a final product. In this process, teams might lose the connection with the greater purpose that brought them together in the first place. Or they may respond to the numbers and stumble upon product variations, or pivot to other directions almost arbitrarily, or become demotivated by the data from their experiments, which were very significant in terms of numbers, among other situations.

### The fusion with the critic  

In the corporate situation, we note that people or groups present their preferences, which impact project desicions as biases affecting the interpretations after lean project execution and learnings. For example, teams need to achieve their goals, whether individual or group, so they need to perform their work in light of expected objectives. And this can be a conflict with the situation of learning the lean processes.

Confrontation with the strenght of data which is now incoming and result of the design of experiments. And the very conflict between "they just don't get it" and "they might be right" as it is noticeable that the problem is not clear, the audience might not be clear, in front of a perception of clear vision. The reality is that “one data point is not enough” as indicated by Steve, is strong enough to cause change of path in the development. As an illustration, entrepreneurial team A might give up vision A as data traction B while team B gave up vision B and found data traction A. Now these teams are executing towards growth in spaces they didn't enjoy initially. Eventually if the two companies grow, then could move to the other companies? Unlikely that a swift move happens.  

### Courage to break the critic - containement 

In this section, we may consider the tame the critic, therefore to allow room for external interactions where data chimes in, and where the critical analysis is deferred to later, with a more conscious and friendly secondary phase, such as of what a conscious board would do. 

As indicated by Steve Blank, the other extremme is a reaction of a great founder that after looking at the data come to the realization that "they just don't get the idea". But down the line, he adds, the founder thinks, "ah, maybe they're trying to tell me something". (Steve Blank, 2014, MAP Unimelb 26m49s)

The inspiration to this model is taken from the situation of a writer that may attempt to get feedback but as she does, runs the risk of listening too much to the market and become either blocked or too tied to the market data, in the case of the writer the arbitrary critic that was invited. This complexity requires, as recommended by Julia Cameron, that a writer is nurturing readers, thus to be free from the critic that is unconscious, not free of any critic, the friendly critic in the model of Julia Cameron allows for the text to improve towards it's vision with compassion and support: 

> *"It is very important that we keep a few nurturing readers as friends to our work quite apart from whatever is going on in our publishing life. We need people who are happy to hear a poem or an essay for its own sake and not as career maneuaveurs. The part of us that writes must be allowed to write freely and not always with an eye to the market. An eye to the market is part of the writing life, but if it is too large a part, it shuts down invention and leads to the blockage of many valuable avenues of exploration which are not - at first blush - commercial." (Julia Cameron, 1998, p.181)

The startup version of that support can be created and a conscious point of view for the analysis of lean data may be proposed as: Data that is taken is taken but it does not mean that actions are immediately taken. The analysis of what to do needs a point of view of support which takes in consideration the values, the vision, a wider view. Exactly because one data point is not enough, one data point can't either be too strong to impact positively or negatively. Being one or a lot of data points, a supporting role must exist which is never unaware of the team values, team vision, team beliefs. 

### Considerations about anchoring vs. learning  

Let's start by talking about the Business Model Canvas, the Lean tool developed by Alexander Osterwalder that was designed for learning, but entrepreneurs use it as a means to seek status.

I ended up writing "never send a canvas to your investor" while driving my car one day, with my girlfriend beside me. She commented that a colleague, who was trying to present an idea and was going to present in the future, had sent an image of a Canvas via WhatsApp. At that moment, a wave of adrenaline surged through my body, the strong insight that gave the title to the article, which is indeed a very simple idea but highlights a phenomenon. Entrepreneurs are not using the Canvas to its constructive potential and often simply fall victim to its destructive potential, the misuse governed by a poor focus, perhaps the need to advance towards success and not use the Canvas as a tool for interaction.

{ Because the implied idea of validated learning, a premisse, would it be the case that teams might anchor themselves? }

The Canvas process makes it clear that "xxx" and one more thing, it guarantees nothing. It has no date, no promise. Like any lean process, the central idea is learning, not validation. Steve Blank, in Customer Development (Four Steps to the Epiphany), emphasizes the search part of the process as one that returns to the beginning, designed to go backward, like many other Lean processes. But, again and again, entrepreneurs want to move forward. The positive sense of urgency that becomes a villain. And in this sense, a fundamental point of the whole story is worth mentioning - that the act of entrepreneurship is both science and art that must be led by those who are willing, prepared, and have a strong connection with the idea, with the merit.

#### Case of founder's denial to try a different canvas 




#### Considerations of selective pressure 

Perhaps entrepreneurs are applying all the processes, one on top of the other, in a generalized and poorly organized manner.

What's the problem? They learn the basics of customer development, of Canvas, and then embark on the mission. And therein lies a wrong premise, the mission. {confusion of the mission with the point of the exercise which may actually signal that a given bad direction needs to be avoided - acceptable losses} It's as if they create a pipeline with a set date for a choice to be made. On that date, they will simply move forward with what they have. The mix of processes creates a negative artificiality to the potential emergence of innovation.

While, on one hand, Canvas and other Lean processes indicate the cycle that should be repeated, on the other hand, the entrepreneur, or teams responsible for the discovery process, are setting dates and creating criteria with a clear objective: to move forward. As if the generalization like "execution is everything" takes a bias, advance with the best of what you do in the time you have. Moreover, there is something very interesting in the law of xxxxxxx (check this) that says if you have time x, you will be able to do it in x - indeed, the world has learned to operate under windows of processing, windows of opportunity, this is part of the Lean execution process, of agile approaches. The wrong lesson, on the other hand, is when entrepreneurs believe that the result of the work window is necessarily information that validates the next stage in light of the pre-planned plan.

<!-- Following 5 stars --> 

Important - that the scenario of perfection is never real, thus the assumption of perfection is represents the risk. The ability to see the outcome of a learning cycle as subjective is a must. 

<!-- Following 5 stars --> 

See, the idea of agile processes is precisely to allow new discoveries, including those that lead teams to consider critical actions like returning to the initial step, pivoting (basically giving up and restarting another idea when you still have money or resources). So why do entrepreneurs consistently increment their projects with the Lean process?

But they don't do it this way - they use the Lean processes to evolve the same idea, as if at any cost, eventually accepting changes in the face of strong impact waves, such as when money and resources run out, co-founders disagree, the next round of investment never happens, or simply "the product doesn't sell" while the machine is bleeding out.

<!-- Following 5 starts - interrupted by major value --> 

In addition to the above effects, another very accepted approach for entrepreneurs is the strong signal of supposed validation by third-party systems - not passing a competition, not being among the finalists in the accelerator's evaluation process. As if the Lean window ceases to be Lean and becomes a shot of execution because there is a pipeline ahead that can affirm. If it works, move forward; if it fails, give up. There's no time to do Lean as it should be done.

<!-- can the following be trasnformed in a consideration about purpose? --> 

In "Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital" (Stanford, 2013), the given perspective may appear for some that sucessful startups didn't use lean principles - as it indeed focuses in principles towards thesis, or vision, or what was referred as "precedents driven". Therefore, it should be acknowledged that VCs, such as top-tier VCs, are doing their research and working in analysis of what is happening to the world. This can be also confirmed by the situation - as detailed in Brad Stone's 2017 book The Upstarts: How Uber, Airbnb, and the Killer Companies of the New Silicon Valley Are Changing the World - of Sequoia when they wanted to invest in the business of ride sharing which took them to try to invest in a company in the east of United States which didn't work because the CEO had refused to stay away from yellow cabs which was a concern at the time which Sequoia had; while the investiment with Uber had worked as Uber was focusing in black cars, like limo service. Of course, Sequoia was also interested in eventually scaling towards yellow cabs, which is what Uber did.

But it should be noted that yet values in the lean processes are deeply interconnected, such as if we consider that startups that didn't explicitly claim to use formal lean processes doesn't imply in having not moved with experimentation and data validation and interactions with the external environment. Consider, for example, the case of the successful situation of Facebook, as highlighted in the lecture (Stanford, 2013), where there is a perceived expertise of Facebook's founding team, including Mark Zuckerberg, and the situation where the innovation didn't follow any lean practices - needless to indicate that lean movements wheren't there - but nevertheless that are so many aspects recognized by investors that have reflected in examples like this such as the interactions with a niche market of college students.

## Expanding the horizon 


<!-- check sb suggestion board case, reflect on that --> 


Since awareness is key to any process, and founders generally suffer from being enamored with the process, it becomes the founder’s responsibility first to recognize such syndrome; then second, to find for ways to ensure the process is running with quality.

But the problem with quality is always in knowing which criteria to use for these situations that can be really adverse. In Steve Blank’s suggestion, founders should find a board of directors or an advisory board: The body responsible for from an outside perspective therefore supporting the founder to get out from instant pressures, and compromising decisions.




The key to executing the process is to do it first without holding the agenda for the success (for the business or the idea.) Success, for the process, is most likely the case of learning new information (good or bad.) When going out, or trying to be systematic about the data you get, you need to be genuine to the cause (the bold vision) but at the same time recognize uncertainty and that learning will help you out in the long run.

And the same may also apply to what the founder would get as failure. In Scott Belsky’s Making Ideas Happen, a reading about failure does not have to be a dead end:

> “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity. Stay strong and stay calm as a situation settles itself over time and the clouds around any period of change start to dissipate. “ (Scott Belsky, 2010, Making Ideas Happen)


* Scott Belsky em Making Idea Happen deixa a dica sobre a prática da tolerância que permite injustiças temporárias. “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity.

### Release of control and access to move on 

No mundo onde vários colaboradores estão executando suas ações debaixo de grande pressão (por exemplo resultante de indicadores chave, agenda, metas e ainda levando em consideração as agendas e tendências específicas das especialidades dos colaboradores) acontece que as vezes grupos se encontram diante de opções divergentes.

* Marcio colocou a história que ele viveu quando fez um contrato para o projeto SongBird, da Califórnia. O pessoal do Songbird contratou ele para fazer um tema de design para o aplicativo de música. O Marcio tentou seguir algumas especificações mas no final do dia acabou fazendo um sistema para criar vários temas coloridos. No final do mês o SongBirg novo foi lançado com um outro tema, não o do Márcio; foi quando o Márcio descobriu que haviam dois contratos sendo executados em paralelo.

* Fabrício indicou sobre a situação onde pode-se optar por caminhos A ou B, mas ao mesmo tempo existe o problema da falta de tempo ou de recursos limitados.

* Marcio apontou o caso do Andy Groove em High Output Management, que aponta que reuniões devem procurar permitir que as melhores ideias possam surgir, ou seja, não é importante que exista um consenso na questão das ideias, mas sim na parte da decisão para execução. Um time deve procurar melhores ideias, e mesmo que uma pessoa seja favorecida, o outro (ideia oposta) deve estar colaborando depois da decisão do todo. Essa ideia em geral deve ser algo comprado (buy-in) pelos colaboradores antes dos processos criativos, ou seja, preparando eles para a situação de aprendizado e para a posterior execução.






* Put MD case of Disney 

Em geral, poucos empreendedores têm coragem para investir o tempo nesse tipo de esforço. Outros fazem pior ao se convencerem que a execução das atividades  ágeis por si só significa sucesso. E assim eles dizem “Ah, eu fiz o processo do *canvas*” ou “Estou fazendo o processo correto das entrevistas qualitativas” e passam a avançar em um modo acelerado que os cega de reconhecer que deveriam aprender e retroceder. Executar as metodologias ágeis é bom, mas não vale nada quando questões fundamentais não são respeitadas. Pior ainda: é quando o processo é usado errado de forma consciente e deliberada para criar uma falsa ideia, como quem usa os dados em uma apresentação para provar um ponto, mas sabe que é falso. Nessa linha, existem empreendedores de vários tipos: inocentes, encantados, e os que se enganam. Mas independente do perfil, uma coisa é certa — o negócio não sobrevive pois no final é o negócio que dita como serão as coisas.

Tirar “nota 10” em uma ou outra tarefa não implica que o empreendimento irá ganhar o jogo na partida final. Muitas vezes, lá na frente, quando chegam as grandes crises, empreendedores percebem que estavam ignorando os sinais — que os sinais estavam por toda parte mas eles não queriam enxergar. Então, o problema é similar, tanto para empreendedores como para empresas — líderes se perdem na coreografia dos processos. Nas empresas, como sugerido por Eric Ries{id: author-eric-ries-200-600-h}, a dificuldade está em harmonizar o resultado dos trabalhos dos silos funcionais ágeis. No contexto dos empreendedores, a dificuldade está em olhar por fora os “silos” da execução de atividades ágeis. ! Na fase de descoberta da startup, eles precisam ser tornar melhores generalistas; devem sobrevoar acima das suas ideias, das suas próprias paixões, dos seus produtos e até acima do mercado. Nesse sentido, devem se tornar advogados múltiplos, que defendem suas ideias mas igualmente defendem o ambiente externo que pode estar contra as suas ideias. Esse ponto de vista só tem uma intenção — mais chances para o negócio.






### Possibilities 



#### Considerations of endless cycles 

One case in situation are a scenario of possibility of the lean processes is that the team enters in a sort of endless cycles - even so temporarily - which where they might deal with doing again better, trying to be more professional about the construction of the hypothesis, and the means of tests, and they might explore specific value propositions, or their attempt to understand customers, and they might be very influenced by the very network that they are interacting with, so in a way they this is a very part of lean but it might start to bother the team that something is wrong.

#### Traces of disconnection with purpose such as mission 

The other case situation is when the team feels a disconnection with a purpose, or vision or mission - to note that in the early stages these things are not clearly distinct but nevertheless the reason that they work might connect with - and they are not comfortable anymore because the very interactions of lean takes them in a sort of new direction and it might be difficult for them to change their primary premises, or established anchors with these values, that would otherwise set them back in a promising direction which they feel connected. 

The other case is when the team may find traction that takes them in the direction or they might pivote into a promising direction where there's traction but there's certainly a disconnect with a vision and values of the founders and then they have the dilemma which is to jump out of the boat or to actually continue to run which is certainly maybe the case where they are under pressure but nevertheless they don't know if they continue to run they could actually end up in a situation of frustrations or other value-based or mission or vision based dissonance; and therefore by this interaction they may end up being less feeling in love and by that running into the possibility of being executors of a cause for money and the dissonance or the comparison with the other opportunity for them would put them in a place to not be proud of execution and not feeling as somebody in that line that demands evolving and leadership.

#### Traction in alignment with purpose 

And there's certainly the case where the interactions and the effort that the team has put in place brought data that is relevant or it means traction in the very direction in alignment with the vision they have and that at least gives them the opportunity to move on at least to another more complex configuration, towards growth, which naturally will bring ahead potential challenges related to the complexitity of the need to grow in a bigger market which they could be not a initially aware, or natural demands growth in other directions by the growth needs either driven by company values, or growth pressures driven by investors, or even the natural demands of the consumers which more and more participates, and continue to engage with evolving needs. 


## Conclusion

In terms of conclusion with these cases all of this creates the basis for a situation latent in terms of situation for latent innovation. Because it is certain that in all areas in terms of users using things for their needs, there are common needs and opportunities to organize interactions; in other words, there are things that can be improved in certainly innovation that can be applied therefore one possible conclusion is that the lean processes and certain direction of the experiments might actually suggest that lean takes care of itself while the team will have to decide if they like it or not to be in the boat or not; which connects with the points about purpose and indicated by authors such Eric Ries, and Steve blank's points about love.

The other side of interpretation has to do with the that from the general usage of lean, it might be considered that it adds the critical eye, the eye of the critic, and establishes by doing so a sort of judgment exactly by its idea of validated learning which is tied with the needs for data to advance towards growth. Bring about the theme of lean and the challenges of putting in practice when executing a startup may give us a window of opportunity to reflect about value and risks of interacting with external environment, the environment that brings the very customers and on the side participants that supports growth, which see themselves as on the side of who offers. In other words, augumentation to voices. 

And the needed viewpoint that these subjects are now relevant to the theme of lean. In other words there's so many articles and materials and consultants and coaches supporting lean executors and as this practitioners are involved in the very expertise of doing lean as in doing lean consciously, it becomes evident that the subject of controlling or being controlled by the external interactions or the when to release by the perceptions of limited external interactions, or the needs to establish a perspective on top of any interactions are part of the very subject of lean and therefore it makes lean valid because the other option would be to not care at all and continue to do so without a window of opportunity for a reflection. Needeless to say that practitioners and authors of resources related to the lean movement, such as Eric Ries and Steve Blank among otghers, are not careless and have kept in the loop of lean, not as watchers but carefully using the feedback that they get throughout time to add new perspectives, needless to say of a world in movement. The very book of Eric Ries points presents a point of view that indicates the the need from a degree of view from above where the purpose is to bring back the values - as he wrote "purpose"  of the team members which may bring about values and the vision of the business and the consciousness about the ability to judge as in judgment from outside as in alignment with purpose which is very useful in the front of the potential critic that of course chimes in. And, needless to say, that any viewpoint that comes above everything is a very possibility of influencing everything.

Entrepreneurship, as discussed by Steve Blank and highlighted in the article "Who is an Entrepreneur," is less about inborn talent and more about a deep-seated willingness to learn and engage. Blank's comparison to Renaissance artists, who needed both passion and hands-on practice, underscores this idea. Whether one starts as a wantrepreneur or an entrepreneur, the key differentiator is the internal drive to embark on this challenging and unpredictable journey. This concept suggests that entrepreneurship is not just taught, but also chosen, with success stemming from a blend of desire, dedication, and hands-on experience.
