# Lean deficit disorder 

The lean movement has permeated among large companies and the entrepreneurial world, as it reflects the need for more agility and efficiency in a world that has become faster, more interactive, more dynamic, a world where the consumer is more involved in the innovation process; in other words, closer to the process of creation of products and services [^footnote_ericvonhippel_democratizing_innovation]. A decade ago, Harvard Business Review and Steve Blank recognized that, although young, the movement titled "the lean start-up" would be on par with various other trends like the need for closer customer relationships, openness to failure, willingness to change course, and more transparent accounting of the innovation process - all this to improve the old processes where elaborate pre-planning prevailed. Over time, in the last decade, the lean movement has garnered much more attention and contributed to greater efficiency in the process of innovation for the creation of products and services.

[^footnote_ericvonhippel_democratizing_innovation]: In *Democratizing Innovation,* MIT professor and author, Eric von Hippel, explores the phenomenon of User Innovation, a concept where users of products and services play an active role in the innovation process. Von Hippel argues that users, being close to their own needs and experiences, often innovate by modifying and improving products. This user-driven innovation blurs the traditional boundaries between consumer and producer, fostering a collaborative environment where users not only consume but also contribute to the development and improvement of products and services

<!-- situation of lean, highlights the complication that lean solves --> 

Let's consider Lean Startup, which is a methodology where progress depends on the concept of validated learning [^footnote_leanstartup_validated_learning], becoming vital in an environment of extreme uncertainty. Lean movements have changed the standard of the traditional formula that involved writing a business plan [^footnote_steveblank_oldapproach], pitching to investors, assembling the team, launching the product, and finally sales. In other words, lean movements are present in the design phase of a startup or the work unit of large companies seeking to innovate their products or services. In other words, interaction with the external environment is intended to reduce risks and allow for larger investments, such as the justification of a more elaborate prototype. Therefore, it can be abstracted to be a process that seeks greater efficiency for the innovation process in contrast with long-term design and development, when done with static data such as hypotheses, assumptions, market research, etc., which can lead to a big surprise when launched to an audience where no one is interested. For this and other reasons, lean movements refer to the idea of less work, or less waste, with respect to resources since interaction with the external environment creates the opportunity for validated learning that reduces uncertainties that justify larger investments that are also expected by the situation of startups seeking growth. In other words, lean methodologies confer great powers since the data obtained through interactions justify investments of resources for new stages, even if the stage asks to return to the cycle again.

[^footnote_leanstartup_validated_learning]: Validated Learning is a core concept in Eric Ries's book *The Lean Startup* (Ries, 2011). It refers to a process where startups use empirical data gathered from real customers to validate their hypotheses about both the business and product. This approach emphasizes learning over mere intuition and guides startups in making decisions based on what customers actually want, thereby reducing market risks and avoiding the building of products that customers do not need

[^footnote_steveblank_oldapproach]: In the article's, *Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything,* Steve Blank (2013) contrasts the decades-old formula, where innovators - small or large - would start by focusing on the development of the business plan followed by investment to producize and sell; with the at the time modern methodology named "lean startup" that enabled teams to search for business models using iterations with the external environment, therefore reducing risks of higher bets, not to mention the alignment with that other innovation processes, such as open source and democratization of venture financing, which reveals the presence of users in the innovation processes.

<!-- complication of lean, for us here --> 

<!-- some of these seem to be pre-complications? --> 

The reason for our moment developing great responsibilities lies in the natural consequence of powerful processes because it is implicit in the startup situation - where everything starts small, based on hypotheses, even if the data is fragmented or insignificant - that these data become intrinsically significant in the sense that it affects the team's perceptions, in general. In other words, the data have a strong presence, often either criticizing or applauding excessively, given that experiments are elaborated based on growth pressures and the need for searching values, or validation, or the voice of the market, which are significant elements for more investment. Additionally, it is important to contextualize that precisely because there is no market dependence, like serving conquered customers, and the team being small, agility is observable in that startups can rapidly change direction and allows for more failures to occur in the search for correct approaches, and even a high tolerance for errors to the point of becoming a value, or almost a pride for founders [^footnote_samaltman_blitzscaling_pivot_generation].

[^footnote_samaltman_blitzscaling_pivot_generation]: There are many obvious reasons to consolidate the general idea that startups are in a good position to move faster, in the sense of changing directions, as of course the initial situation starts with no market dependencies and the small team, the intentions to execute cheaper experiments, and the like. But the general idea of pivoting went further from the notion that entrepreneurs should embrace the possibility, towards a point that pivoting is promoted, as illustrated by Sam Altman's interview (Altman, 2015) which recognized that "Silicon Valley really gets the pivot thing wrong," to the point that teams brag about pivoting, which for him means bragging about failing which is different from the needed aspect of tolerance for failure.

But shouldn't agile processes provide more learning precisely because they are closer to the external environment? Yes, in theory. However, in practice, entrepreneurs execute activities in the agile world as a form of self-validation and self-criticism so they can advance in the execution of the company. Thus, they breach a fundamental contract of the agile movement's proposal and claim they are doing lean, but in reality, they are not. Perhaps this issue can be seen as a syndrome stemming from low self-esteem; they become “perfectionists” when they want to accumulate success points and do not feel comfortable advancing with greater recognition of their problems, giving a chance to something that aligns better with objectives, values that involve accepting failures and criticisms along the way, and finding opportunities to continue learning.

This environment also raises possible questions stemming from the pressure of growth, such as why entrepreneurs do not invest time in research aimed at proving that their ideas can fail? Or, more broadly, might entrepreneurs be at risk of losing commitment to the potential of the business in terms of values and meaning? Or, are entrepreneurs committed to validating the nature of the process, the difficulties, and, for example, how the influence of their experiments, such as modeling, choice of experiments, and collected data, can alter the course of the process?

<!-- elaboration of key lines ahead? --> 

In the pursuit of a conscious understanding and interpretation of the use of lean processes, our first reflection focuses in the conditions where teams, under pressure, lose the holistic vision which is the vision of purpose, ending up diminishing the potential of the process as they might, to name an extremme case, over focus in the process or the data.

Our second reflection focuses on the team of an early-stage startup, or even a solo entrepreneur, and explores how a diverted attention is experienced when doing lean - which can lead to a loss of connection with that needed greater purpose. In other words, we will examine the tendency to become overly centered on the lean process, especially when it presents an opportunity to disregard subjective data that might not seem appropriate. This can lead to a kind of fusion where the criticized becomes the critic, where the process ends up over-criticizing, adhering to quantitative molds or selection processes, leading to strong decisions based on weak signals, which in turn impact the vision of purpose.

Finally, we conclude with some thoughts from thinkers of the lean movement and others who are committed to understanding the challenges of navigating interactions with the external world while simultaneously being within and outside of the data, with the aim of creating more conducive conditions for innovation in the market.

## The holistic view under pressure 

In 2014, Google hosted a debate between the creators of Lean Startup and Design Thinking entitled *Lean Startup Meets Design Thinking*. In this debate, author Eric Ries sets the stage and elaborates how many of these lean processes are well intended, on one hand: 

<!-- 

## reference

Google for Startups. (2014). Lean Startup Meets Design Thinking [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvFnHzU4_W8

--> 

> *"Grab the design silo, and they have read Tim’s book, and if they understand what a modern approach design looks like, you will see kind of design thinking that he mentioned. Grab marketing, you will see customer development. If you grab operations, you will see some dev ops.. You might find an organization where at every silo, things are very iterative, customer centric, and where people are really focused on learning." - Eric Ries (Google for Startups, 2014, 11:14)

[^designthinking]: *Design Thinking* is a process aligned with other "lean" or "agile" methods but originated from the world of design and which is also applicable in a broader context to support teams to innovate. https://hbr.org/2008/06/design-thinking

While, on the other hand, coherence between deparments remains a major problem that prevents innovation from happening: 

> "*But then, zoom out and you will say “wow, this must be a really adaptable, learning oriented company, this is fantastic.” But actually, what you will see in a lot of companies, is, although there all this iteration learning happening at each individual silo, the actual work product that company produces, is passed binder to binder from each silo to the next, in a totally linear and old school waterfall style approach. “* — Eric Ries (Google for Startups, 2014, 11:14)

According to Eric, the leaders of these departments believe that if they could control the other departments, things would be much easier. In other words, the view from within their silo gives them hope that their agile methodologies are sufficient to ensure the overall success. However, the challenge for CEOs lies in harmonizing these silos — they struggle with the art of choreography, which operates between the products of the silos' work:

> *"Of course, everybody in all the silos are saying that, and, for modern managers that can be really challenging. So, for me, my aspiration for Lean Startup is not to have people adopt it as yet another silo approach, but rather to take these common elements, that are common to design thinking, and to agile, and to lean, and certain apply them at a system-wide, at the company level, so that we have a common framework for understanding what are the problems, a common approach for the process that we are going to use to solve those problems, and most importantly, we can speak the language of business to say “he are the concrete financial and business outcomes that we can achieve if we work in this way”"*. — Eric Ries{id: author-eric-ries-200-600-f2} (Google for Startups, 2017, [XX:YY](https://medium.com/@taboca/disconnection-from-the-everyday-works-purpose-7c4b29d861d9))

This concern with the unity, or lack thereof, among company departments can serve as a basis for exploring the problem that entrepreneurs also face when dealing with agile processes in the early stages of their startups. In this context, there obviously are no silos, or various departments. At the beginning, there is no product, nor customers. The only thing entrepreneurs have are their initial hypotheses. According to Steve Blank, a startup is an institution in the discovery phase [^author-steveblankstartup].

[^author-steveblankstartup]: Steve Blank had considered the fundamental difference from a large company and a startup, emphasizing that a startup is an entity in the process of discovery, primarily working to validate its initial hypotheses in an uncertain environment. For more details, read *A Startup is Not a Smaller Version of a Large Company* from Steve Blank (2010).

### The breakdown of the holistic view 

Imagine a professional that was allowed to make interviews and to bring data, thus was kept safe in a sylo. But the professional did her best, brought data and a conclusion that would provoke the higher-order system. This professional, when it completes, submits her work to the higher-order judges that happen to find other conflicting values in accepting the experiment as done. This situation brought up a tension as the assumption of the higher-order was that the new data would provoke the whole system in course. Would then the employee be rewarded how in this case? This brings about the complications that people are engaged in being someone and that being someone is configured with settings where they are biased to please. 

In another startup setting, a chief designer recruited two UX experience designers to conduct usability tests. However, when the results were presented, the chief designer felt offended and took the feedback as criticism to her own work. This situation raises a concern: should a designer avoid conducting usability tests to prevent defensive reactions? The case illustrates the potential for conflict and in this story the subordinate designer felt frustrated as her work would not be welcomed although she even invested more than usual to do a good job. This would be a situation of a job position that would be jeopardized by the unconverings of a subordinate's well done work because of lack of transparency about potential outcomes and general commitment with purpose from all parts. 

These are situations of a complex work setting with multiple people and where it is important to map the values that are influencing everyone's work. 

The finding of learning experiments are valid but a lack of purpose happens as the team in the sylo is not exposed to higher purposes and values affecting which makes the experiment grain concreteness for its own survival, as a reaction. In other words, if under a lack of general purpose, which would create the basis of wiser and wider view, the experiment and its validated learnings gain too much value, in comparison. 

> *“It’s easy for us, to kind of get lost and forget what the purpose of our work everyday is. I think a lot of the waste in the modern work environment has to do with people that become disconnected from what is that purpose, what is the greater meaning of the work that we do.”* [Eric Ries @ 10m35s](https://youtu.be/bvFnHzU4_W8?t=10m35s) Lean Startup Meets Design Thinking






* Uma hipótese é que ele estava com medo, por exemplo diante do que ele achou que era esperado da sua posição — por exemplo medo do seu trabalho ser julgado e sua posição ser colocada em risco. Esta situação, caso fosse uma realidade, relaciona-se com cultura da empresa e também com a comunicação das iniciativas já que o designer-chefe poderia ter trabalhado com seus superiores para que estivesse tudo bem em encontrar erros.

* A ideia do processo todo é de encontrar aprendizado.

* Uma questão colocada, neste sentido, foi a questão do tempo e pressão. Ou seja, existem condições onde os especialistas estão com uma agenda fazendo pressão. E nesta situação, comentamos que é sempre o melhor que existam dois eixos. Um eixo de aprendizado e um eixo de execução. E faz parte do desenvolvimento lean, orientado ao aprendizado, a situação de aprender, anotar, crescer; e as vezes entregar outra coisa mas sem esconder o aprendizado, ou seja, permitindo uma opção para versões futuras e mantendo o investimento do aprendizado como pauta viva.

## Entrepreneurial attention deficit 

<!-- Steve's additional research 

* https://steveblank.com/2011/08/15/theres-always-a-plan-b/

--> 

Let us consider that how a team engages with lean may also put the interpretation at risk, by the very situation that any experiment will be limited and that subjective analysis is a must. This inclination, when recognized, will also push the entrepreneurs into overfocusing on the experiment in an attempt to make the data speaks louder than the subjective values outstanding which could cause interference [^footnote_subjectiveness_risk]. This situation could provoke founders and teams into the denial of the very subjective analysis which should be actually based on values, and priciples. 

[^footnote_subjectiveness_risk]: And it would be a quite valid interference if a team considers that lean means precision, as in data or that has rigor as a process, and contrasts with opinions or other subjective interactions with no formality around. In other words, it is difficult to compare an approach of discovery, such as lean that is mature and fits the frames of methodologies, with other interpretations that are ambiguous and may not have a formal framework that can incorporate subjectiveness back into the situation. 

MAP14 public forum, 2014, Australia – Rohan Workman interviewed Steve Blank and asked whether the popularization of lean movements reveals entrepreneurs who claim to do lean but actually don't. Steve Blank had not only acknowledged the situation as a of disorder that affects founders and had illustrated an example of an extremme situation: 

> *"A founder goes out of the building, hears something from a customer. Comes back to his poor company and announces — we need to pivot! we need to pivot! and we need to pivot again!"* (Steve Blank, MAP14, 2014, 24m10s)

For Steve, the idea of "pivoting" is used by founders as an excuse for an attention deficit that affects founders. From this observation, he created the "Rule of 72 Hours" to help entrepreneurs reflect on the situation:

> “Keeping your mouth shut, from when you think you got an insight to when you are allowed to announce the word pivot, inside your company.” (Steve Blank{id: author-steve-blank-200-600-g2} @ MAP14, 2014, 24m34s)

The Rule of 72 Hours is a joke-reminder. It assists entrepreneurs in remembering that they are subject to this attention deficit which diverts them from their major goal. They might become enchanted with one or another activity in the agile process and lose focus on the broader objective. When they do so, their experiments cease to be scientific, or to accept the needed broader perspective for any scientific attempt that is done under limited conditions. As example of the broader perspective tied to the very process of lean, one would prevent the immediatism with the realization that “one data point is not enough.” 

But in reality, in the field, it's not easy. Consider, for example, a situation following of a team agenda where the need to succeed, or progress, is outstanding, and the team's prior situation had involved a lot of involvement being in the room, such as focusing on idealizations, hypothesis, and more. Therefore, in this case, the very movement of going out, or as Steve would say "get out from the building" is already fascinating as the courage or proactive movement to talk with someone is not only fascinating but much better if contrasted with the prior movement. In other words, while the CEO would arrive with a let's pivot, she would likely to be applauded if the whole team where asking her to get out for months already. 

Thus, tests are conducted with a critical tone that selects or validates, pressured by a connection with numbers or projections of a final product. In this process, teams might lose the connection with the greater purpose that brought them together in the first place. Or they may respond to the numbers and stumble upon product variations, or pivot to other directions almost arbitrarily, or become demotivated by the data from their experiments, which were very significant in terms of numbers, among other situations. In this regard, the realization of one data point is too big, too strong, is actually vital - and likely fatal too - as the data point does not come isolated from the ongoing and outstanding needs and pressures.  

Or to map the forces in the illustration, since we are not in the situation, and safely can freely reflect and idealize scenarions, we shall consider the potential latent need, or pain, of the team asking for the founder to get out given that the team had spent a lot idealizing; the inclination of a founder to get the data because they were doing too much subjective analysis, which may involve a potential denial and allowance of subjective analysis, which could also lead to looking at the not enough data as in enough data and better than subjectiveness to a point of blinding the team from context, from having a wider perspective, such as to see that the experiment data could be a total flaw, ignore the wider context that holds the team together, the wider purpose, nuanced interpretations, analysis without pressure, and more. 

### Fusion with the critic  

As discussed in the corporate situation, the values of lean projects executed by teams, as in their syloes, can find a tension when the data and propositions may fail to understand the forces that can change the applicability and investments further. For example, consider the situation that Eric Ries has illustrated in The Startup Way  a team need to achieve their goals, whether individual or group, as they need to perform their work in light of expected objectives, they may defend against the potential change of direction proposed by a discovery - a conflict with the situation of learning from lean processes.

Therefore, the situation brings about the complication and the need to a wider view and discussion. One possible is exactly the paradox of why a company is doing lean if the results of it will provoke a reaction of another nature - which would make it necessary to understand the very subject of purpose which is what makes everyone working, what keeps them working, and how these forces, such as values, will interfere. 

Furthermore, this confrontation of interests may also appear in any stages such as the situation of a small team or even at the individual level, thus it may give us to opportunity to see it as a fusion. A reflection about the early  company struggle, the apparent sign of trouble, can be identified by the indicated conflict that a founder may have found as they fight with the data the the realization of "they just don't get it" when they are focusing on the vision; and alltogether the eventual realization of "they might be right" which shows that they had defined a responsibility to the duty of lean in the first place. This situation shows how the lean experiment can be fragile in as things are not clear, in front of a perception of clear vision. But, on the other hand, quite strong, if the responsibility of doing lean acts as a stronger criticism. The reality is that “one data point is not enough” as indicated by Steve, is strong enough, tough, to cause change of path in a development in both situations - either trusting too much lean data or the full denial. 

Let us consider how to tame the critic, therefore to allow room for external interactions where data chimes in, and where the critical analysis is deferred to later, with a more conscious and friendly secondary phase, such as of what a conscious board would do. 

As indicated by Steve Blank, the other extremme is a reaction of a great founder that after looking at the data come to the realization that "they just don't get the idea". But down the line, he adds, the founder thinks, "ah, maybe they're trying to tell me something". (Steve Blank, 2014, MAP Unimelb 26m49s)

The inspiration to this model is taken from the situation of a writer that may attempt to get feedback but as she does, runs the risk of listening too much to the market and become either blocked or too tied to the market data, in the case of the writer the arbitrary critic that was invited. This complexity requires, as recommended by Julia Cameron, that a writer is nurturing readers, thus to be free from the critic that is unconscious, not free of any critic, the friendly critic in the model of Julia Cameron allows for the text to improve towards it's vision with compassion and support: 

> *"It is very important that we keep a few nurturing readers as friends to our work quite apart from whatever is going on in our publishing life. We need people who are happy to hear a poem or an essay for its own sake and not as career maneuaveurs. The part of us that writes must be allowed to write freely and not always with an eye to the market. An eye to the market is part of the writing life, but if it is too large a part, it shuts down invention and leads to the blockage of many valuable avenues of exploration which are not - at first blush - commercial." (Julia Cameron, 1998, p.181)

The startup version of that support can be created and a conscious point of view for the analysis of lean data may be proposed as: Data that is taken is taken but it does not mean that actions are immediately taken. The analysis of what to do needs a point of view of support which takes in consideration the values, the vision, a wider view. Exactly because one data point is not enough, one data point can't either be too strong to impact positively or negatively. Being one or a lot of data points, a supporting role must exist which is never unaware of the team values, team vision, team beliefs. 

### Considerations about anchoring 

Although we have reflected about the need to be aware about purpose, to establish the clear conversation about the team's purpose, it does not mean that purpose is not acting anyway, as we have considered, as a force. For the sake of identifying the force that may affect results of lean experiments, we shall consideer the team, anchoring, as an element that may happen due to purpose, or values, and can affect interpretations. 

Let's start by talking about the "Business Model Canvas," the popular lean tool developed by Alexander Osterwalder that was designed for learning about potential business models, although entrepreneurs run the risk of using it promote advancement, as if it means status, like credits. I ended up idealizing an article, mainly the title of it, as "never send a canvas to your investor," while driving car when my partner seating next to me said that her colleague had sent an image of a *Canvas* via WhatsApp. At that moment, a wave of adrenaline surged through my body, mainly materialized as the title to the article, which is a simple idea but highlights a phenomenon that at times, entrepreneurs are not using the *Canvas* to its constructive potential, to learn, to iterate ideas, and often simply fall victim to its destructive potential where they misuse as in promoting, presenting, likely as a result of their urge towards progressing. To be fair, perhaps whoever sent that Canvas was just inviting her to change that Canvas, therefore to learn. As a side note, on the day when I got that article published on a publication, the CEO had replied to me saying "I just did," likely confirming our urge to use the canvas to tell the story that seems coherent. And it does, doesn't it? As one shall be very happy to see how the *Canvas* has that built-in value - coherence by its nine building blocks [^footnote_businessmodelcanvas].

[^footnote_businessmodelcanvas]: The Business Model Canvas, developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is a strategic management template used for developing new business models and documenting existing ones. It consists of nine building blocks that together provide a coherent story of a business's key elements. These building blocks include customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure. It's important to note that the primary purpose of the Business Model Canvas is not to serve as a tool for presenting a business or convincing stakeholders after the canvas is completed. Rather, it is a framework for understanding and designing business models.

--> 

Therefore the case of the *Canvas* is interesting exactly because it is simple, and its aspect of coherent elements which supports storytelling. And although that support is first meant to allow a wider view, such as to set the team to do their homework in a number of areas, the very homework feeding back the Canvas supports coherence again, thus adds value, or fidelity to the *Canvas* and then it becomes a picture, or a photo, likely with the benefits and risks of the knowing that a picture is worth a thousand words. 

A stronger, or more colored illustration of a founder driven by the *Canvas* has happened when I was in a role of a observer in a three-day Business Canvas workshop given at a local accelerator in Brazil. The professor had asked the participants to modify their Canvas projects. They were six teams and had a limited amount of time to do the exercise. The idea given by the professor seemed nice, as it provoked the teams to create a variation of their *Canvas* by setting a provocation, such as forcing a limitation, which aligns with strategies used by creativity exercises where new ideas can be discovered by forcing certain limits, adding or subtracting features. As a side note and context for how excited I was to see what next, I had once joined a delightful course on creativity where all the participants had to come up with a restaurant. Our professor asked all of us to feed the blackboard in a brainstorming with all that is known that a restaurant has such as: money, tables, plates, waiters, and all. Right after, he had given us fifteen minutes and the task to create an unique restaurant. But to help us, he had taken some key features for each team, such as "team A, you can't use money." At the end of the exercise every single team had created an amazing restaurant idea.

But my excitement didn't last even five minutes in this episode where founders needed to change their projects. From the six teams, only two had accepted to do anything. As I moved across the room, observing the inactivity of teams, I broke the observer rule and asked one of the founders why they weren't trying. The CEO had replied that they wouldn't do because they had won a contest or some other confirmation that they were right, just the night before. I looked to the co-founder, a software developer. He had a sad look in his face. I literally moved away, slowly and moving backwards looking at them and not knowing what to say. They were anchored by that last night. 

The *Canvas*, as a process, doesn't want to give you a winning *Canvas*. It has no date, no promise, like any *lean* process which the central idea is learning, not validation. And if any hint of validation is there, it may be so in alignment with the idea of validated learning, not validation to the business. Steve Blank, in Customer Development (Four Steps to the Epiphany), emphasizes the search part of the process as one that returns to the beginning, designed to go backward, like many other lean processes. But, again and again, entrepreneurs want to move forward. The positive sense of urgency that becomes a villain. And in this sense, a fundamental point of the whole story is worth mentioning - that the act of entrepreneurship is both science and art that must be led by those who are willing, prepared, and have a strong connection with the idea, with the merit.

#### Considerations of selective pressure 

While, on one hand, Canvas and other Lean processes indicate the cycle that should be repeated, on the other hand, the entrepreneur, or teams responsible for the discovery process, are setting dates and creating criteria with a clear objective: to move forward. The very complexity for teams doing these processes is that the room for purpose can also be filled with the how the gatekeepers of growth judge, if not themselves. 

Therefore and even if perfection is never real, some nuanced realization of scoring, or being perfect for a given purpose, may create a risk, such as when the discovery makes the eyeballs of a judge, like an investor, to grow. It's in a way unavoidable that founders looking into their eyes will see the growth opportunity ahead. 

The truth in the space is that this support, or selected pressure, happens from many angles, like due to when money and resources run out, co-founders disagree, the next round of investment never happens, or simply the product doesn't sell, and more. In other words, it's the voice from the pipeline ahead that can affirm. If it works, move forward; if it fails, give up. There's no time to do Lean as it should be done, not at all with a wider view about purpose. 

To illustrate growth forces, consider the perspective given by Howard Hartenbaum, in "Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital," (Stanford, 2013) where he had recognized that some teams are "precedents driven" in the sense of an alighment with the 10000-hour rule [^footnote_10000hour_rule] and likely with a deeper understanding of the underlying problem even at a philosophical level [^footnote_reid_phisolophy]. But one thing is to consider the team's involvement at that level of depth; but another is the very observation that top-tier venture capital firms are not only aware but actually quite involved in doing their homework, such as research about the potencial changes that are happening to the world. In other words, it has to do with the jobs of their partners, the homework of identifying risks and opportunities for investment which depends on using their minds and all the resources they can to advance their understanding about potential transformations. To illustrate how real is this, consider the situation depicted by Brad Stone in his 2017 book, "The Upstarts: How Uber, Airbnb, and the Killer Companies of the New Silicon Valley Are Changing the World," when Sequoia [^footnote_sequoia_capital] wanted to invest in a ride sharing business in the east of United States which didn't work because the CEO had refused to stay away from yellow cabs which was a concern and fear brought up by Sequoia. On the other hand, Sequoia moved on, and end up investing in a team from San Francisco, California, Uber, a team focusing on black cars, like limo service; although Sequoia were quite interested to know that the founders would be okay to scale towards yellow cabs when the moment was right.

In conclusion, the illustration is a reminder that strong thesis about the future, and even the inclination of bigger bets by investors, or customer's interest, can become supporting forces that be either mess up with values lean experiments or support. 


## Expanding the horizon 

<!-- check sb suggestion board case, reflect on that --> 

Since awareness is key to any process, and founders generally suffer from being enamored with the process, it becomes the founder’s responsibility first to recognize such syndrome; then second, to find for ways to ensure the process is running with quality.

But the problem with quality is always in knowing which criteria to use for these situations that can be really adverse. In Steve Blank’s suggestion, founders should find a board of directors or an advisory board: The body responsible for from an outside perspective therefore supporting the founder to get out from instant pressures, and compromising decisions.

The key to executing the process is to do it first without holding the agenda for the success (for the business or the idea.) Success, for the process, is most likely the case of learning new information (good or bad.) When going out, or trying to be systematic about the data you get, you need to be genuine to the cause (the bold vision) but at the same time recognize uncertainty and that learning will help you out in the long run.

And the same may also apply to what the founder would get as failure. In Scott Belsky’s Making Ideas Happen, a reading about failure does not have to be a dead end:

> “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity. Stay strong and stay calm as a situation settles itself over time and the clouds around any period of change start to dissipate. “ (Scott Belsky, 2010, Making Ideas Happen)

### Release of control and access to move on 

No mundo onde vários colaboradores estão executando suas ações debaixo de grande pressão (por exemplo resultante de indicadores chave, agenda, metas e ainda levando em consideração as agendas e tendências específicas das especialidades dos colaboradores) acontece que as vezes grupos se encontram diante de opções divergentes.

* Marcio colocou a história que ele viveu quando fez um contrato para o projeto SongBird, da Califórnia. O pessoal do Songbird contratou ele para fazer um tema de design para o aplicativo de música. O Marcio tentou seguir algumas especificações mas no final do dia acabou fazendo um sistema para criar vários temas coloridos. No final do mês o SongBirg novo foi lançado com um outro tema, não o do Márcio; foi quando o Márcio descobriu que haviam dois contratos sendo executados em paralelo.

* Fabrício indicou sobre a situação onde pode-se optar por caminhos A ou B, mas ao mesmo tempo existe o problema da falta de tempo ou de recursos limitados.

* Marcio apontou o caso do Andy Groove em High Output Management, que aponta que reuniões devem procurar permitir que as melhores ideias possam surgir, ou seja, não é importante que exista um consenso na questão das ideias, mas sim na parte da decisão para execução. Um time deve procurar melhores ideias, e mesmo que uma pessoa seja favorecida, o outro (ideia oposta) deve estar colaborando depois da decisão do todo. Essa ideia em geral deve ser algo comprado (buy-in) pelos colaboradores antes dos processos criativos, ou seja, preparando eles para a situação de aprendizado e para a posterior execução.






* Put MD case of Disney 

Em geral, poucos empreendedores têm coragem para investir o tempo nesse tipo de esforço. Outros fazem pior ao se convencerem que a execução das atividades  ágeis por si só significa sucesso. E assim eles dizem “Ah, eu fiz o processo do *canvas*” ou “Estou fazendo o processo correto das entrevistas qualitativas” e passam a avançar em um modo acelerado que os cega de reconhecer que deveriam aprender e retroceder. Executar as metodologias ágeis é bom, mas não vale nada quando questões fundamentais não são respeitadas. Pior ainda: é quando o processo é usado errado de forma consciente e deliberada para criar uma falsa ideia, como quem usa os dados em uma apresentação para provar um ponto, mas sabe que é falso. Nessa linha, existem empreendedores de vários tipos: inocentes, encantados, e os que se enganam. Mas independente do perfil, uma coisa é certa — o negócio não sobrevive pois no final é o negócio que dita como serão as coisas.

Tirar “nota 10” em uma ou outra tarefa não implica que o empreendimento irá ganhar o jogo na partida final. Muitas vezes, lá na frente, quando chegam as grandes crises, empreendedores percebem que estavam ignorando os sinais — que os sinais estavam por toda parte mas eles não queriam enxergar. Então, o problema é similar, tanto para empreendedores como para empresas — líderes se perdem na coreografia dos processos. Nas empresas, como sugerido por Eric Ries{id: author-eric-ries-200-600-h}, a dificuldade está em harmonizar o resultado dos trabalhos dos silos funcionais ágeis. No contexto dos empreendedores, a dificuldade está em olhar por fora os “silos” da execução de atividades ágeis. ! Na fase de descoberta da startup, eles precisam ser tornar melhores generalistas; devem sobrevoar acima das suas ideias, das suas próprias paixões, dos seus produtos e até acima do mercado. Nesse sentido, devem se tornar advogados múltiplos, que defendem suas ideias mas igualmente defendem o ambiente externo que pode estar contra as suas ideias. Esse ponto de vista só tem uma intenção — mais chances para o negócio.






### Possibilities 



#### Considerations of endless cycles 

One case in situation are a scenario of possibility of the lean processes is that the team enters in a sort of endless cycles - even so temporarily - which where they might deal with doing again better, trying to be more professional about the construction of the hypothesis, and the means of tests, and they might explore specific value propositions, or their attempt to understand customers, and they might be very influenced by the very network that they are interacting with, so in a way they this is a very part of lean but it might start to bother the team that something is wrong.

#### Traces of disconnection with purpose such as mission 

The other case situation is when the team feels a disconnection with a purpose, or vision or mission - to note that in the early stages these things are not clearly distinct but nevertheless the reason that they work might connect with - and they are not comfortable anymore because the very interactions of lean takes them in a sort of new direction and it might be difficult for them to change their primary premises, or established anchors with these values, that would otherwise set them back in a promising direction which they feel connected. 

The other case is when the team may find traction that takes them in the direction or they might pivote into a promising direction where there's traction but there's certainly a disconnect with a vision and values of the founders and then they have the dilemma which is to jump out of the boat or to actually continue to run which is certainly maybe the case where they are under pressure but nevertheless they don't know if they continue to run they could actually end up in a situation of frustrations or other value-based or mission or vision based dissonance; and therefore by this interaction they may end up being less feeling in love and by that running into the possibility of being executors of a cause for money and the dissonance or the comparison with the other opportunity for them would put them in a place to not be proud of execution and not feeling as somebody in that line that demands evolving and leadership. 

(The situation of an the extremmes of Steve Blank are ) 

#### Traction in alignment with purpose 

And there's certainly the case where the interactions and the effort that the team has put in place brought data that is relevant or it means traction in the very direction in alignment with the vision they have and that at least gives them the opportunity to move on at least to another more complex configuration, towards growth, which naturally will bring ahead potential challenges related to the complexitity of the need to grow in a bigger market which they could be not a initially aware, or natural demands growth in other directions by the growth needs either driven by company values, or growth pressures driven by investors, or even the natural demands of the consumers which more and more participates, and continue to engage with evolving needs. 


## Conclusion

In terms of conclusion with these cases all of this creates the basis for a situation latent in terms of situation for latent innovation. Because it is certain that in all areas in terms of users using things for their needs, there are common needs and opportunities to organize interactions; in other words, there are things that can be improved in certainly innovation that can be applied therefore one possible conclusion is that the lean processes and certain direction of the experiments might actually suggest that lean takes care of itself while the team will have to decide if they like it or not to be in the boat or not; which connects with the points about purpose and indicated by authors such Eric Ries, and Steve blank's points about love.

The other side of interpretation has to do with the that from the general usage of lean, it might be considered that it adds the critical eye, the eye of the critic, and establishes by doing so a sort of judgment exactly by its idea of validated learning which is tied with the needs for data to advance towards growth. Bring about the theme of lean and the challenges of putting in practice when executing a startup may give us a window of opportunity to reflect about value and risks of interacting with external environment, the environment that brings the very customers and on the side participants that supports growth, which see themselves as on the side of who offers. In other words, augumentation to voices. 

And the needed viewpoint that these subjects are now relevant to the theme of lean. In other words there's so many articles and materials and consultants and coaches supporting lean executors and as this practitioners are involved in the very expertise of doing lean as in doing lean consciously, it becomes evident that the subject of controlling or being controlled by the external interactions or the when to release by the perceptions of limited external interactions, or the needs to establish a perspective on top of any interactions are part of the very subject of lean and therefore it makes lean valid because the other option would be to not care at all and continue to do so without a window of opportunity for a reflection.

Also important to note is that the many authors of resources related to the lean movement, such as the leading authors Eric Ries and Steve Blank among otghers, are in fact entrepreneurs themselves, first, and secondly they aren't careless about the movement of entrepreneurship - likely because they came upon lean discoveries by reflecting on the movements and needs. In other words, they are in the loop of lean, not as watchers but listeners of feedback that they get throughout time and which adds to them new perspectives. The very book of Eric Ries points presents a point of view that indicates that the need from a degree of view from above where the purpose is to bring back the values - as he wrote "purpose"  of the team members which may bring about values and the vision of the business and the consciousness about the ability to judge as in judgment from outside as in alignment with purpose which is very useful in the front of the potential critic that of course chimes in. And, needless to say, that any viewpoint that comes above everything is a very possibility of influencing everything.

To point an example, consider how new interpretations happen in the face of a movement that is not static, such as the article of Steve Blank that acknowledges thoughts from the Jobs to be done team of Tony Ulwick with the realization that lean processes, such as customer discovery, may be benefited from a higher awareness about what is the market, thus awareness that a demographic-based market might obfuscate the view of a team that may be trying to discover a needs-based market.
