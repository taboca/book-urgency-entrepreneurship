# Lean deficit disorder 

The lean movement has permeated in the entrepreneurial world, in the life of founders and even at large companies. It went along, with its origins two decades ago [^footnote_steveblank_origins_remark], following the needs for agility, or efficiency, in a world that needed to respond faster, more interactive, dynamic, and a world where the consumer is more involved in the innovation process where the ones living the challenges firsthand at closer to the process of creation of solutions [^footnote_ericvonhippel_democratizing_innovation]. A decade ago, Harvard Business Review and Steve Blank recognized that, although young, the movement titled "the lean start-up" were on par with various other trends [^footnote_steve_blank_agile_lean_trends] which reflected the emerging needs such as closer relationships with potential customers, openness to failure, willingness to change course, iterative learning, and more transparent accounting of the innovation process - all this to improve the old processes where elaborate pre-planning prevailed. Over time, in the last decade, the lean movement has garnered much more attention and contributed to greater efficiency in the process of innovation for the creation of products and services.

[^footnote_steveblank_origins_remark]: In *Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything,* in 2013, Steve Blank (2013) recognizes that lean startup were happening, among entrepreneurs and even recognized by large com,panies, but yet promising. He recounts the origins, and realization of his work, has happened and projected in a course at Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley in 2003, together with his book *The Four Steps to the Epiphany*. He also acknowledges the other key major developments that had supported the popularization of the wider lean movements, through the work of his students, especially the Business Model Generation written by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur, in 2010, and *The Lean Startup* by his other student Eric Ries written in 2011. 

[^footnote_steve_blank_agile_lean_trends]: In *Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything,* Steve Blank (2013) indicated how start-ups doing lean, lean start-ups, were practicing *agile development*; to make a point that the development which is iterative had alignment with the lean movement practices.

[^footnote_ericvonhippel_democratizing_innovation]: In *Democratizing Innovation,* MIT professor and author, Eric von Hippel, explores the phenomenon of User Innovation, a concept where users play an active role in the innovation process. Von Hippel argues that users, being close to their own needs and experiences, often innovate by modifying and improving products or services. This user-driven innovation blurs the traditional boundaries between consumer and producer, fostering a collaborative environment where users not only consume but also contribute to the development and improvement of products and services.

<!-- situation of lean, highlights the complication that lean solves --> 

Let's consider Lean Startup, which is a methodology where progress depends on the concept of validated learning [^footnote_leanstartup_validated_learning], becoming vital in an environment of extreme uncertainty. Lean movements have changed the standard of the traditional formula that involved writing a business plan [^footnote_steveblank_oldapproach], pitching to investors, assembling the team, launching the product, and finally sales. In other words, lean movements are present in the design phase of a startup or the work unit of large companies seeking to innovate their products or services. In other words, interaction with the external environment is intended to reduce risks and allow for larger investments, such as the justification of a more elaborate prototype. Therefore, it can be abstracted to be a process that seeks greater efficiency for the innovation process in contrast with long-term design and development, when done with static data such as hypotheses, assumptions, market research, etc., which can lead to a big surprise when launched to an audience where no one is interested. For this and other reasons, lean movements refer to the idea of less work, or less waste, with respect to resources since interaction with the external environment creates the opportunity for validated learning that reduces uncertainties that justify larger investments that are also expected by the situation of startups seeking growth. In other words, lean methodologies confer great powers since the data obtained through interactions justify investments of resources for new stages, even if the stage asks to return to the cycle again.

[^footnote_leanstartup_validated_learning]: Validated Learning is a core concept in Eric Ries's book *The Lean Startup* (Ries, 2011). It refers to a process where startups use empirical data gathered from real customers to validate their hypotheses about both the business and product. This approach emphasizes learning over mere intuition and guides startups in making decisions based on what customers actually want, thereby reducing market risks and avoiding the building of products that customers do not need

<!-- some of these seem to be pre-complications? --> 

This moment, therefore, asks for the greater responsibility that comes from the realization of the power of these methods. This because implicit of the the startup situation is that things starts small, based on hypotheses, even if the data is fragmented - or not significant - it becomes intrinsically significant in the sense that it affects the team's perceptions. In other words, the data have a strong presence, often either criticizing or applauding excessively, given that experiments are elaborated based on growth pressures and the need for searching values, or validation, or the voice of the market, which are significant elements for more investment. Additionally, it is important to contextualize that precisely because there is no market dependence, like serving conquered customers, and the team being small, agility is observable in that startups can rapidly change direction and allows for more failures to occur in the search for correct approaches, and even a high tolerance for errors to the point of becoming a value, or almost a pride for founders [^footnote_samaltman_blitzscaling_pivot_generation].

[^footnote_samaltman_blitzscaling_pivot_generation]: There are many obvious reasons to consolidate the general idea that startups are in a good position to move faster, in the sense of changing directions, as of course the initial situation starts with no market dependencies and the small team, the intentions to execute cheaper experiments, and the like. But the general idea of pivoting went further from the notion that entrepreneurs should embrace the possibility, towards a point that pivoting is promoted, as illustrated by Sam Altman's interview (Altman, 2015) which recognized that "Silicon Valley really gets the pivot thing wrong," to the point that teams brag about pivoting, which for him means bragging about failing which is different from the needed aspect of tolerance for failure.

But shouldn't agile processes provide more learning precisely because they are closer to the external environment? Yes, in theory. However, in practice, entrepreneurs execute agile activities with behaviors that could be interpreted as self-validation or self-criticism as they advance in execution. Thus, they breach a fundamental contract of the agile movement's proposal with the claim that they are doing lean while in reality they are not. Perhaps this issue can be seen as a syndrome stemming from low self-esteem; they become “perfectionists” when they want to accumulate success points and do not feel comfortable advancing with greater recognition of their problems, giving a chance to something that aligns better with objectives, values that involve accepting failures and criticisms along the way, and finding opportunities to continue learning.

This environment also raises possible questions stemming from the pressure of growth, such as why entrepreneurs do not invest time in research aimed at proving that their ideas can fail? Or, more broadly, might entrepreneurs be at risk of losing commitment to the potential of the business in terms of values and meaning? Or, are entrepreneurs committed to validating the nature of the process, the difficulties, and, for example, how the influence of their experiments, such as modeling, choice of experiments, and collected data, can alter the course of the process?

<!-- answer key line? --> 

In the search for an a conscious understanding of lean in practice, we will consider situations where the usage of lean, in the corporate and startup context, happens to cause frustrations to teams - such from observations that lean seems to be failing or not fulfilling its promises - exactly because teams focuses in lean and misses the wider view, such as how other governing forces affects lean execution and judgement. 

<!-- elaboration of key lines ahead? --> 

In the effort to develop a conscious understanding for why teams can get frustrated with lean, we will start from the corporate context, recognizing a concern where teams engage with lean processes, such as to find good traction, but the process fails in its yield real value due to lack of awareness for the values and conflicting forces in the corporate setting. 

Thereafter, we will explore a similar phenomenon of the corporate situation, although in the early stage startup, where teams can be frustrated, as the execution of lean fails to its major purpose to help the team, in the face of the team's overfocus in lean and the disconnect with subjective analysis such as their greater purpose. 

Finally, we conclude with thoughts from thinkers of the lean movement, and others who are committed to understanding the challenges of navigating interactions with the external world, to improve the awareness for executing lean within and outside of the data, or the process, with the aim of maintaining the necessary awareness of purpose which can support the innovative capacity of the team and bring a friendly understanding of lean. 

## The holistic view under pressure 

In 2014, Google hosted a debate between the creators of Lean Startup and Design Thinking entitled *Lean Startup Meets Design Thinking*. In this debate, author Eric Ries sets the stage and elaborates how many of these lean processes are well intended, on one hand: 

<!-- 

## reference

Google for Startups. (2014). Lean Startup Meets Design Thinking [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvFnHzU4_W8

--> 

> *"Grab the design silo, and they have read Tim’s book, and if they understand what a modern approach design looks like, you will see kind of design thinking that he mentioned. Grab marketing, you will see customer development. If you grab operations, you will see some dev ops.. You might find an organization where at every silo, things are very iterative, customer centric, and where people are really focused on learning."* - Eric Ries (2014, 11:14)

[^designthinking]: *Design Thinking* is a process aligned with other "lean" or "agile" methods but originated from the world of design and which is also applicable in a broader context to support teams to innovate. https://hbr.org/2008/06/design-thinking

While, on the other hand, coherence between deparments remains a major problem that prevents innovation from happening: 

> "*But then, zoom out and you will say “wow, this must be a really adaptable, learning oriented company, this is fantastic.” But actually, what you will see in a lot of companies, is, although there all this iteration learning happening at each individual silo, the actual work product that company produces, is passed binder to binder from each silo to the next, in a totally linear and old school waterfall style approach. “* - Eric Ries (2014, 11:14)

According to Eric, the leaders of these departments believe that if they could control the other departments, things would be much easier. In other words, the view from within silos gives them hope, or expectatins, that their specific agile effort is sufficient to ensure the overall success. However, the challenge from top-down is a must and lies in moving across these silos and checking the local purpose versus higher purposes. In other words, deals with the struggle of a choreography that seeks to create harmony accross working boxes: 

> *"Of course, everybody in all the silos are saying that, and, for modern managers that can be really challenging. So, for me, my aspiration for Lean Startup is not to have people adopt it as yet another silo approach, but rather to take these common elements, that are common to design thinking, and to agile, and to lean, and certain apply them at a system-wide, at the company level, so that we have a common framework for understanding what are the problems, a common approach for the process that we are going to use to solve those problems, and most importantly, we can speak the language of business to say “he are the concrete financial and business outcomes that we can achieve if we work in this way."* — - Eric Ries (2014, 11:14)

This concern with the unity, or lack thereof, among company departments can serve as a basis for exploring the problem faced by all levels - in large companies or smaller settings where entrepreneurs are dealing with agile processes. 

### The breakdown of the holistic view 

Imagine a professional that was allowed to make interviews and to bring data, thus was safe to operate in her own silo, like a mission which is good in the sense of "if you choose to accept this mission" with the benefits of operability. But as the mission unfolds, as the professional did her best, the data brings about a potential conclusion that could provoke the higher-order system. Therefore, as she submits the work to the higher-order, judges happen to bring about conflicting values. Now if this situation brings a tension, such as to provoke the current flow and the whole system in course, would then this employee be rewarded in this case? This brings about the complications that people are engaged in being someone and that being someone involves doing a good job and that doing a good job can be the very source of bring about chaos in the life of the doer such as living the pressures to please or not to please. 

As an illustration inspired by a startup setting, consider a chief designer that has recruited an *User Experience Designer* to conduct an experiment involving interviews with people. However, as the results were presented, the chief designer felt offended - she took the feedback as criticism to her own prior work. This situation raises a concern: should the hired designer avoid conducting some of the activities in order to prevent defensive reactions? The case illustrates the potential for conflict. In this story, the subordinate designer felt frustrated too, as her work would not be welcomed and considering that she had invested more time beyond the usual. This situation exposes frustrations as it pulls the participants to consider that their job positions could be jeopardized by the unconverings of a subordinate's well done work. Which, in other words, may mean a degree of lack of transparency about potential outcomes, or the interpretation of outcomes, and the general commitment with purpose from all parts. 

These are situations of a complex work setting with multiple people and where it is important to map the values that are influencing everyone's work. Consider the concern of Eric Ries: 

> *“It’s easy for us, to kind of get lost and forget what the purpose of our work everyday is. I think a lot of the waste in the modern work environment has to do with people that become disconnected from what is that purpose, what is the greater meaning of the work that we do.”* - Eric Ries (2014, 10:35)

The finding of learning experiments are valid but a lack of purpose happens as the team in the silo is not exposed to higher purposes and values affecting as actually the purpose for everyone involved is controlled by higher-order purposes such as how the organization measures and evaluates their work. In other words, if under a lack of general purpose that transcends the job done, the experiment and its learnings gain too much attention or it gains concrenetess to be subjectivelly judged from the point of view of the doer but objectivelly judged by the other current acting forces of the higher-order. In other words, the system reacts and it may do so brutally as the tension is exposed. To make things worse, this tension may be exposed not clearly and in the hallways, as opposed to be part of the discussion of the lean experiment acting in the current.  

## Entrepreneurial attention deficit 

After having considered the disconnect with purpose in the situation of teams, it remains as a question if the smaller setting situation of a young setup these complications would go away. If turn our attention to one entrepreneur, or a smaller team, it is clear that the setting of discovery [^author-steveblankstartup] - different from the large organization - have no silos, or departments; likely not even a product, nor a market, neither customers. Therefore, apparently no conflicting values and a general well-intended purpose. 

[^author-steveblankstartup]: Steve Blank had considered the fundamental difference from a large company and a startup, emphasizing that a startup is an entity in the process of discovery, primarily working to validate its initial hypotheses in an uncertain environment; while large business would generally execute a business model. For more details, read *A Startup is Not a Smaller Version of a Large Company* from Steve Blank (2010).

But we shouldn't assume that the early stage doesn`t carry any seed that may grow into a tree of complications as discussed. To develop this consideration, we may start by recognizing that lean processes are welcomed by entrepreneurs, that there is a latent need for rigor, such as to advance with supporting data. This need may come from the situation of improved agility - as suggested and opposed to the inneficient movement of a large corporations - that sets them into a position to move too fast in arbitrary directions. This idea can be supported if we consider the nature of the dynamic and iterative environment encountered through the lean movements, agile development, which also does along with digital platforms supporting faster prototyping and development, such as of software and design processes [^footnote_steveblank_lower_costs], which pulls faster development, faster maintenance, and management. In other words, that the development cycles are faster because of the digital interactions enabling collaboration, such as the level of collaboration and resources available by the open-source movement. In other words, startups are faster but with speed they can also be fast to grow any system, which would push them to be concerned of the possibility of growing a snowball in arbitrary directions - which is where they would be a victim of the movement potential. 

[^footnote_steveblank_lower_costs]: A decade ago, Steve Blank, in  *Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything* (2013), had concluded how the cost and dynamics of building a startup had changed: "Today open source software, like GitHub, and cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services, have slashed the cost of software development from millions of dollars to thousands. Hardware start-ups no longer have to build their own factories, since offshore manufacturers are so easily accessible. Indeed, it’s become quite common to see young tech companies that practice the lean start-up methodology offer software products that are simply “bits” delivered over the web or hardware that’s built in China within weeks of being formed. "

The other drive to an interest in lean would be the realization that the begining shows a higher degree of subjectiveness, given by strong notions associated with vision, or passion, and the like. Therefore, the in front of too many hypothesis, too many ideas, and even hallucinations [^footnote_steveblank_hallucinations], plus the possibility of advancing with productizing such as prototyping and growing digital creations, the young team fears the risks, feels the dangers of bets, such as working in arbitrary ways; or avoiding the things that are ambiguous and subjective. With this, a natural response under the pressure for agility, and what becomes the outstanding question of what to do, pushes teams to value and engage with methods that supports progressing in less subjective ways and more rigor. In other words, the principles of lean [^footnote_eric_ries_leanstartup_principles] such as of validated learning, innovation accounting, and build-measure-learn; sounds coherent. Now, if coherence by principles are an invitation, the full ticket to the trip follows as a given method is proven, and offers a depth or richness in terms of rigor, needless to say if it is acessible and doesn't require months of learning to get start, or as the community loves to say "up to speed." 

[^footnote_steveblank_hallucinations]: Steve Blank illustrates that the visions of founders are visions, are dreams, not disconnected from the situation of "a calling". The metaphor that founders hallucinate given by Steve makes that point. 

But, of course, all of that can't be problem. Except that the responsibily lies in the hands of the drivers, and even when they do so with all the good intentions, a complication comes when the inclination towards these methods of rigor, which favors the perspective for rigorous analysis, takes the attention away from keeping the subjective considerations, or in an extremme scenario, to push the team into the full denial of any subjective interpretation.

--> 

An illustration of this problem was brought by the interview where Rohan Workman asked0 Steve Blank whether the popularization of lean movements reveals entrepreneurs who claim to do lean but actually don't. Steve Blank had acknowledged the problem as a disorder that affects founders, and had illustrated an example of an extremme situation: 

> *"A founder goes out of the building, hears something from a customer. Comes back to his poor company and announces — we need to pivot! we need to pivot! and we need to pivot again!"* Steve Blank (MAP14, 2014, 24m10s)

For Steve, the idea of "pivoting" is used by founders as an excuse for an attention deficit that affects founders. From this observation, he created the "Rule of 72 Hours" to help entrepreneurs reflect on the situation, which consisted of “Keeping your mouth shut, from when you think you got an insight to when you are allowed to announce the word pivot, inside your company.” (MAP14, 2014, 24m10s)

The point of "The Rule of 72 Hours" works like a joke and reminder and it is intended to assist entrepreneurs in remembering that they are subject to this attention deficit which diverts them from their major goal. They might become victium of one or another activity of the agile process and lose focus about the broader perspective, the objective, or the purpose. When they do so, their experiments cease to be scientific in the sense of the needed level of rigor for anything that demands rigor [^footnote_marcio_white_papers_humble]; doing a small experiment would need to recognize the flaws and the perspective that all that was done happened under limited conditions. As an example of the broader perspective, one would be interested in preventing the immediatism with the realization that “one data point is not enough.” 

[^footnote_marcio_white_papers_humble]: In scientific research, particularly white papers, the level of responsibility and thoroughness is a critical element that often leads to conclusions acknowledging potential flaws, as limitations, which matches the formality and structure of the publications and scientific community. This is also a commitment to integrity which other limitations are also discussed as "future work." 

But in reality, in the field, it's not easy. Consider, for example, a situation following of a team agenda where the need to succeed, or progress, is outstanding, and the team's prior situation had involved a lot of involvement being in the room, such as focusing on idealizations, hypothesis, and more. Therefore, in this case, the very movement of going out, or as Steve would say "get out from the building" sounds quite fascinating, idealistically and in terms of expectations, because the value of acessing data from the real world become a very good reason in contrast with poor and prior movement of using resources "in the building" which would sound like navigating blindly. In other words, to illustrate a complication, while the CEO arrives announcing the "let's pivot," she might not get a "Hold your horses, you've got The Rule of 72 Hours!" She might get instead, hugs and claps by the whole crew, as they where the ones crying out for that job of duty, in the first place.  

In other words, the team falls into the tracks of what seems to be a rigorous process, inclined focus on the experiments, and the process, with strong intentions to make the data speak louder, with all the good intentions which are supported by what seems to be a responsible intention - like a driving that requires the driver to look in mirror, fasten the seat belt, check the pressure of tires, and the like, follow the rule book, and the like. Moreover, these experiments, and such "responsible driving" are conducted with a critical tone, if not a pompous tone, which then pushes the very same team, responsible for evaluating themselves, into a judgemental mindset that engages in selecting, or validating, like judges of a contest that puts a grade, pressured by a need to collect the numbers that look impressive, and that seem to be supporting of final product - like vanity metrics [^footnote_eric_ries_vanity_metrics].

[^footnote_eric_ries_vanity_metrics]: Vanity metrics, as discussed by Eric Ries in his Lean Startup methodology, refer to data points that look impressive on paper but do not necessarily correlate with the metrics that really matter in business, such as those that reflect true growth, revenue, and customer engagement. These metrics can often be misleading, as they offer a superficially positive view of a company's performance while failing to provide insights into sustainable success or long-term viability.

Failing with lean is, therefore, quite a real danger, because from the eyes of an external entity that could see the ride from above the team lacks responsibility. While, on the other hand and in reality in the day, the team may be supressing such objections right upfront as they claim to be driving responsibly. This is a situation where the team drives with a potentially disconnecting with the purpose, inline with the idea from Eric Ries. Or, inline with the idea of Steve Blank, they can be perceived as under a setting of an attention deficit. 

Aside from these abstractions and metaphors, interpretations, the situation in the average day is sensed by the voices of observers - such as the the voice that escapes the heat of the hour - that say things like "watch out for over focusing in the process" or "watch out for being enamorated with the process." 

Thus, we here celebrate an alarm for the possibility that the experience of running with lean, driven by the intents to counterbalance subjectiveness, pushes a small team, or even a solo founder, into simplifying the view of purpose through the binoculars that looks to data, as a function of the data, and the process; which can make it difficult to do lean with awareness about how we are doing lean, an awareness that would consider values, principles, vision, and team's higher purpose. In this way or operation, teams might lose the connection with the greater purpose that brought them together in the first place. Or they may respond to the numbers and stumble upon product variations, or pivot to other directions almost arbitrarily, or become demotivated by the data from their experiments, which were very significant in terms of numbers, among other situations. In this regard, the realization of one data point is too big, too strong, is actually vital - and likely fatal too - as the data point does not come isolated from the ongoing and outstanding needs and pressures.

--> 

Or to map the forces in the illustration, since we are not in the situation, and safely can freely reflect and idealize scenarions, we shall consider the potential latent need, or pain, of the team asking for the founder to get out given that the team had spent a lot idealizing; the inclination of a founder to get the data because they were doing too much subjective analysis, which may involve a potential denial and allowance of subjective analysis, which could also lead to looking at the not enough data as in enough data and better than subjectiveness to a point of blinding the team from context, from having a wider perspective, such as to see that the experiment data could be a total flaw, ignore the wider context that holds the team together, the wider purpose, nuanced interpretations, analysis without pressure, and more. 

### Fusion with the critic  

Furthermore, this confrontation of interests may also appear in any stages such as the situation of a small team or even at the individual level, thus it may give us to opportunity to consider a notion of fusion; which is a tension where multiple roles with different interests appear in the setting of a minimal entity of work that would apparently look to be confused. A reflection about the early company struggle, the apparent sign of trouble, can be identified by the indicated conflict that a founder may have found as they fight with the data the the realization of "they just don't get it" (MAP14, 2014) when they are focusing on the vision; and alltogether the eventual realization of "they might be right" which shows that they had defined a responsibility to the duty of lean in the first place. This situation shows how the lean experiment can be fragile in as things are not clear, in front of a perception of clear vision. But, on the other hand, quite strong, if the responsibility of doing lean acts as a stronger criticism. The reality is that “one data point is not enough” as indicated by Steve, is strong enough, tough, to cause change of path in a development in both situations - either trusting too much lean data or the full denial. 

Let us consider how to tame the critic, therefore to allow room for external interactions where data chimes in, and where the critical analysis is deferred to later, with a more conscious and friendly secondary phase, such as of what a conscious board would do. 

To illustrate this situation of fusion of the doer and the critic, consider a situation of an aspiring writer that needs feedback as writting happens. As she engages with others seeking feedback, she also engages in overlistening to a point of internalizing the voice fo the critic, even to a point of being blocked by the very criticism. This complex situation gains an enlighted viewpoint with the wisdom of Julia Cameron given by The Right to Write - as she points a case of Terrence, a writer that became blocked by interacting with a professional editor: 

> *"Although we seldom think of it this way, a writer's block is often very healthy self-protective on the part of our inner creator to a dangerous threat. Terrence's inner writer refused to have his work misread and mutilated."* Julia Cameron (1998, p.180)

But it turns out that the criticism, such as that negative criticism that mutilates the work, is really tied to how one internalizes what was told, like voice of the market. In other words, when it happens like as if the data is too strong, or too brutal, it might happen under a latent potential for criticism which is outstanding in the first place by the situation, like expectations, of the doer. Therefore, is not unlikely that the incident is so brutal that one can't even reflect about what has happened, such as being aware that what was shown wasn't ready to be exposed to that particular kind of critisicm, such as that the doer might have engaged with anyone under the assumption that the criticism would advance smoothly, such as that one had invited a quite arbitrary reviewer, such as one that is also not conscious, or even aware, that the text is under construction may actually needed to be seen in perspective. In other words, the writer-doer wasn't conscious of that in the first place. This complexity requires, as recommended by Julia Cameron, that a writer to engage in activities such as of nurturing readers, thus to be free from the critic that is unconscious, and to get involved with a critic like a friendly critic: 

> *"It is very important that we keep a few nurturing readers as friends to our work quite apart from whatever is going on in our publishing life. We need people who are happy to hear a poem or an essay for its own sake and not as career maneuaveurs. The part of us that writes must be allowed to write freely and not always with an eye to the market. An eye to the market is part of the writing life, but if it is too large a part, it shuts down invention and leads to the blockage of many valuable avenues of exploration which are not - at first blush - commercial."* Julia Cameron (1998, p.181)

This situation may appear in the life of a writer, such as of an amateur writer, that needs a helping hand to protect its work - which by the way is not really due to the criticism as given as there is no criticism as given but only the criticism as perceived. Therefore, the notion of fusion comes from the tension, or the dissonance that arises in the self. Similarly, as we move on with the next two sections, let's consider cases of startups that offers an opportunity to further reflect about forces of acting values affecting the team, as an entity, which sets them in conditions to miss the purpose, to protect their work from these forces and their perceptions that are formed by the pressures of growth. 

#### Anchoring 

Moving towards the startup situation, a small team, let us consider how a natural lack of discussion about purpose happens as an intrusion of forces which can be confused with values or purpose. What I have named *Anchoring* is a name for when a team sets in given direction because something seem right, although unexpected. 

To elaborate this situation, let us consider the popular lean tool *Business Model Canvas*[^footnote_businessmodelcanvas] , developed by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur, that was designed as a strategic tool to help teams to conceptualize and document potential business models. According to Wikipedia, it "is a hands-on tool that aims to foster understanding, discussion, creativity, and analysis." (Wikipedia contributors, n.d., Business Model Canvas). On the other hand, and likely due to the merits of the tool such as its visual representation [^footnote_businessmodelcanvas_visual], entrepreneurs run the risk of using it promote advancement, as in it grants status. I ended up idealizing an article about an extremme case of using the *Canvas* to promote; when I was driving a car and my partner told me that her colleague had sent an image of a *Canvas* through the phone messaging application. At that moment, a wave of adrenaline accelerated my blood which materialized the title of the article as "Never send a canvas to your investor," which is a simple idea that highlights a phenomenon which, at times, entrepreneurs get excited with the *Canvas* even to a point of missing its constructive potential, which is to learn and to iterate ideas. Thus, they often misuse as in promoting, presenting, not only due to the merits of the coherent storytelling but also as a result of the urge towards progressing. To be fair, perhaps whoever sent that *Canvas* was teasing her, inviting, to change the canvas, therefore to learn. As a side note, on the day when I got that article published in an online publication, the editor which approved and happened to be the CEO of the publication, left a note "Oops, I just did!" 

[^footnote_businessmodelcanvas]: The *Business Model Canvas*, developed by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur, is a strategic management template used for developing new business models and documenting existing ones. It consists of nine building blocks that together suggests that a coherent story must be completed, key elements of a business model. These building blocks include customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure. It's important to note that the primary purpose of the Business Model Canvas is not to serve as a tool for presenting a business or convincing stakeholders after the canvas is completed. Rather, it is a framework for understanding and designing business models. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas.

[^footnote_businessmodelcanvas_visual]: The arrangement by the nine blocks, provided by the company named Strategyzer AG, is available as a visual template, that welcome teams to iterate by sticking notes, like "post-it" notes if the canvas is printed, or using digital systems.

Therefore, the case of the *Canvas* with its simplicity of a structure that supports the building of a coherent story for a business model; supports storytelling. And although that support is first meant to allow a wider view, such as to set the team to do the homework and test different hypothesis, the very homework of filling out the spaces is what adds value and makes the coherent story to be perceived as promising. This is when filling the *Canvas* forms a picture, like a photo, likely to set the team to overvalue in alignment with the saying that a picture is worth a thousand words. 

As an illustration, consider the situation I had found of a founder that had anchored his team - a situation that I had observed  when I was an observer in a three-day *Business Canvas* workshop given at a local accelerator in Brazil. The professor had asked the participants to document their business ideas with the Canvas. In the next day, asked them to modify their canvases. They were six teams and had a limited amount of time to do the exercise. The idea given by the professor seemed smooth; as he provoked the teams to create a variation of their canvases - by forcing a limitation, which aligns with strategies used in creativity exercises where new ideas can be discovered by forcing certain limits, adding or subtracting features. As a side note, and context for how excited I was to see what would happen next, I had once joined a delightful course on creativity where all the participants had to come up with a restaurant. Our professor asked all of us to fill the blackboard and throw many ideas of things which a restaurant has such as: money, tables, plates, waiters, and all. Right after, he had given us a time limitation, of fifteen minutes, to the task to come up with an unique restaurant. But to help us, he had taken some key things from each team's restaurant, such as "team A, you can't use money. Team B, you can't have lights. Team C, you can't have tables. " At the end of the exercise, every single team had their mouths open, as we were amazed by the ideas we came up, and accordinly full of water.

In a matter of fifteen minutes we had created, and witnessed, amazing restaurant ideas. " 92489824-4820842-482048-4829482

--> 

But my excitement didn't last even five minutes back to the situation of the founders in a need to change their projects. Out of the six, only two teams had done substantial changes which seemed to accept the challenge happily. As I moved across the room, observing the inactivity, I took out my observer hat and asked one of the founders why they weren't trying. The CEO had replied that they wouldn't do because they had won a contest just the night before. I looked to the co-founder, a software developer, and the sad look in his face. I then moved away, slowly and moving backwards looking at them but not knowing what to say. 

What can be even scarier, which I like to see it as a reaction of the fusion, is that the "updated" canvas is still around, as if it gained an additional status; seen, again, as a photo that means a thousand words which by the way supresses other words such as of the discussion of what has happened. 

Therefore, on one hand, the *Canvas* stands a tool that doesn't give a winning situation, as in it has no date, no promise, no status, no judgement, in alignment with other *lean* methods where the iteration is meant for learning and not validation; and if any hint of validation is there, it may be so in alignment with the idea of validated learning, not validation to the business. On the other hand, when in the process, as discovery happens, and interaction happens, validation associated with values, emerge to affect the team's perceptions, and to set the team to move forward following a positive sense driven by an urgency that can become a villain.

#### Selective pressure 

Now the situation of the team that lived through anchoring sounds yet quite arbitrary, as it has to do with events, or incidents, which had triggered the team to commit into a direction as in "we are certain we are doing good". But if we move on, in a search to more significant forces, such a not coming from incidents, we should go back to the situation of startups, a general purpose that they are all for that - growth. With this setting, and the urge to move forward, teams will, on one hand and as considered, run the processes with lean methods to reduce subjectiveness, while, on the other hand, get into affairs with the roles who seem to keepers of the growth gates. These are the affairs with mentors, judges of accelerator systems, investors, if not themselves wearing that sort of hat. In other words, right after they go out of the building to get the data, as they come back to the room where the conversations about purpose are supposed to happen, they do find these roles, expecting and ready, to judge with values that were not priorly known but which nevertheless sets them to follow these voices and moreover to shut down conversations about purpose. 

Therefore, and even if perfection is never real and recognized and avoided as a good thing, some nuanced realization of scoring, or being perfect, being appropriate, being fit, are brought under the eyes of this outstanding judge, like an investor; which is waiting to check, to select, to give a go no go, under the pressure to grow. It's then a possibility that founders presenting to their eyes, such as their own eyes wearing the hat of gatekeepers of growth, will come accross these shining moments which may even produce shiny eyes; 

The truth in the space is that this support by these entities, the presence, also creates a selective pressure, which happens to be in many forms like when money runs out, co-founders disagree in values or vision, matching expectations with an outstanding possibility of investment, the reality that what is being done does not show any traction, and more. In other words, it's the voice from the pipeline that can affirm. If it works, move forward; if it fails, give up. There's no time to do lean as it should be done, not at all with a wider view about purpose. 

To illustrate growth forces, consider the perspective given by Howard Hartenbaum, in "Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital," (Stanford, 2013) where he had recognized that some teams are "precedents driven" in the sense of an alighment with the 10000-hour rule [^footnote_10000hour_rule] and likely with a deeper understanding of the underlying problem even at a philosophical level [^footnote_reid_phisolophy]. But one thing is to consider the team's involvement at that level of depth; but another is the very observation that top-tier venture capital firms are not only aware but actually quite involved in doing their homework, such as research about the potencial changes that are happening to the world. In other words, it has to do with the jobs of their partners, the homework of identifying risks and opportunities for investment which depends on using their minds and all the resources they can to advance their understanding about potential transformations. To illustrate how real is this, consider the situation depicted by Brad Stone in his 2017 book, "The Upstarts: How Uber, Airbnb, and the Killer Companies of the New Silicon Valley Are Changing the World," when Sequoia [^footnote_sequoia_capital] wanted to invest in a ride sharing business in the east of United States which didn't work because the CEO had refused to stay away from yellow cabs which was a concern and fear brought up by Sequoia. On the other hand, Sequoia moved on, and end up investing in a team from San Francisco, California, Uber, a team focusing on black cars, like limo service; although Sequoia were quite interested to know that the founders would be okay to scale towards yellow cabs when the moment was right.

In conclusion, the illustration is a reminder that strong thesis about the future, and even the inclination of bigger bets by investors, or customer's interest, can become supporting forces that be either mess up with values lean experiments or support.

<!-- check sb suggestion board case, reflect on that --> 

Since awareness is key to any process, and founders generally suffer from being enamored with the process, or living the tension of the purpose as they are mad with the relationship, it becomes the founder’s responsibility first to recognize such syndrome - as we have considered - then furthermore, to find for ways to ensure that the process is running with quality.

But the problem with quality goes back to how to do know which criteria should be used so that the team can see from above these situations. In Steve Blank’s suggestion, founders should find a board of directors or an advisory board: The body responsible for an outside perspective therefore supporting the founder to get out from instant pressures, and compromising decisions. This idea also aligns with a viewpoint given by Michael Dearing about the need for founders to establish a role who can critique the strategy. To contextualize the situation, Reid Hoffman had indicated the phase of the startup as of having 5-15 people: 

> *"The reason I'm zooming in on board is that most of the companies I fund are that size, and I always put a board on, and I'm always on it. So, I think they serve a really good and valuable function, and if you're going to do without one of these things, you should just have a hypothesis or a shock absorber in its place to do that function."* Michael Dearing (Greylock, 2015, 1:00:15)

The key from the inclination of Michael is what he had referred as "shock absorber" which would support any "going out" activity where one is trying to be systematic - such as to bring data - into focusing in being genuine to the cause, such as the bold vision or the purpose, with a point of view that recognizes uncertainty and where learning will help you out in the long run.

This view may actual more serve a principle than to establish strictly what to do. First, because a person of an arbitrary board, like the wrong board, may likely harm. Which sets the problem as: How on earth would an early team find a good board, such as a special person, and more than that to be willing to join the boat. In other words, it's seems like the chicken and egg problem which sets the reality of teams likely into the try try, fail fail, and if you win some credentials, then one may appear for you; which in the context of our reflection is not enough so let us consider some ideas that a special board would bring:

### The critic is not a killer 

A lot of the trouble, like the situation of the solo writer, rises from a potential appearance of a critic that has a too strong voice, such as to say that all that you did is not good to the standards of the market; or that is too good to the standards, extremme situations. Now, as indicated by Julia Cameron, the supporter role is there to maintain the good work, not to lie and be nice. In the work setting, the supporter critic should be created on two levels, any data or criticism inside the work should be looked from another lenses of a higher order which may go along with the idea of tolerance for momentary injustice: 

> “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity. Stay strong and stay calm as a situation settles itself over time and the clouds around any period of change start to dissipate. “ (Scott Belsky, 2010, Making Ideas Happen)

This the evaluations of the exercise aren't to punish the doer and the strategy; which in other words align with keeping the discussion about purpose on top. This also aligns with the view from Michael that was also given when he was asked by Reid how teams can check their ideas: 

> *"One really good strategy is to allocate a chunk of time in the schedule for devil's advocacy. This tactic, which I learned indirectly from Michael Eisner at Disney, operates on the premise that every big, good idea will be subjected to a devil's advocate case. The idea is to assign, probably, the smartest person available the task of trying to destroy your idea. This person isn't considered out of bounds for attempting to dismantle your concept; it's their job. The technique involves asking someone to spend the next few days identifying everything wrong with an idea, and they have full permission to be as critical as necessary to challenge it. Having people in your life who can effectively play this role is extremely beneficial for a founder." - Michael Dearing (Greylock, 2015, 33:34)

Notice Michael's point that if "isn't considered out of bounds" then it is the case that the team is aware, and if the team is aware, the doer should not be punished, or even evaluated as a function of the destruction caused by the judge; which is other words is about securing safety and honest discussions. This is not much different from the amateur-writer situation that had to nurture its readers, because that very awareness will bring about the consciousness that their work shouldn't be mutilated, which should bring maturiry in the life of a writer, such a maturity to eventualy see all comments, such as involvement of editors, as destruction that doesn't destroy the process. 

### Purpose before the surprises 

A point that we have seen, of a problem, is when teams suddenly find themselves in front of surprises, like when they win a contest or they fail a judgement of an accelerator judge, or even a no from a investor. These situations show that another point for rigor is a must, that teams should get better in telling in advance what are the potential judgements and decisions from judgements, ahead of time and not in retrospect. In this direction, Michael has also offered another view to Reid Hoffman on how to check ideas: 

> *"Another technique I favor is conducting a pre-mortem. We acknowledge our failure in advance and speculate on what might have led to our downfall. By doing this openly and honestly, and identifying the potential fatal risks to our venture, we can then decide whether to proceed or not. If we choose to continue, it's crucial to develop safeguards for those identified risks."* - Michael Dearing (Greylock, 2015, 33:34)

The exercise sets the team to run outside the problems as they happen, like into meta-management. This will bring about values, purpose, and the like; thus awareness to the team. 

One case of a scenario of lack of pre planning and awareness for what is going on is the possibility of the lean processes is that the team enters in a sort of endless cycles - even so temporarily - which where they might deal with doing again better, trying to be more professional about the construction of the hypothesis, and the means of tests, and they might explore specific value propositions, or their attempt to understand customers, and they might be very influenced by the very network that they are interacting with, so in a way they this is a very part of lean but it might start to bother the team that something is wrong.

### Values and vision 

The other case situation is when the team feels a disconnection with a purpose, or vision or mission - to note that in the early stages these things are not clearly distinct but nevertheless the reason that they work might connect with - and they are not comfortable anymore because the very interactions of lean takes them in a sort of new direction and it might be difficult for them to change their primary premises, or established anchors with these values, that would otherwise set them back in a promising direction which they feel connected. 

The other case is when the team may find traction that takes them in the direction or they might pivote into a promising direction where there's traction but there's certainly a disconnect with a vision and values of the founders and then they have the dilemma which is to jump out of the boat or to actually continue to run which is certainly maybe the case where they are under pressure but nevertheless they don't know if they continue to run they could actually end up in a situation of frustrations or other value-based or mission or vision based dissonance; and therefore by this interaction they may end up being less feeling in love and by that running into the possibility of being executors of a cause for money and the dissonance or the comparison with the other opportunity for them would put them in a place to not be proud of execution and not feeling as somebody in that line that demands evolving and leadership. 

## Conclusion

The other side of interpretation has to do with the general usage of lean, it might be considered that it adds the critical eye, the eye of the critic, and establishes by doing so a sort of judgment exactly by its idea of validated learning which is tied with the needs for data to advance towards growth. Therefore, the challenges of putting in practice lean, when executing a startup, may give us a window of opportunity to reflect about value and risks of interacting with external environment, the environment that brings the very customers and on the side participants that supports growth, which see themselves as on the side of who offers. In other words, the struggle lies from the augumentation of voices. With that, the view in perspective, such as looking for purpose, has to do with the need to bring back the balanced view for a process where the voice - of the external world - chimes in. A key consideration, as discussed, is to be aware and conscious of the interaction that may happen, beforehand, and not in retrospect. To prepare the team, the doers, to the scenarios of data, such as criticism, to evaluate how they would behave. 

Another important point to make is of the need to honor the subject of this section as relevant and open. In other words, and alike to the need for executing lean consciously, awareness is needed this discussion open. There are many articles and materials and consultants and coaches supporting lean execution. Even leading practitioners which were involved in the very early developments of lean, and the science and art of doing lean, are quite involved in doing lean consciously; which becomes evident how important it is the subject of controlling or being controlled by the external interactions or the when to release control, by the perceptions of limited external interactions, or the needs to establish a perspective on top of any interactions are part of the very subject of lean and therefore it makes lean valid because the other option would be to not care at all and continue to do so without a window of opportunity for a reflection. In this context, I feel proud to go back in history, such as to navigate through Steve Blank's article written in 2013 - - and to get his humble view that tells more of his involvement and level of responsibility: 

> *"While some adherents claim that the lean process can make individual start-ups more successful, I believe that claim is too grandiose. Success is predicated on too many factors for one methodology to guarantee that any single start-up will be a winner. But on the basis of what I’ve seen at hundreds of start-ups, at programs that teach lean principles, and at established companies that practice them, I can make a more important claim: Using lean methods across a portfolio of start-ups will result in fewer failures than using traditional methods."* Steve Blank (HBR, 2013)

--> 

Therefore, it is also noticeable that these leading authors, Eric Ries and Steve Blank to name exemplary ones, were involved in the art and science of entrepreneurship from many angles. Consider that they were entrepreneurs themselves, investors themselves in the first place, highly interested in the viewpoints for what happens from the investor's views, and yet not careless of what happens in the life of founders, needless to say that this situation brings the rise of true managers, leading them to follow through, to think through. 

These folks do care about the movement, the holistic view, which put them in the good place to see how things are changing. To point an example, consider how new interpretations are needed in the face of a movement that is not static, such as the article of Steve Blank written in alignment with the work of the Jobs to be Done team of Tony Ulwick and his team, with the realization that lean processes, such as customer discovery, may be benefited from a perspective about what is the market, which also involves objective observations that using a demographic-based market might obfuscate the view of a team that may be trying to discover a good solution for a "market" that defined by needs [^footnote_steve_tony_jtbd].

[^footnote_steve_tony_jtbd]: In 2021, Steve Blank (2021), emphasizes the importance to establish a wider view for the market definition. He first warns that certain market definitions, such as where defining a market solely around products, demographics, or technologies, can lead to a recursive process of constant iteration, altering the original market definition and potentially invalidating identified customer needs. This can result in startups churning, pivoting, and failing. In addition, he recognizes the contribution of the Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) theory which not only supports teams with a broader perspective about a market but also offers an structured framework that supports the process of innovation.

 likely because they came upon lean discoveries by reflecting on the movements about the needs to transcend. In other words, they are in the loop of lean, not as watchers but listeners of feedback that they get throughout time and which adds to them new perspectives. The very book of Eric Ries points presents a point of view that indicates that the need from a degree of view from above where the purpose is to bring back the values - as he wrote "purpose"  of the team members which may bring about values and the vision of the business and the consciousness about the ability to judge as in judgment from outside as in alignment with purpose which is very useful in the front of the potential critic that of course chimes in. And, needless to say, that any viewpoint that comes above everything is a very possibility of influencing everything.
