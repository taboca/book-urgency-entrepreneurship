# Lean deficit disorder 

The lean movement has permeated in the entrepreneurial world, in the life of founders and even at large companies. It went along, with its origins two decades ago [^footnote_steveblank_origins_remark], following the needs for agility, or efficiency, in a world that needed to respond faster, more interactive, dynamic, and a world where the consumer is more involved in the innovation process where the ones living the challenges firsthand at closer to the process of creation of solutions [^footnote_ericvonhippel_democratizing_innovation]. A decade ago, Harvard Business Review and Steve Blank recognized that, although young, the movement titled "the lean start-up" were on par with various other trends [^footnote_steve_blank_agile_lean_trends] which reflected the emerging needs such as closer relationships with potential customers, openness to failure, willingness to change course, iterative learning, and more transparent accounting of the innovation process - all this to improve the old processes where elaborate pre-planning prevailed. Over time, in the last decade, the lean movement has garnered much more attention and contributed to greater efficiency in the process of innovation for the creation of products and services.

[^footnote_steveblank_origins_remark]: In *Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything,* in 2013, Steve Blank (2013) recognizes that lean startup were happening, among entrepreneurs and even recognized by large com,panies, but yet promising. He recounts the origins, and realization of his work, has happened and projected in a course at Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley in 2003, together with his book *The Four Steps to the Epiphany*. He also acknowledges the other key major developments that had supported the popularization of the wider lean movements, through the work of his students, especially the Business Model Generation written by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur, in 2010, and *The Lean Startup* by his other student Eric Ries written in 2011. 

[^footnote_steve_blank_agile_lean_trends]: In *Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything,* Steve Blank (2013) indicated how start-ups doing lean, lean start-ups, were practicing *agile development*; to make a point that the development which is iterative had alignment with the lean movement practices.

[^footnote_ericvonhippel_democratizing_innovation]: In *Democratizing Innovation,* MIT professor and author, Eric von Hippel, explores the phenomenon of User Innovation, a concept where users play an active role in the innovation process. Von Hippel argues that users, being close to their own needs and experiences, often innovate by modifying and improving products or services. This user-driven innovation blurs the traditional boundaries between consumer and producer, fostering a collaborative environment where users not only consume but also contribute to the development and improvement of products and services.

<!-- situation of lean, highlights the complication that lean solves --> 

Let's consider Lean Startup, which is a methodology where progress depends on the concept of validated learning [^footnote_leanstartup_validated_learning], becoming vital in an environment of extreme uncertainty. Lean movements have changed the standard of the traditional formula that involved writing a business plan [^footnote_steveblank_oldapproach], pitching to investors, assembling the team, launching the product, and finally sales. In other words, lean movements are present in the design phase of a startup or the work unit of large companies seeking to innovate their products or services. In other words, interaction with the external environment is intended to reduce risks and allow for larger investments, such as the justification of a more elaborate prototype. Therefore, it can be abstracted to be a process that seeks greater efficiency for the innovation process in contrast with long-term design and development, when done with static data such as hypotheses, assumptions, market research, etc., which can lead to a big surprise when launched to an audience where no one is interested. For this and other reasons, lean movements refer to the idea of less work, or less waste, with respect to resources since interaction with the external environment creates the opportunity for validated learning that reduces uncertainties that justify larger investments that are also expected by the situation of startups seeking growth. In other words, lean methodologies confer great powers since the data obtained through interactions justify investments of resources for new stages, even if the stage asks to return to the cycle again.

[^footnote_leanstartup_validated_learning]: Validated Learning is a core concept in Eric Ries's book *The Lean Startup* (Ries, 2011). It refers to a process where startups use empirical data gathered from real customers to validate their hypotheses about both the business and product. This approach emphasizes learning over mere intuition and guides startups in making decisions based on what customers actually want, thereby reducing market risks and avoiding the building of products that customers do not need

[^footnote_steveblank_oldapproach]: In the article's, *Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything,* Steve Blank (2013) contrasts the decades-old formula, where innovators - small or large - would start by focusing on the development of the business plan followed by investment to producize and sell; with the at the time modern methodology named "lean startup" that enabled teams to search for business models using iterations with the external environment, therefore reducing risks of higher bets, not to mention the alignment with that other innovation processes, such as open source and democratization of venture financing, which reveals the presence of users in the innovation processes.

<!-- complication of lean, for us here --> 

<!-- some of these seem to be pre-complications? --> 

The realization for our moment which asks greater responsibility comes from the realization of the power of these processes. This because implicit of the the startup situation is that things starts small, based on hypotheses, even if the data is fragmented or insignificant - that these data become intrinsically significant in the sense that it affects the team's perceptions, in general. In other words, the data have a strong presence, often either criticizing or applauding excessively, given that experiments are elaborated based on growth pressures and the need for searching values, or validation, or the voice of the market, which are significant elements for more investment. Additionally, it is important to contextualize that precisely because there is no market dependence, like serving conquered customers, and the team being small, agility is observable in that startups can rapidly change direction and allows for more failures to occur in the search for correct approaches, and even a high tolerance for errors to the point of becoming a value, or almost a pride for founders [^footnote_samaltman_blitzscaling_pivot_generation].

[^footnote_samaltman_blitzscaling_pivot_generation]: There are many obvious reasons to consolidate the general idea that startups are in a good position to move faster, in the sense of changing directions, as of course the initial situation starts with no market dependencies and the small team, the intentions to execute cheaper experiments, and the like. But the general idea of pivoting went further from the notion that entrepreneurs should embrace the possibility, towards a point that pivoting is promoted, as illustrated by Sam Altman's interview (Altman, 2015) which recognized that "Silicon Valley really gets the pivot thing wrong," to the point that teams brag about pivoting, which for him means bragging about failing which is different from the needed aspect of tolerance for failure.

But shouldn't agile processes provide more learning precisely because they are closer to the external environment? Yes, in theory. However, in practice, entrepreneurs execute agile activities with behaviors that could be interpreted as self-validation or self-criticism as they advance in execution. Thus, they breach a fundamental contract of the agile movement's proposal with the claim that they are doing lean while in reality they are not. Perhaps this issue can be seen as a syndrome stemming from low self-esteem; they become “perfectionists” when they want to accumulate success points and do not feel comfortable advancing with greater recognition of their problems, giving a chance to something that aligns better with objectives, values that involve accepting failures and criticisms along the way, and finding opportunities to continue learning.

This environment also raises possible questions stemming from the pressure of growth, such as why entrepreneurs do not invest time in research aimed at proving that their ideas can fail? Or, more broadly, might entrepreneurs be at risk of losing commitment to the potential of the business in terms of values and meaning? Or, are entrepreneurs committed to validating the nature of the process, the difficulties, and, for example, how the influence of their experiments, such as modeling, choice of experiments, and collected data, can alter the course of the process?

<!-- elaboration of key lines ahead? --> 

In the pursuit of a conscious understanding and interpretation of the use of lean processes, our first reflection focuses in the conditions where teams, under pressure, lose the holistic vision which is the vision of purpose, ending up diminishing the potential of the process as they might, to name an extremme case, over focus in the process or the data.

Our second reflection focuses on the team of an early-stage startup, or even a solo entrepreneur, and explores how a diverted attention is experienced when doing lean - which can lead to a loss of connection with that needed greater purpose. In other words, we will examine the tendency to become overly centered on the lean process, especially when it presents an opportunity to disregard subjective data that might not seem appropriate. This can lead to a kind of fusion where the criticized becomes the critic, where the process ends up over-criticizing, adhering to quantitative molds or selection processes, leading to strong decisions based on weak signals, which in turn impact the vision of purpose.

Finally, we conclude with some thoughts from thinkers of the lean movement and others who are committed to understanding the challenges of navigating interactions with the external world while simultaneously being within and outside of the data, with the aim of creating more conducive conditions for innovation in the market.

## The holistic view under pressure 

In 2014, Google hosted a debate between the creators of Lean Startup and Design Thinking entitled *Lean Startup Meets Design Thinking*. In this debate, author Eric Ries sets the stage and elaborates how many of these lean processes are well intended, on one hand: 

<!-- 

## reference

Google for Startups. (2014). Lean Startup Meets Design Thinking [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvFnHzU4_W8

--> 

> *"Grab the design silo, and they have read Tim’s book, and if they understand what a modern approach design looks like, you will see kind of design thinking that he mentioned. Grab marketing, you will see customer development. If you grab operations, you will see some dev ops.. You might find an organization where at every silo, things are very iterative, customer centric, and where people are really focused on learning."* - Eric Ries (2014, 11:14)

[^designthinking]: *Design Thinking* is a process aligned with other "lean" or "agile" methods but originated from the world of design and which is also applicable in a broader context to support teams to innovate. https://hbr.org/2008/06/design-thinking

While, on the other hand, coherence between deparments remains a major problem that prevents innovation from happening: 

> "*But then, zoom out and you will say “wow, this must be a really adaptable, learning oriented company, this is fantastic.” But actually, what you will see in a lot of companies, is, although there all this iteration learning happening at each individual silo, the actual work product that company produces, is passed binder to binder from each silo to the next, in a totally linear and old school waterfall style approach. “* - Eric Ries (2014, 11:14)

According to Eric, the leaders of these departments believe that if they could control the other departments, things would be much easier. In other words, the view from within silos gives them hope, or expectatins, that their specific agile effort is sufficient to ensure the overall success. However, the challenge from top-down is a must and lies in moving across these silos and checking the local purpose versus higher purposes. In other words, deals with the struggle of a choreography that seeks to create harmony accross working boxes: 

> *"Of course, everybody in all the silos are saying that, and, for modern managers that can be really challenging. So, for me, my aspiration for Lean Startup is not to have people adopt it as yet another silo approach, but rather to take these common elements, that are common to design thinking, and to agile, and to lean, and certain apply them at a system-wide, at the company level, so that we have a common framework for understanding what are the problems, a common approach for the process that we are going to use to solve those problems, and most importantly, we can speak the language of business to say “he are the concrete financial and business outcomes that we can achieve if we work in this way."* — - Eric Ries (2014, 11:14)

This concern with the unity, or lack thereof, among company departments can serve as a basis for exploring the problem faced by all levels - in large companies or smaller settings where entrepreneurs are dealing with agile processes. 

### The breakdown of the holistic view 

Imagine a professional that was allowed to make interviews and to bring data, thus was safe to operate in her own silo, like a mission which is good in the sense of "if you choose to accept this mission" with the benefits of operability. But as the mission unfolds, as the professional did her best, the data brings about a potential conclusion that could provoke the higher-order system. Therefore, as she submits the work to the higher-order, judges happen to bring about conflicting values. Now if this situation brings a tension, such as to provoke the current flow and the whole system in course, would then this employee be rewarded in this case? This brings about the complications that people are engaged in being someone and that being someone involves doing a good job and that doing a good job can be the very source of bring about chaos in the life of the doer such as living the pressures to please or not to please. 

As an illustration inspired by a startup setting, consider a chief designer that has recruited an *User Experience Designer* to conduct an experiment involving interviews with people. However, as the results were presented, the chief designer felt offended - she took the feedback as criticism to her own prior work. This situation raises a concern: should the hired designer avoid conducting some of the activities in order to prevent defensive reactions? The case illustrates the potential for conflict. In this story, the subordinate designer felt frustrated too, as her work would not be welcomed and considering that she had invested more time beyond the usual. This situation exposes frustrations as it pulls the participants to consider that their job positions could be jeopardized by the unconverings of a subordinate's well done work. Which, in other words, may mean a degree of lack of transparency about potential outcomes, or the interpretation of outcomes, and the general commitment with purpose from all parts. 

These are situations of a complex work setting with multiple people and where it is important to map the values that are influencing everyone's work. Consider the concern of Eric Ries: 

> *“It’s easy for us, to kind of get lost and forget what the purpose of our work everyday is. I think a lot of the waste in the modern work environment has to do with people that become disconnected from what is that purpose, what is the greater meaning of the work that we do.”* - Eric Ries (2014, 10:35)

The finding of learning experiments are valid but a lack of purpose happens as the team in the silo is not exposed to higher purposes and values affecting as actually the purpose for everyone involved is controlled by higher-order purposes such as how the organization measures and evaluates their work. In other words, if under a lack of general purpose that transcends the job done, the experiment and its learnings gain too much attention or it gains concrenetess to be subjectivelly judged from the point of view of the doer but objectivelly judged by the other current acting forces of the higher-order. In other words, the system reacts and it may do so brutally as the tension is exposed. To make things worse, this tension may be exposed not clearly and in the hallways, as opposed to be part of the discussion of the lean experiment acting in the current.  

## Entrepreneurial attention deficit 

After having considered the disconnect with purpose in the case of teams, it remains as a question of where the problem starts, such as if the complication happens in the young setup. Now, we if turn our attention to the entrepreneur, or the smaller team, it is clearly a context of startup discovery [^author-steveblankstartup] which is different from the large organization as obviously there are no silos, or departments, not even a product, a market or customers, and therefore apparently not conflicting values or purposes. 

[^author-steveblankstartup]: Steve Blank had considered the fundamental difference from a large company and a startup, emphasizing that a startup is an entity in the process of discovery, primarily working to validate its initial hypotheses in an uncertain environment. For more details, read *A Startup is Not a Smaller Version of a Large Company* from Steve Blank (2010).

But wait, we shouldn't assume that the early version does not come with a built-in inclination, that the embrionary startup setting does not carry the seed that may grow into a tree of complications as discussed. To develop further this consideration, we may start by recognizing that lean processes are welcomed by entrepreneurs as their need for rigor, such as the need for data, has ties with what differentiates them from the large corporation setting which is the heavy and stronger presence of subjective notions associated with vision, values, passions and the like.

Therefore, a team values and engages with lean by the very situation of having too many hypothesis, too many ideas, too strong vision, and even hallucinations [^footnote_steveblank_hallucinations]. Therefore, the possibility of investment in productizing, such as experimenting or prototypinng, sounds scary as it would sound like a bet, or too ambiguous, too subjective, which would result in a denial to maintaining a high value to the subjective interpretations, and conversely favor rigorous analysis. This inclination, when recognized, pushes entrepreneurs into overfocusing on the experiment in an attempt to make the data speaks louder, under the good intentions of driving by looking in the mirror. Now all of this may not even sound too bad, exactly, but what the alarm lies in the possibility that the presence of the experiment, which had origins to counterbalance subjectiveness, ends up pushing founders into the very possibility of a denial for the subjective interpretation that could maintain the sense of purpose, that could bring back values, priciples, and purpose; this pushing the team to not be aware of the needed level of responsibility.

[^footnote_steveblank_hallucinations]: Steve Blank illustrates that the visions of founders are visions, are dreams, not disconnected from the situation of "a calling". The metaphor that founders hallucinate given by Steve makes that point. 

An illustration of the problem was brought through the interview that Rohan Workman conducted with Steve Blank, as he asked whether the popularization of lean movements reveals entrepreneurs who claim to do lean but actually don't. Steve Blank had not only acknowledged the situation as a of disorder that affects founders and had illustrated an example of an extremme situation: 

> *"A founder goes out of the building, hears something from a customer. Comes back to his poor company and announces — we need to pivot! we need to pivot! and we need to pivot again!"* Steve Blank (MAP14, 2014, 24m10s)

For Steve, the idea of "pivoting" is used by founders as an excuse for an attention deficit that affects founders. From this observation, he created the "Rule of 72 Hours" to help entrepreneurs reflect on the situation, whicih consisted of “Keeping your mouth shut, from when you think you got an insight to when you are allowed to announce the word pivot, inside your company.” (MAP14, 2014, 24m10s)

The point of "The Rule of 72 Hours" works like a joke and reminder and it is intended to assist entrepreneurs in remembering that they are subject to this attention deficit which diverts them from their major goal. They might become victium of one or another activity of the agile process and lose focus about the broader perspective, the objective, or the purpose. When they do so, their experiments cease to be scientific in the sense of anyone doing a small experiment would need to recognize the flaws and the perspective that all that was done happened under limited conditions. As an example of the broader perspective, one would be interested in preventing the immediatism with the realization that “one data point is not enough.” 

But in reality, in the field, it's not easy. Consider, for example, a situation following of a team agenda where the need to succeed, or progress, is outstanding, and the team's prior situation had involved a lot of involvement being in the room, such as focusing on idealizations, hypothesis, and more. Therefore, in this case, the very movement of going out, or as Steve would say "get out from the building" is quite fascinating, idealistically, because the value of acessing data from the real world sounds as good reasons in contrast with the prior movement of using resources in the building which would sound like navigating blindly. In other words, the complication is that while the CEO arrives announcing the "let's pivot," she might not get the "wait for 72 hours" and instead may be applauded by the whole team as they where the ones crying out for that duty in the first place.  

Thus, tests are conducted with a critical tone that selects or validates, pressured by a connection with numbers or projections of a final product, pressures of the growth order, pressures to execute with more rigor, maturity, you name it. In this process, teams might lose the connection with the greater purpose that brought them together in the first place. Or they may respond to the numbers and stumble upon product variations, or pivot to other directions almost arbitrarily, or become demotivated by the data from their experiments, which were very significant in terms of numbers, among other situations. In this regard, the realization of one data point is too big, too strong, is actually vital - and likely fatal too - as the data point does not come isolated from the ongoing and outstanding needs and pressures.  

Or to map the forces in the illustration, since we are not in the situation, and safely can freely reflect and idealize scenarions, we shall consider the potential latent need, or pain, of the team asking for the founder to get out given that the team had spent a lot idealizing; the inclination of a founder to get the data because they were doing too much subjective analysis, which may involve a potential denial and allowance of subjective analysis, which could also lead to looking at the not enough data as in enough data and better than subjectiveness to a point of blinding the team from context, from having a wider perspective, such as to see that the experiment data could be a total flaw, ignore the wider context that holds the team together, the wider purpose, nuanced interpretations, analysis without pressure, and more. 

### Fusion with the critic  

Furthermore, this confrontation of interests may also appear in any stages such as the situation of a small team or even at the individual level, thus it may give us to opportunity to see it as a fusion with multiple roles, which can be the minimal unit of the tension. A reflection about the early company struggle, the apparent sign of trouble, can be identified by the indicated conflict that a founder may have found as they fight with the data the the realization of "they just don't get it" (MAP14, 2014) when they are focusing on the vision; and alltogether the eventual realization of "they might be right" which shows that they had defined a responsibility to the duty of lean in the first place. This situation shows how the lean experiment can be fragile in as things are not clear, in front of a perception of clear vision. But, on the other hand, quite strong, if the responsibility of doing lean acts as a stronger criticism. The reality is that “one data point is not enough” as indicated by Steve, is strong enough, tough, to cause change of path in a development in both situations - either trusting too much lean data or the full denial. 

Let us consider how to tame the critic, therefore to allow room for external interactions where data chimes in, and where the critical analysis is deferred to later, with a more conscious and friendly secondary phase, such as of what a conscious board would do. 

The illustration of the problem of the fusion with the critic, consider a sitation of a life of an aspiring writer that needs feedback as writting happens. As she engages with others seeking feedback, she also engages in overlistening to a point of internalizing the voice fo the critic, even to a point of being blocked by the very criticism. This complex situation gains an enlighted viewpoint with the wisdom of Julia Cameron given by The Right to Write - as she points a case of Terrence, a writer that became blocked by interacting with a professional editor: 

> *"Although we seldom think of it this way, a writer's block is often very healthy self-protective on the part of our inner creator to a dangerous threat. Terrence's inner writer refused to have his work misread and mutilated. " Julia Cameron (1998, p.180)

<!-- 

## reference

Cameron, J. (1998). The Right to Write. TarcherPerigee.

--> 

She points that there are cases that when editors are out of the loop - fired - the work had continued to work, the writing continued to happen. But it turns out that the criticism, such as that negative criticism that mutilates the work, is really tied to how one internalizes what was told, like voice of the market. In other words, when it happens like as if the data is too strong, or too brutal, it might happen under a latent potential for criticism which is outstanding in the first place by the situation, like expectations, of the doer. Therefore, is not unlikely that the incident is so brutal that one can't even reflect about what has happened, such as being aware that what was shown wasn't ready to be exposed to that particular kind of critisicm, such as that the doer might have engaged with anyone under the assumption that the criticism would advance smoothly, such as that one had invited a quite arbitrary reviewer, such as one that is also not conscious, or even aware, that the text is under construction may actually needed to be seen in perspective. In other words, the writer-doer wasn't conscious of that in the first place. This complexity requires, as recommended by Julia Cameron, that a writer to engage in activities such as of nurturing readers, thus to be free from the critic that is unconscious, and to get involved with a critic like a friendly critic: 

> *"It is very important that we keep a few nurturing readers as friends to our work quite apart from whatever is going on in our publishing life. We need people who are happy to hear a poem or an essay for its own sake and not as career maneuaveurs. The part of us that writes must be allowed to write freely and not always with an eye to the market. An eye to the market is part of the writing life, but if it is too large a part, it shuts down invention and leads to the blockage of many valuable avenues of exploration which are not - at first blush - commercial."* Julia Cameron (1998, p.181)

The startup version of that support can be created, a conscious point of view that the interaction with lean establishes the voice of the market, that lean data being exposed needs to be exposed under a perspective, such as a perspective that supports that what is being taken does not demand actions to be immediately taken. The analysis of what to do, therefore, needs a point of view of support, which takes in consideration the values, the vision, a wider view, purpose. In other words, exactly because one data point is not enough, one data point can't either be too strong to impact positively or negatively. Being one or a lot of data points, this supporting role must exist which is never unaware of the team values, team vision, team beliefs, and team's purpose. 

### Anchoring 

Although we have reflected about the need to be aware about purpose, to establish the clear conversation about the team's purpose, it does not mean that purpose is not acting anyway, as we have considered, as a force. For the sake of identifying the force that may affect results of lean experiments, we shall consideer the team, anchoring, as an element that may happen due to purpose, or values, and can affect interpretations. 

Let's start by talking about the "Business Model Canvas," the popular lean tool developed by Alexander Osterwalder that was designed for learning about potential business models, although entrepreneurs run the risk of using it promote advancement, as if it means status, like credits. I ended up idealizing an article, mainly the title of it, as "never send a canvas to your investor," while driving car when my partner seating next to me said that her colleague had sent an image of a *Canvas* via WhatsApp. At that moment, a wave of adrenaline surged through my body, mainly materialized as the title to the article, which is a simple idea but highlights a phenomenon that at times, entrepreneurs are not using the *Canvas* to its constructive potential, to learn, to iterate ideas, and often simply fall victim to its destructive potential where they misuse as in promoting, presenting, likely as a result of their urge towards progressing. To be fair, perhaps whoever sent that Canvas was just inviting her to change that Canvas, therefore to learn. As a side note, on the day when I got that article published on a publication, the CEO had replied to me saying "I just did," likely confirming our urge to use the canvas to tell the story that seems coherent. And it does, doesn't it? As one shall be very happy to see how the *Canvas* has that built-in value - coherence by its nine building blocks [^footnote_businessmodelcanvas].

[^footnote_businessmodelcanvas]: The Business Model Canvas, developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is a strategic management template used for developing new business models and documenting existing ones. It consists of nine building blocks that together provide a coherent story of a business's key elements. These building blocks include customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure. It's important to note that the primary purpose of the Business Model Canvas is not to serve as a tool for presenting a business or convincing stakeholders after the canvas is completed. Rather, it is a framework for understanding and designing business models.

And although that support is first meant to allow a wider view, such as to set the team to do their homework in a number of areas, the very homework feeding back the Canvas supports coherence again, thus adds value, or fidelity to the *Canvas* and then it becomes a picture, or a photo, likely with the benefits and risks of the knowing that a picture is worth a thousand words. 

A stronger, or more colored illustration of a founder driven by the *Canvas* has happened when I was in a role of a observer in a three-day Business Canvas workshop given at a local accelerator in Brazil. The professor had asked the participants to modify their Canvas projects. They were six teams and had a limited amount of time to do the exercise. The idea given by the professor seemed nice, as it provoked the teams to create a variation of their *Canvas* by setting a provocation, such as forcing a limitation, which aligns with strategies used by creativity exercises where new ideas can be discovered by forcing certain limits, adding or subtracting features. As a side note and context for how excited I was to see what next, I had once joined a delightful course on creativity where all the participants had to come up with a restaurant. Our professor asked all of us to feed the blackboard in a brainstorming with all that is known that a restaurant has such as: money, tables, plates, waiters, and all. Right after, he had given us fifteen minutes and the task to create an unique restaurant. But to help us, he had taken some key features for each team, such as "team A, you can't use money." At the end of the exercise every single team had created an amazing restaurant idea.

But my excitement didn't last even five minutes in this episode where founders needed to change their projects. From the six teams, only two had accepted to do anything. As I moved across the room, observing the inactivity of teams, I broke the observer rule and asked one of the founders why they weren't trying. The CEO had replied that they wouldn't do because they had won a contest or some other confirmation that they were right, just the night before. I looked to the co-founder, a software developer. He had a sad look in his face. I literally moved away, slowly and moving backwards looking at them and not knowing what to say. They were anchored by that last night. 

The *Canvas*, as a process, doesn't want to give you a winning *Canvas*. It has no date, no promise, like any *lean* process which the central idea is learning, not validation. And if any hint of validation is there, it may be so in alignment with the idea of validated learning, not validation to the business. Steve Blank, in Customer Development (Four Steps to the Epiphany), emphasizes the search part of the process as one that returns to the beginning, designed to go backward, like many other lean processes. But, again and again, entrepreneurs want to move forward. The positive sense of urgency that becomes a villain. And in this sense, a fundamental point of the whole story is worth mentioning - that the act of entrepreneurship is both science and art that must be led by those who are willing, prepared, and have a strong connection with the idea, with the merit.

### Selective pressure 

While, on one hand, Canvas and other lean processes indicate the cycle that should be repeated, on the other hand, the entrepreneur, or teams responsible for the discovery process, are setting dates and creating criteria with a clear objective: to move forward. The very complexity for teams doing these processes is that the room for purpose can also be filled with the how the gatekeepers of growth judge, if not themselves. Therefore and even if perfection is never real and recognized and avoided as a good thing, some nuanced realization of scoring, or being perfect, may create a risk such as when the discoveries from the execution are brought under the eyes of the outstanding judge, like an investor, which is waiting to check, to select, to give a go no go, under the pressure to grow. It's in a way unavoidable that founders looking into their eyes, or their own eyes, will come accross these shining moments which may even produce shiny eyes. 

The truth in the space is that this support, or selected pressure, happens from many angles, like due to when money and resources run out, co-founders disagree, the next round of investment never happens, or simply the product doesn't sell, and more. In other words, it's the voice from the pipeline ahead that can affirm. If it works, move forward; if it fails, give up. There's no time to do Lean as it should be done, not at all with a wider view about purpose. 

To illustrate growth forces, consider the perspective given by Howard Hartenbaum, in "Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital," (Stanford, 2013) where he had recognized that some teams are "precedents driven" in the sense of an alighment with the 10000-hour rule [^footnote_10000hour_rule] and likely with a deeper understanding of the underlying problem even at a philosophical level [^footnote_reid_phisolophy]. But one thing is to consider the team's involvement at that level of depth; but another is the very observation that top-tier venture capital firms are not only aware but actually quite involved in doing their homework, such as research about the potencial changes that are happening to the world. In other words, it has to do with the jobs of their partners, the homework of identifying risks and opportunities for investment which depends on using their minds and all the resources they can to advance their understanding about potential transformations. To illustrate how real is this, consider the situation depicted by Brad Stone in his 2017 book, "The Upstarts: How Uber, Airbnb, and the Killer Companies of the New Silicon Valley Are Changing the World," when Sequoia [^footnote_sequoia_capital] wanted to invest in a ride sharing business in the east of United States which didn't work because the CEO had refused to stay away from yellow cabs which was a concern and fear brought up by Sequoia. On the other hand, Sequoia moved on, and end up investing in a team from San Francisco, California, Uber, a team focusing on black cars, like limo service; although Sequoia were quite interested to know that the founders would be okay to scale towards yellow cabs when the moment was right.

In conclusion, the illustration is a reminder that strong thesis about the future, and even the inclination of bigger bets by investors, or customer's interest, can become supporting forces that be either mess up with values lean experiments or support.

Since awareness is key to any process, and founders generally suffer from being enamored with the process, it becomes the founder’s responsibility first to recognize such syndrome; then second, to find for ways to ensure the process is running with quality.

But the problem with quality is always in knowing which criteria to use for these situations that can be really adverse. In Steve Blank’s suggestion, founders should find a board of directors or an advisory board: The body responsible for from an outside perspective therefore supporting the founder to get out from instant pressures, and compromising decisions.

The key to executing the process is to do it first without holding the agenda for the success (for the business or the idea.) Success, for the process, is most likely the case of learning new information (good or bad.) When going out, or trying to be systematic about the data you get, you need to be genuine to the cause (the bold vision) but at the same time recognize uncertainty and that learning will help you out in the long run.

And the same may also apply to what the founder would get as failure. In Scott Belsky’s Making Ideas Happen, a reading about failure does not have to be a dead end:

> “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity. Stay strong and stay calm as a situation settles itself over time and the clouds around any period of change start to dissipate. “ (Scott Belsky, 2010, Making Ideas Happen)

### Release of control and access to move on 

No mundo onde vários colaboradores estão executando suas ações debaixo de grande pressão (por exemplo resultante de indicadores chave, agenda, metas e ainda levando em consideração as agendas e tendências específicas das especialidades dos colaboradores) acontece que as vezes grupos se encontram diante de opções divergentes.

* Marcio colocou a história que ele viveu quando fez um contrato para o projeto SongBird, da Califórnia. O pessoal do Songbird contratou ele para fazer um tema de design para o aplicativo de música. O Marcio tentou seguir algumas especificações mas no final do dia acabou fazendo um sistema para criar vários temas coloridos. No final do mês o SongBirg novo foi lançado com um outro tema, não o do Márcio; foi quando o Márcio descobriu que haviam dois contratos sendo executados em paralelo.

* Fabrício indicou sobre a situação onde pode-se optar por caminhos A ou B, mas ao mesmo tempo existe o problema da falta de tempo ou de recursos limitados.

* Marcio apontou o caso do Andy Groove em High Output Management, que aponta que reuniões devem procurar permitir que as melhores ideias possam surgir, ou seja, não é importante que exista um consenso na questão das ideias, mas sim na parte da decisão para execução. Um time deve procurar melhores ideias, e mesmo que uma pessoa seja favorecida, o outro (ideia oposta) deve estar colaborando depois da decisão do todo. Essa ideia em geral deve ser algo comprado (buy-in) pelos colaboradores antes dos processos criativos, ou seja, preparando eles para a situação de aprendizado e para a posterior execução.






* Put MD case of Disney 

Em geral, poucos empreendedores têm coragem para investir o tempo nesse tipo de esforço. Outros fazem pior ao se convencerem que a execução das atividades  ágeis por si só significa sucesso. E assim eles dizem “Ah, eu fiz o processo do *canvas*” ou “Estou fazendo o processo correto das entrevistas qualitativas” e passam a avançar em um modo acelerado que os cega de reconhecer que deveriam aprender e retroceder. Executar as metodologias ágeis é bom, mas não vale nada quando questões fundamentais não são respeitadas. Pior ainda: é quando o processo é usado errado de forma consciente e deliberada para criar uma falsa ideia, como quem usa os dados em uma apresentação para provar um ponto, mas sabe que é falso. Nessa linha, existem empreendedores de vários tipos: inocentes, encantados, e os que se enganam. Mas independente do perfil, uma coisa é certa — o negócio não sobrevive pois no final é o negócio que dita como serão as coisas.

Tirar “nota 10” em uma ou outra tarefa não implica que o empreendimento irá ganhar o jogo na partida final. Muitas vezes, lá na frente, quando chegam as grandes crises, empreendedores percebem que estavam ignorando os sinais — que os sinais estavam por toda parte mas eles não queriam enxergar. Então, o problema é similar, tanto para empreendedores como para empresas — líderes se perdem na coreografia dos processos. Nas empresas, como sugerido por Eric Ries{id: author-eric-ries-200-600-h}, a dificuldade está em harmonizar o resultado dos trabalhos dos silos funcionais ágeis. No contexto dos empreendedores, a dificuldade está em olhar por fora os “silos” da execução de atividades ágeis. ! Na fase de descoberta da startup, eles precisam ser tornar melhores generalistas; devem sobrevoar acima das suas ideias, das suas próprias paixões, dos seus produtos e até acima do mercado. Nesse sentido, devem se tornar advogados múltiplos, que defendem suas ideias mas igualmente defendem o ambiente externo que pode estar contra as suas ideias. Esse ponto de vista só tem uma intenção — mais chances para o negócio.






### Possibilities 



#### Considerations of endless cycles 

One case in situation are a scenario of possibility of the lean processes is that the team enters in a sort of endless cycles - even so temporarily - which where they might deal with doing again better, trying to be more professional about the construction of the hypothesis, and the means of tests, and they might explore specific value propositions, or their attempt to understand customers, and they might be very influenced by the very network that they are interacting with, so in a way they this is a very part of lean but it might start to bother the team that something is wrong.

#### Traces of disconnection with purpose such as mission 

The other case situation is when the team feels a disconnection with a purpose, or vision or mission - to note that in the early stages these things are not clearly distinct but nevertheless the reason that they work might connect with - and they are not comfortable anymore because the very interactions of lean takes them in a sort of new direction and it might be difficult for them to change their primary premises, or established anchors with these values, that would otherwise set them back in a promising direction which they feel connected. 

The other case is when the team may find traction that takes them in the direction or they might pivote into a promising direction where there's traction but there's certainly a disconnect with a vision and values of the founders and then they have the dilemma which is to jump out of the boat or to actually continue to run which is certainly maybe the case where they are under pressure but nevertheless they don't know if they continue to run they could actually end up in a situation of frustrations or other value-based or mission or vision based dissonance; and therefore by this interaction they may end up being less feeling in love and by that running into the possibility of being executors of a cause for money and the dissonance or the comparison with the other opportunity for them would put them in a place to not be proud of execution and not feeling as somebody in that line that demands evolving and leadership. 

(The situation of an the extremmes of Steve Blank are ) 

#### Traction in alignment with purpose 

And there's certainly the case where the interactions and the effort that the team has put in place brought data that is relevant or it means traction in the very direction in alignment with the vision they have and that at least gives them the opportunity to move on at least to another more complex configuration, towards growth, which naturally will bring ahead potential challenges related to the complexitity of the need to grow in a bigger market which they could be not a initially aware, or natural demands growth in other directions by the growth needs either driven by company values, or growth pressures driven by investors, or even the natural demands of the consumers which more and more participates, and continue to engage with evolving needs. 


## Conclusion

The other side of interpretation has to do with the general usage of lean, it might be considered that it adds the critical eye, the eye of the critic, and establishes by doing so a sort of judgment exactly by its idea of validated learning which is tied with the needs for data to advance towards growth. Therefore, the challenges of putting in practice lean, when executing a startup, may give us a window of opportunity to reflect about value and risks of interacting with external environment, the environment that brings the very customers and on the side participants that supports growth, which see themselves as on the side of who offers. In other words, the struggle lies from the augumentation of voices. With that, the view in perspective, such as looking for purpose, has to do with the need to bring back the balanced view for a process where the voice - of the external world - chimes in. A key consideration, as discussed, is to be aware and conscious of the interaction that may happen, beforehand, and not in retrospect. To prepare the team, the doers, to the scenarios of data, such as criticism, to evaluate how they would behave. 

Another important point to make is of the need to honor the subject of this section as relevant and open. In other words, and alike to the need for executing lean consciously, awareness is needed this discussion open. There are many articles and materials and consultants and coaches supporting lean execution. Even leading practitioners which were involved in the very early developments of lean, and the science and art of doing lean, are quite involved in doing lean consciously; which becomes evident how important it is the subject of controlling or being controlled by the external interactions or the when to release control, by the perceptions of limited external interactions, or the needs to establish a perspective on top of any interactions are part of the very subject of lean and therefore it makes lean valid because the other option would be to not care at all and continue to do so without a window of opportunity for a reflection. In this context, I feel proud to go back in history, such as to navigate through Steve Blank's article written in 2013 - - and to get his humble view that tells more of his involvement and level of responsibility: 

> *"While some adherents claim that the lean process can make individual start-ups more successful, I believe that claim is too grandiose. Success is predicated on too many factors for one methodology to guarantee that any single start-up will be a winner. But on the basis of what I’ve seen at hundreds of start-ups, at programs that teach lean principles, and at established companies that practice them, I can make a more important claim: Using lean methods across a portfolio of start-ups will result in fewer failures than using traditional methods."* Steve Blank (HBR, 2013)

Therefore, it is also noticeable that these leading authors, Eric Ries and Steve Blank to name exemplary ones, were involved in the art and science of entrepreneurship from many angles. Consider that they were entrepreneurs themselves, investors themselves in the first place, highly interested in the viewpoints for what happens from the investor's views, and yet not careless of what happens in the life of founders, needless to say that this situation brings the rise of true managers, leading them to follow through, to think through. 

These folks do care about the movement, the holistic view, which put them in the good place to see how things are changing. To point an example, consider how new interpretations are needed in the face of a movement that is not static, such as the article of Steve Blank written in alignment with the work of the Jobs to be Done team of Tony Ulwick and his team, with the realization that lean processes, such as customer discovery, may be benefited from a perspective about what is the market, which also involves objective observations that using a demographic-based market might obfuscate the view of a team that may be trying to discover a good solution for a "market" that defined by needs [^footnote_steve_tony_jtbd].

[^footnote_steve_tony_jtbd]: In 2021, Steve Blank (2021), emphasizes the importance to establish a wider view for the market definition. He first warns that certain market definitions, such as where defining a market solely around products, demographics, or technologies, can lead to a recursive process of constant iteration, altering the original market definition and potentially invalidating identified customer needs. This can result in startups churning, pivoting, and failing. In addition, he recognizes the contribution of the Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) theory which not only supports teams with a broader perspective about a market but also offers an structured framework that supports the process of innovation.

 likely because they came upon lean discoveries by reflecting on the movements about the needs to transcend. In other words, they are in the loop of lean, not as watchers but listeners of feedback that they get throughout time and which adds to them new perspectives. The very book of Eric Ries points presents a point of view that indicates that the need from a degree of view from above where the purpose is to bring back the values - as he wrote "purpose"  of the team members which may bring about values and the vision of the business and the consciousness about the ability to judge as in judgment from outside as in alignment with purpose which is very useful in the front of the potential critic that of course chimes in. And, needless to say, that any viewpoint that comes above everything is a very possibility of influencing everything.
