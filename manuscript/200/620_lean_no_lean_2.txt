MAP14 public forum, 2014, Australia – Rohan Workman interviewed Steve Blank and asked about challenge of doing lean versus talking about lean (in the context of an entrepreneur or founder that is yet responsible for a start-up at the discovery phase.)

[Rohan Workman asks Steve Blank to elaborate about the problem of Talking about Learn, versus actually Doing Lean (23m50s)](https://youtu.be/UFx2CQUTpYo?t=1432)

Steve Blank acknowledges the problem as a of disorder that affects founders as they get enamored with the process. Let’s dig a bit more into the case and reflect about advices from Steve and others great minds.

##### Pivot as an excuse to the entrepreneur’s attention deficit

As indicated by Steve Blank, entrepreneurs may react too quick as they encounter data from the activities from what they understand is the process.

Throughout his experience, an extreme case is the situation when the founder goes out, listens to customers, and back to the office they go like “We need to pivot, we need to pivot, and we need to pivot again.” To prompt us to reflect, Steve’s 72 hour rule is a joke-style metaphor that serves well to help founders and teams to first understand the situation:

> “Keeping your mouth shut, from when you think you got an insight to when you are allowed to announce the word pivot, inside your company” (Steve Blank @ MAP14, 2014, [24m34s](https://youtu.be/UFx2CQUTpYo?t=24m32s))

The situation depicted clearly shows that the agenda, or the need to succeed, gets in the way of the founder and the team. The reality is that “one data point is not enough” says Steve.

For some entrepreneurs, that never left the room, perhaps going out can be fascinating and too nice, or romantic. That maybe is simply the truth of the situation: Talking with someone can be fascinating in contrast with idealizing things in front of a digital screen.

##### Focus in the learning

The key to executing the process is to do it first without holding the agenda for the success (for the business or the idea.) Success, for the process, is most likely the case of learning new information (good or bad.) When going out, or trying to be systematic about the data you get, you need to be genuine to the cause (the bold vision) but at the same time recognize uncertainty and that learning will help you out in the long run.

And the same may also apply to what the founder would get as failure. In Scott Belsky’s Making Ideas Happen, a reading about failure does not have to be a dead end:

> “The best practice here is to develop a tolerance for momentary injustice an periods of ambiguity. Stay strong and stay calm as a situation settles itself over time and the clouds around any period of change start to dissipate. “ (Scott Belsky, 2010, Making Ideas Happen)

#### Expand the horizon of awareness

Since awareness is key to any process, and founders generally suffer from being enamored with the process, it becomes the founder’s responsibility first to recognize such syndrome; then second, to find for ways to ensure the process is running with quality.

But the problem with quality is always in knowing which criteria to use for these situations that can be really adverse. In Steve Blank’s suggestion, founders should find a board of directors or an advisory board: The body responsible for from an outside perspective therefore supporting the founder to get out from instant pressures, and compromising decisions.

The business consultant and author Jim Collins speaks of a related viewpoint that he calls The Personal Board of Directors:

For Jim, it’s a collection of minds, being people you have direct contact or not; basically the collective intelligence that you can make it to be embodied in your strategy.

Thinking from legendary (and non-legendary but great) thinkers can always offer us great narratives that are strong and based in a lot of prior thoughts.

We should find our ways to make better use of past knowledge as we move on in the present.
