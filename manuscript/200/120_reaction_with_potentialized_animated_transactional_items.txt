## The Jar of Happiness and the Accelerated Potential in Everything

One fine day, I, not particularly hungry, was on my way to the bakery to pick bread for my mother-in-law. I'm not especially attracted to sweets but somehow I became curious about the assortment of cakes and desserts in the display, one in special. As my eyes scanned the options they have settled on a peculiar item which brought my pupils to dilate. It was a sort of cupcake in a transparent plastic cup, much like a pint glass, comprised of several layers of something. Up to that point it seemed normal. But then, it had another common desert on top - a condensed milk pudding. That seemed to be the sort of item that elicits the phrase that many Brazilian know, nowadays, that "Brazilians need to be studied."

You might not see the above as a problem but the sweet product that was placed on top is a common desert that stays on its own. It's being around like that. Apparently, somehow, someone thought that putting the pudding on top of the cupcake would add value. But I wasn't there to deal with that jar, as a consumer. Since I was intrigued, I have asked the attendant what that was. That's when she revealed the name as "The Jar of Happiness." At that moment, I could feel the allure that the jar - and its title - could exert on the life of a mortal who loves sweets. To me, it was an odd curiosity. So I had the time to imagine if the jar was animated, trying to sell itself. Hey buddy, I am the jar of happiness. I am here to charm you, to delight your day. After that moment, I walked out nervously, kicking the air. A few pigeons nearby flew away.

Later, when everything calmed down, I recalled the imaginary situation (if jars could talk) and a sad realization came to me, which forms the basis for this reflection: These jars were talking. Many items, products, services, or methods, are in front of us, in the displays of life; when we go out looking for something. My motivation for this article springs from this alarming reality. It starts with the moment when we go out, as we're looking for something. We no longer go out just to do nothing. And this predisposition is the hook for us being besieged at spaces, before display windows, websites, search results, and more. 

With this predisposition of ours - a need and a search - and the psychological harassment we experience when witnessing these "communicating products," we're halfway to what comes next - the transactional potential - which is our tendency to act, buy, engage, read, decide, you name it. The forward movement that every seller wants, that every solution needs, if they could speak. As they do. 

## The Situation

We're constantly surrounded by options promising to help us accomplish tasks, solve problems, and reach our goals. Consider the electric oven ready to bake a pizza. Or a hotel room, available for a comfortable stay. Or that Jar of Happiness promising to satisfy our hunger and desire for sweets. Apparently, the situation is unremarkable in a world where we're no longer startled by what the displays promise. But another situation or phenomenon (needs verification to call it a phenomenon), embedded in this situation, comes from competition for consumer attention. The jars are vying for consumer attention. Jars, rooms, ovens, and other products, services, processes, methods, etc.

Indeed, it could not be different in a world of competing solutions. A company can create a better saw if it better understands the job-to-be-done1 of a carpenter facing a need. Once this product better meets the need, it becomes an available solution. This available solution can then be made available to potential customers. For this, positioning, a message, is important. When the product is displayed in real or digital shop windows, this product is contextualized within a story, a promising story.

But coming back to the user, or customer, consider the person who goes about life solving their problems; or better yet, accomplishing a job. They might, almost automatically, find themselves under pressure to choose. Of course, this pressure doesn't come from the fact that products and services are screaming for our attention; but because they present a transactional potential that is appealing.

Consider Uber's service, for example. We're no longer just choosing between taking a taxi or driving ourselves. Now, we have a myriad of Uber options at our disposal, each promising a slightly different travel experience. We have UberX, the most affordable option for daily commutes. Uber Comfort, offering newer and roomier cars for a more comfortable ride. Uber Black, for when we want to travel in style in a luxury black car. UberXL, for when we need a larger car to accommodate a larger group. UberSUV, for when we want the luxury of Uber Black, but in an SUV. UberPOOL, where we share our ride with other passengers to save money. Uber Green, for those preferring electric or hybrid vehicles. Uber Pet, for when we're travelling with our furry friends. Uber Assist, for those needing extra assistance getting in and out of the vehicle. And Uber WAV, for passengers who need a wheelchair-accessible vehicle. And that's just to name a few.

Now, imagine being presented with this list of options every time you need a ride. Often, the decision we make isn't based on what we genuinely need, but rather on what's most attractive or convenient at the moment.

### No Time to Awaken

True awakening could occur if we could see beyond the enticing promises, if we could question the real value these tools and systems bring to our lives. If we had time to realize that we are constantly bombarded with appeals and promises, we could start resisting this pressure and making more conscious choices. But the most complex factor about this pressure is that it doesn't feel like pressure. We don't feel it. That day when I startled the pigeons, someone ordered the Jar of Happiness and didn't even notice the pressure, the narrative, the jar's screams.

### The Three Levels of Harassment

These items battle and in a way exert a form of harassment on our minds, given that we encounter them after going out to address a need. The first level of harassment - I'll call it the harassment of promise - is tied to the fact that these items communicate, promise immediate results. We are attracted to the idea that we can obtain a solution for what we want, now, without the need to wait or work for it. Many of the jars on bakery shelves are ready for consumption. Similarly, those wanting to bake a cake can find a ready solution for cookies in the supermarket's cake aisle.

The second level of harassment is the abundance of options. We are constantly navigating in front of tools and systems, each of which is promising to be better than the last. This can lead us to a state where we spend more time pondering which option to choose, bypassing the fundamental question of whether we need it at all.

The third level of harassment is the extras. These are all the impacts we will accumulate after deciding to engage with the items. We make a decision, we know it's good to decide. The world congratulates us for it. However, often these extras are the impact, the marginal cost, the unexpected outcome. If that Jar of Happiness were indeed animated, it probably wouldn't shout warning about the consequences, the post-consumption impact.

### Reflective Conclusion

In a world full of options, it's easy to be drawn in by the promise of immediate results. However, it's important to remember that the most attractive or convenient option is not always the best for us. The idea of stopping, reflecting, and making conscious choices is simply not popular anymore. It might sound inappropriate, especially given the potential of the decision, the pressure that starts within us as we're spinning in the life's gear, at work. After all, nobody goes out to buy bread because they are taking a stroll. If we could do things differently, maybe we could avoid the pressure and focus on what really matters to us.

At these times, facing the jars of happiness and the lists of options in the ride-sharing app menu, it would be good to be able to stop, pause over our almost automatic inclination to choose and decide. Imagine if we could ask ourselves:

Does this really meet my needs?
Will this truly help me achieve my goals?
Or am I just being drawn in by the promise of immediate results?
By asking questions like these, you're already slowing down and may be able to make more conscious choices in a world full of options. And maybe, just maybe, you can start to see these "living" products and services with new eyes - the eyes of a critic, not a pressured consumer.

I can't say that I was conscious, intentional, when I found the bizarre jar. Remember that I wasn't there to eat candy, or even to eat. My chance to see the jar screaming came from the fact that I wasn't a consumer at the right time. I could only look and analyze the situation with an external view.

To "seal" a thought, and maybe even an opportunity. Consider if you could, one day, go to the supermarket after a large lunch. On that trip, try forcing yourself on a mission to buy things. Try to spend 5 minutes at each aisle, reflecting on how the products are communicating, how the products are screaming. Try to look over the products, those many that say "buy me, eat me, use me." And see that today they no longer clamor for your attention with mere screams. They project promises directly, without shouting.

Now, these jars of solutions are everywhere. Reflect on the services, methodologies, systems. Notice how everything around you is promising. Notice how everything is appealing. How everything, as the Brazilian would say, grabs attention. Notice how you are likely trapped into the category of a promise, like a car or a pizza or a methodology for growing your start-up. Notice how we are likely comparing among options and being proud of looking for the best deal among. Notice how we are pulled towards decision, to move forward. Notice how consequences from deciding have less to do with the original promise and how solutions and decisions creates other events.
