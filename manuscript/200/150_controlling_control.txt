Success will happen. It's a generally accepted idea, otherwise we wouldn't be willing to learn, to put an effort for a better future. But after that idea, when we consider and coordinate our actions with that inclination, it is not uncommon when we face situations such as "I don't understand why every time that something works then things out of the sudden falls apart. " And even other situations that pushes our mind into considering that something else, as in "out of this world" is harming our way. 

The price we pay for trying to control success, or specifically the outcome we want, is that it drags us to a darker place, a very difficult condition, for when things does not work. But worse, a complication, that the more we lock a target for success, such as the more we focus in an specific outcome, the more we increase the chances for the outcome to come out differently as we have locked ourselves in the first place, as we wouln't be in a good position to see that things can be different. The real problem is not that we get mad, or get frustrated, when we find the confrontation that a bit effort will fail. What is under it is that we might engage with the process and without allowing a listening as things are happening. And even worse, when we don't have time to understandm and we are not aware that we are influencing the process in the first place. 

Now, we have already reflected about ourselves as a carrier [check this], or a train, e section "Entrepreneurship success". What if we do act like more like a technology product, such as a social network tool, that can carry on good or bad things, like shit, but it is not punished as its role is centered around being useful. It's for communication, transfer, connection, and accessibility. What if we can just see carriers, professional carriers. If we put our expectation in the carrier, as opposed to what we want to deliver, perhaps we can do a good job and improve our chances to deliver better things as well. 

But it is challenging to to this, of course, to distance ourselves and to fully grasp that the stuff we deliver is not the stuff we want. As in to put ourselves in the situation of carying less for the outcome. To put ourselves to care for our ability to carry or the process. And this is not to imply, of course, that we are careless. But it is to imply that we can act like a locomotive owner whose responsibility is to care care of the passengers to the destination. In a way, the direction we are going here, is of you trying to regulate your control with meta-control. In the train trip analogy, you become responsible for evaluating the trip. 

If trying to control the outcome happens with you, which can be difficult to observe, I wonder if you can come up with exercises to treat yourself in the good ways. I tell you of an episode that happened with me and where I sort of stumbled in a winning situation after the fact that I gave up my controller way of working. I can't say what really supported me to drop control at that point. But after the events were unfolding, I can say that a lot of the episodes where I was able to drop my controller have helped me to achieve the actual winning results. I won't event forget that trip to Austin, Texas. 

Mozilla, the company that is known for the popular Firefox browser, was a company which I had resigned in 2009. But since they were an open source project, I found a way to be around them, as a volunteer. Around 2010, they ran a challenge in partnership with the McArthur Foundation, where developers could join to "Expand Possibities for Learning Online" [^mozillamcarthur]. 

[^mozillamcarthur]: In collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation, Mozilla launched the Jetpack for Learning Design Challenge, aimed at developing Firefox add-ons to enhance online learning. The initiative leveraged Mozilla's technology, enabling the creation of add-ons using standard web technologies. Select innovators from this challenge were invited to a three-day intensive Learning Design Camp in March 2010, coinciding with SXSW Interactive, where the best works received public recognition. https://www.macfound.org/press/grantee-news/design-challenge-to-expand-possibities-for-learning-online

It was a sort of selection so it started with interested developers but a number of phases led to 10 of us that where invited SxSw to refine the work where judges would select three as winners. I was among the ones that joined the final stage. As a developer and participant, my solution was something to be proud of. It was an annotation system to help students to share their annotations while a professor were giving a live lecture, as in sharing notebook. During the days there, we had opportunities to improve our prototypes and to get feedback. And I caught myself in a situation that has happened many times in my life, which is when I tend to work more, the more I move toward the judgement day. 

Now, just by writing this, I just remembered an episode that has happened a couple years before that, when I was helping Mozilla to come to Brazil at a conference and just before the president of Mozilla was to speak to a reporter, I sadly report to them that I was having headaches. I noticed something on their face that didn't totally understand until years later, that had do to with what now I see as question: Why? Why I pushed myself into a situation which brought me to suffer and to put the moment of delivery in risk? Perhaps, by 2010, my subconscious were yet grasping what has happened that day. I can't say. 

But going to Austin, and as the days were approaching, I had a sudden idea for a new movement. I have decided to give up. Not like the one that puts so much effort and started to judge intensely, likely with headaches, and gives up. But to give up in the sense of giving up control. Although I didn't had a guide for what I did, I have told myself that I would only work in removing features from that point on. And a derived thinking came from there too: I will listen to feedback. Therefore, in a more relaxed state, I was about to meet a new Marcio. By the way, a number of friends from my days at Netscape and Mozilla where there so I was happy to be around them and we had an opportunity to go out too. But as the refinement effort was happening I caught myself able to listen, and was able to remove things from my system, as opposed to adding thing which would be my normal way of working. 

In addition, and since it was a prototype, I had to face the fact that since not much features were there, I would need to consider presentation, the story. So then, as the pitch day approached, as I started to consider my 6-minute presentation, again I had another fight and decision. It turned out that the "What to say" part wasn't done yet. To make things worse, I was the last to present. I somehow thought that being the last was really bad. But then a friend said that it was nice that I was last. And perhaps because I was in listening mode his idea provoked me to look from that side, to seek opportunities. With my presentation slides ready and the pitches happening I was getting nervous. The presenters were recieving feedback right after. But again, and out of the sudden perhaps influenced by that "mode of operation" of giving up control, I  caught myself listening to what initially appeared to be criticism, but in fact it was feedback, of the judges. And caught myself quickly changing some aspects in my slides. 

It is highly arguable that I was, in a way, controlling the output, right? Taking advantage of the situation, or thinking that I was taking advantage. But see, although we will always do something to find a better outcome, the real point for me is that I was less rigid and open. The idea to change slides before the talk would not be accepted in my normal way. A special situation, or complication, came too. It turned out that some other teams were also working with annotation system ideas similar to mine. And one of the judges, after watching the repetition, were frustrated indicating negativeness after seeing another annotation system. At that moment I was about to panic, feeling the "oh no" as in I am not only the last but also the last annotation system. But somehow, again and perhaps anchored in that new place of giving up my controller, and time approaching, I had a light that also had to do with listening to feedback and removing things. I had decided to start saying "Yet another annotation system." And that was how I started, and I have controlled indeed perhaps gamed the system, but it was quite new and surprising my process of again and again and again dropping my controller. I knew that my presentation was much better than that other of the normal Marcio. That is the only thing I knew and a few other things such as being calm, not having headaches. The judgement moment was to happen in the afternoon but as I stumbled in one of the judges after lunch, he asked me if that idea was my startup. To which I said, no I am working in something else. Later that day I caught myself among the three finalists and it was nice to get a prize from Mozilla and McArthur foudation.  

But the real prize was to come back to all that has happened, that had less to do with planning and more with a decision in front of taking a controller pill versus taking the give-up-control pill. I am not saying that I didn't do a good and planned, or controlled job, to start with. But I have recognized that the moments of "giving up" were the things that led to winning. I knew that my normal Marcio would just never get there. One thing should be said. That the giving up required myself to surrender, to release, my willingness to win. Therefore, for me, the big prize I won, was the lesson about control, beyond the learnings of the contest, even cooler than having received a  prize from the gentlement known as Joy Ito [^joiito].

[^joiito]: Joi Ito, a Japanese entrepreneur, served as the director of the MIT Media Lab from 2011 to 2019. Renowned for his role in the growth of digital technology and as an early advocate of the Internet in Japan, Ito has made significant investments in tech ventures and maintained affiliations with institutions like the MacArthur Foundation. 

## Allowance for failure 

We're all controllers. Why? Because we like playing it safe. We control things around us just to feel we're in control. Don't beat yourself up about it, it's a natural thing.

But here's where things get a bit tricky. When we have to juggle between 'doing' and 'creating', we tend to stick to the safe side. And let's face it, that doesn't really help the creative side of us. Great execution is nice, but if you want to bring something new to the table, you can't just follow a set path. Innovation isn't a map, it's more like an uncharted journey.

Abraham Maslow, the psychologist, talks about this in his management theory. He says that creative people can handle uncertainty better than those who always want to play it safe. So, the problem is: how do you let yourself get a bit out of control to make room for creativity?

Sounds odd, but to do this, you'll actually need some control. The idea is to set up a space where you can afford to loosen your grip, especially when you need some fresh ideas.

Here's a start: let yourself fail. And give yourself time to fail. When you catch yourself thinking "this is a waste of time", watch out! That's your control reflex talking. Want to manage uncontrolled? Here's a tip: take baby steps.

Don't jump into the deep end right away. Start by setting up little safe zones where you can let your creativity flow. Pick a time, a date, a moment. Run with it. Then, go back to your routine. Think of it as your creativity sandbox.

Go ahead, go with your fears on the side. Don't try to set them aside, that's just more controlling. Remember, it's okay to be a bit uncontrolled. It can be your secret weapon for creativity. So, get comfortable with a little chaos. Your next big idea could be just around the corner. Just remember to create your sandbox first.
