# Managing the Unmanaged: Your New Strategy for Creativity

We're all controllers. Why? Because we like playing it safe. We control things around us just to feel we're in control. Don't beat yourself up about it, it's a natural thing.

But here's where things get a bit tricky. When we have to juggle between 'doing' and 'creating', we tend to stick to the safe side. And let's face it, that doesn't really help the creative side of us. Great execution is nice, but if you want to bring something new to the table, you can't just follow a set path. Innovation isn't a map, it's more like an uncharted journey.

Abraham Maslow, the psychologist, talks about this in his management theory. He says that creative people can handle uncertainty better than those who always want to play it safe. So, the problem is: how do you let yourself get a bit out of control to make room for creativity?

Sounds odd, but to do this, you'll actually need some control. The idea is to set up a space where you can afford to loosen your grip, especially when you need some fresh ideas.

Here's a start: let yourself fail. And give yourself time to fail. When you catch yourself thinking "this is a waste of time", watch out! That's your control reflex talking. Want to manage uncontrolled? Here's a tip: take baby steps.

Don't jump into the deep end right away. Start by setting up little safe zones where you can let your creativity flow. Pick a time, a date, a moment. Run with it. Then, go back to your routine. Think of it as your creativity sandbox.

Go ahead, go with your fears on the side. Don't try to set them aside, that's just more controlling. Remember, it's okay to be a bit uncontrolled. It can be your secret weapon for creativity. So, get comfortable with a little chaos. Your next big idea could be just around the corner. Just remember to create your sandbox first.
