--> 

At any time, a sense of urgency can take the attention of the startup team; which is generally not too bad, as to work in what is urgent comes with a direction, even if it is so to maintain some equilibrium, to sustain a value. But it is also the case that teams - under the consideration of their future - can be concerned that focusing on what is urgent could can put the future at risk. Let us reflect about the things that changes, as the startup advances, and how feedback interferes with how the team prioritizes their activities, such as to get stuck with urgent and non-important activites. 

It comes a day when the team is concerned that some important work is not being done as the team is too busy. This discussion can be explored using the Eisenhower matrix [^footnote_matrix_important_vs_urgent], where the urgent axis intersects with the important axis, resulting in four quadrants: urgent and important, urgent and non-important, non-urgent but important, and non-urgent non-important. Should this matrix appear or not, the core of the discussion has to do with questions such as "why the urgent work is really urgent?" or "why we aren't we working more on the other things that could change our situation to better?" 

[^footnote_matrix_important_vs_urgent]: 

The discussion shows that something has changed and that new planning is in order because something might be wrong. To illustrate, consider the team that has started with stratetic work, such as the work of discovery of their initial customers. As they found a couple of potential customers, a new reality emerged as they started valuing their customers. In a way, they understood themselves as having achieved maturity, that they had to be responsible to these new customers, such as to keep them happy even if the work to keep that is not too fun. But the new activities also started to affect their time and impacted other discussions such as new strategies that could set team in a new direction, or a better future, such as to consider if these current customers should be left behind so that they could focus on other customers. 

When this discussion happens, it might do so after the team notices a saturation point. A wise team would indeed respect that it was the prior move - such as their success in executing important non-urgent activities - that brought them customers. Conversely, the need to attend those customers, and fears such as of losing these customers, makes initiatives, such as customer support, to become urgent. 

To note, that losing those customers does has double weight - as these customers are yet considered important and leaving them behind would mean being careless for the investment of non-urgent and important work that brought these customers in the first place. In other words, if a team member raises a hand to point that problems will rise with these customers, a "strategic manager" could well reply "that is a problem we want to have." This line of reply, by the very fact that it welcomes good new problems, not only revelas the measurement system but the size of the extra effort - even if it is unknown - to support the equilibrium and which justifies work which gets to be titled as urgent work. What is complicated is the perception that almost take place by the rise of a lonely hand which is generally silenced. In other words, there's someone that notices that the team had indeed started with a kind of work where strategic activities took place first but by the new numbers, e.g. the count of customers, she is now frustrated that the team is busy in with that is seen as good news which for her sounds like to engage in the effort of means to justify the end of sustaining the numbers. She sees the team as a victim of its present reality. This person might be in a way contrarian to what the team is doing - perhaps not so excited anyway - and sees their focus on what is urgent as a problem.

* outline - question - what can we do to see ways to break urgency and be safe into strategic thinking again?
--> 

In perspective, as one or many urgent activities sets in, they are indeed supported by values. And now, any new input with ideas to change the course is now to be compared with the new equilibrium that now needs to be maintained. In other words, the team justifies to stick with what's urgent. Of course, and naturally, as otherwise, they'll be busy trying to go back to the beginnings again. And for them, that means jeopardizing the equilibrium that they have secured in the first place. Nothing can be done unless one really moves beyond frustration and proves the new effort - with data - or if they prove themselves they have failed. Unfortunatelly, in the real world, none of these extremmes happens so fast; which brings us to the question, and the openning to the reflection that follows, which is as natural as why is it that we can't work anymore in the strategic and important things that could save us from being too busy with these urgent things? And can we do to help us get out from the urgencies that can kill strategic thinking and reflection? 

The first analysis that follows the temporal analysis that naturally rises, the story of a reality that started with the initial movement in the past, consisting of high-risk movements of investment, and recognizes that as work started the team naturally gravitated from important not urgent to what they thought as important and urgent but in addition from their success and involvement of the team, a new future was created, bringing up more urgent things to be real, such as unexpected ones, and with that new challenges, such as to the point of mobilizing the team into work within them and also to into the affairs to challenge the new ideas that can be perceived as of a high-risk nature. 

The second aspect looks at the elements of feedback that the team takes in consideration - consciously or not - that happens to set the role of a critic that generally has the power to put the label of urgent to activities, at the rise of the monitoring for these urgent activities, at the valuation of this feedback which go much as to make a team set the bar too high for new proposals such as if one says "it gotta be very important!"  


<!-- 
@meta @note - #compassion #aspect2

Another exercise of reflection, which also follows we will be recognizing success as an allocation of resources which is urgent, thus the means that we make urgent to be urgent, the reflection that feedback systems are present, and the critic or measurment system that makes things appears as critical. As much as attempting to talk about the future seems arbitrary, or a risky idea, even more risky is the actual fact that pushes many to do the things as urgent completely driven by a critic that sets them in the actual not have perspectives, such as driven by values, by principles, and undeniably deniying important things, and raising the bar too much for what is impotarnt, as in lacking compassion.

## The rise of the urgent 






And even more complicated is that this feedback isn't as simple as "that customer isn't/is happy." In reality, it may go all the way into the hidden parts that keeps the system standing. As an illustration, if an electronic system happens to be used to monitor the satisfaction of customers, and if by a chance a customer tried to indicate an interaction through that system and happened to find a problem dealing with the interface, it is not uncommon a reactive work to take place, thus to bring back what is assumed to be the only way where customers can interact. 

But none of that would be a reason to consider urgent vs. important if the seeds of what they planted didn't start to produce fruits or to attract bugs. As a consequence - and a reason to honor this complicated intrusion of the urgent needs - we likely be ourselves or witness teams taking care of killing bugs, or managing the fruits given, or an irrigation system, or new processes that rises to solve the urgencies that keeps the equilibrium of some system which they have bundled which seems to represent meaningful results. In other words, we not only work to keep stability for the things we value but also to mitigate the potential explosion of problems from the maintenance of that stability that would otherwise jeopardize the work. As an aside, this accounting and management around rising problems, or a management of maintenance, can be so well-done by teams that they happen to come up with innovations such as to maintain systems up, solutions for killing bugs, among other communication processes. In other words, we should keep our minds open to the beauty and the dangers of solutions [^editornote_glitch_story] that rises from our needs to keep an equilibrium in any given process. 

[^editornote_glitch_story]: Solutions to manage the management problem is not necessarily a problem as it has to do with that teams actually do. As an example, the death of a game company called Glitch became the formation of one of the world's most popular digital communication tool for teams, Slack. According to Cnet (2013), the communication tool was created to support the development of the game.

### The formation of a parallel reality 






As we first consider part doer job of an entrepreneur, and as we recognize the growth nature of startups, we recognize that projecting a startup in the future goes inline with what an entrepreneurial role may have done in the first place to move from nothing to an action before it took them into bringing the discussion about urgent vs. important. In other words, an uncertain ideal took a doer to do, and they did, which brought saturation, to the point of the need of perspective again, to change, to project a new future. 

A basic illustration is in order, showing how urgent situations arise naturally. If we set our time machine to the old American West around the end of the 1800s and observe a scientist who wanted to become a blacksmith and sell horseshoes, he set up his shop and advertised locally. Soon, he started to have customers. They came in with horses, and he sold horseshoes. Everything was working as expected. Then, one day, a customer came back walking and frustated and claiming that he had lost his horse because of the hourseshoe that got broken. Instinctively, the blacksmith felt compelled to restore the equilibrium because he feared that the situation could affect his customers' perception and wanted to bring back that balance. This came as an almost automatic response, possibly rooted in the principle of loss aversion [^footnote_loss_aversion], a concept that behavioral economics later developed to help many of us to get better the idea that the pain of loss is felt more acutely than the pleasure of equivalent gains. That part of the equation was something the blacksmith understood intuitively and from his ancestors and his present reality without the need to see the future and read any scientific paper. 

Thus, it is fair to think that restoring equilibrium is merely a normal business reaction, clearing the way to keep things running smoothly and focusing on the tasks at hand.

--> 





Now, and leaving the illustration in the past but keeping the essentials, we can then recognize that this new equilibrium that is needed to be maintained is a different present from what he originally expected. Thus, it is a parallel reality. If one had the time to reflect, to ask questions, one would arrive at the conflusion that he or she had indeed imagined a different outcome - such as of happy customers coming in and out with no frustrated or drunk or mad customers for example. But this is now - good or bad - the real present for the doer, the entrepreneur, the team. 

Now and as introduced before, it may be so that one brings up an idea for changing things of this present. It may be so with an specific idea but all of us living the pressure of the present would react accordingly to that and to a provocation that goes along with that, as if that one had in first place asked more time of everyone - the time to consider important activities. It maybe so then that a response of objection naturally rises. It may go as simple as "we don't have time for that" but also it may come with additional sayings such as "can you prove that if we do that it will take us out of this situation which you claim to be bad?" 

This need for proofs, or assurances, is not generallty seen as a bad thing from the viewpoint of the folks that protect the values given in the first place - such as the customers. There is logic in there. But what confuses the frustrated lonely troublemaker is how simple the objections from the team sets in - that the objections land so smooth and it seems even arbitrary; while his attempt to take off his plans are scrutinized with new demands, and proofs, or needs not only a whole blueprint but a coherent proof that is short, like an elevator pitch first. Thus the troublemaker becomes frustrated for the team has such a power to kill the beginning of new plans and moreover the chances for reflections to exist. 

Now, from a mature managerial pespective, all of this makes sense, doesn't it? The troublemaker could be generally a troublemaker. And the team could go all the way to investigate their style, their character, their identity, such as to prove that he or she didn't want really to help the team and wants to be against everything. But that can be an inacurate reading of a real work situation. It is likely to assume that these gatekeepers of value and traction now demand proofs because, in other words, the nature of the situation has changed. Because the new nature brought clarity.  

Now if the troublemaker is in troube in the face of the team for trying to point his finger to their bad use of time with urgencies, his main frustration is really due with the comparison mechanism that appears smoothly brutal - the comparison mechanism that is intuitively used by the team when they balance things out where on one hand they put present value - where the value can't be taken away - and on the other they don't even bother to put the idea but to leave there many questions in the place, asking for a good pitch, good reasons, a good plan, and also assurances. Of course, That logic is well supported by the principled logic of loss aversion. This is part of the defense of the troublemaker but in his privacy he feels that furthermore his team seem quite naive, or romantic, as if they wanted him to take the time machine, to visit the future, and come back with an almanac full of calendars, weather forecasts, statistical data.

* outline - Answer - k1.3 - The business of forecasting indeed solves the puzzle 
--> 




Now if a light exists in this discussion of parallel realities, that can take us to reconsider the new present that could help with a better future - the present that now suffers with the unexpected new conditions that keeps the team busy where no one seem to be frustrated with except the troublemarkers - it comes from the very mechanisms that we are born with, our capacity to plan by forecasting, the very mechanisms that set us to make the tough questions such as "Where are the assurances? The plan? And the coherent pitch?" 

In this direction and wearing the shoes of the troublemaker in the hope that we can fix course-correct our future for the urgencies of the present, let us ride with Andy Grove and consider how to plan around the past, present, and the future, can help our organizations. In "Planning: Today's Actions for Tomorrow's Output" (1983, p.102), Andy invite us to consider our own natural ability of forecasting we do when we are in the cockpit and considering where we are going:

<!--

--> 

> *"For instance, as you're driving to work in the morning, you are likely to decide whether or not you need gasoline. You look at the gauge to see how much gas you have in the tank, you estimate how far it is you need to go, and you then make a rough guess as to how much gas you need to get to and from your office. By comparing in your mind the gas you need with the gas you have, you decice whether you should stop for gas or not."* (Grove, 1983, p.102)

<!-- 
@meta @references 
* Reference - Grove, Andrew. (1983). High Output Management. Vintage Books.
--> 

It is also his reminder that this is what management actually does. So first honoring Andy's managerial viewpoint ... 

This is where he asks us to consider two time frames, the present versus sometime in the future (1983, p.104). But in order to compare anything, analogy of a factory, which is essentially a way to provoke us to visualize that the efforts made by workers can be framed, or packaged, like a functional unit that has inputs and outputs. A simple but meaningful example would be the breakfast factory where inputs can be things like eggs, and other resources, tools, and the processes; while output is what is aimed, such as the eggs served to attend customer needs. But in essence, the intent to frame a process as a factory represents an opportunity to freeze the situation in time so that analysis of the different timeframes can be done. 

By isolating your process, the first step of planning starts with the examination of the aspects which you are interested in improving for your "factory". As an example, imagine that attending custom needs of all the customers while being considered urgent it is costing a lot and preventing time that could be used in other strategic activities. The second step is to consider the situation of now, the status of your "factory" in the sense of the accountability of what happens, the efforts that take place, which transforms the inputs in outputs. In the example, imagine that there is a help desk service which is kept running, 24x7 as your customers may appear at any time. And that you have costs associated with that. Finally the third step involves projecting a new future where you can consider the growth situation and the goals in long term, such as customer satisfaction, and with that you make projections of how the current factory would produce as results if, say in one year, your customers had grown to 100 - assuming such goal is acceptabel to the situation of a future. The result of the exercise may show that the help desk service would not be able to attend; which would create a gap considering the new demands in growth, which would provoke the team to consider solutions to fill the gap, which normally could start with just growing the help desk, although such basic notion of productivity would also prompt the team to consider ways to improve the efficacy of the customer service in new ways, under the recognition that customers happy were the ultimate goal. 

Therefore, by creating different time frames, and by recognizing growth areas, and by recognizing the ultimate goals, the team gains perspectives about new activities to be considered as important in contrast with known and current urgent activities. Conversely, the maturity is revealed by the understanding that "the factory" is the place where activities happening exist to add value towards the expected better future, which undeniably requires the courage to bring about the conversations, or projections such as different outcomes, which accounts the reexamination of goals, the conditions of now, and the various activities in place in order to get there. And back to the case or urgency, or how to break the feedback of urgency, new perspectives are gained - in terms of strategic reasoning - as we are able to new valuation for a current feedback by the frames of a projected future reality, or grown up reality. 

To give an example of improved perspectives Andy suggested how key indicators can gain new dimensions. A simplest dimension of a key indicator for the situation of the floor cleaned is the numer of square feet cleaned and is likely that the small experiment would not need to account the need to monitor quality. While the situation of a grown-up space, with thousands of square feet to be cleaned, would justify new indicators that, according to Andy, "should be paired with a partially objective/partially subjective rating of the quality of work as assessed by a senior manager with an office in that building." (1983, p.17) 

To give an example of improved perspectives, consider the situation of the floor cleaned in a small space, as measured by a key indicator as the number of square feet cleaned. In this scenario, generally monitoring quality might be just about measuring the numbers. While the situation of a grown-up space, with thousands of square feet to be cleaned, would justify the need for a new indicator that "should be paired with a partially objective/partially subjective rating of the quality of work as assessed by a senior manager with an office in that building" (Grove, 1983, p. 17).

In other words, it becomes clear that new aspects of evaluation and judgment are applicable on top of what is initially a single feedback that is outsanding; that this new evaluation enters the system of evaluation in ways that support goals. This situation also shows that some of the numbers we monitor might lead us to take them as supportive of other values, this leading us to allow the intrusion or editing of the feedback with a new perspective, and new meaning. And needless to say that under pressure, we might assume that data pouring in means value captured or the conditions towards value being supported. But we shouldn't miss the point of wisdom from Andy which is given by the identification of the pairing indicator - which makes evident the origin of the case which starts with the idea that a single indicator is not enough - as it supports the forward movement.

--> 




Now if one wanted to get involved with such forecasting, such as to provoke the team to give up some urgent activities, that should involve the effort of getting buy-in, and the agreement, from the team; to get involved with the matter, which is quite complicated because they are quite involved in the present matters by the logic that we had considered before.

Therefore, the troublemarker shall then embrave the leadership position in order to move on and that involves to have the buy-in from the team, at a minimal level to support the planning exercise. To to that, some ideas for an objective approach to do that is first to have a clear communication and to understand what everyone is doing in the present, and that involves the aspects of transparency. The other component is to get to understand the goals of everyone and teams and everyone involved because then you know what they are actually doing. But since you cannot know exactly what they're gonna find out in the future and the consequences like the urgent consequences for everyone's job, you may try to access and asses that by looking to the values that justifies their goals which can be associated with their objectives or other high-order goals or aspirations or values that keeps them doing what they do and makes them to justify the positions they take. In other words, the work of forecasting in the realm of the political affairs, the things with the future, shows in part a sort of forensic work because you're sort of excavating starting with what is real and trying to reach out to the values aiming to forecast the ties with urgencies. With that said, let us explore a bit about the values that affect the entrepreneurial work space and a lot the startup growth path, from the beginning and their future, and within how the feedback that grows with the growth is valued and supports the values.

* outline - Answer - k2 - How feedback enters 
--> 

## The valuation of feedback 





Now, the very approach of spliting time frames and the reflection about the indicators, such as when they are paired with strategic new indicators, bring us to the complication that we do engage in valuation of feedback because feedback supports value which are taken securities for us to reach that expected future. Thus essentially, the split exercise has to do with considering alternatives, in other words it is about establishing a window into the process, about evaluating the feedback being received. But also essentially revels the other fight, or management job, which is to reason through what happens in the space of feedback, more specificially how teams measure and value what they do. 

Now, to recap, it is fair to assume that a perspective of judgement - for all matters of use of resources and time - has changed as value captured from certain actitivies has entered a feedback cycle, and it in a way or another supports values, values that supports the perception of success of the team. In other words, comes the conclusion that we are naturally driven by feedback - either planned and objective, or unplanned and subjective. And what is even worse is that the feedback that we value, that supports urgent to be accounted as urgent, although can be very subjective, it translates in objective aversion to any new idea, or to set clear demands or objective returns or assurances, for anything that does not retro-feed the given value. In other words, the paradox lies if we envision the extremmes: how easy it is to get approved activites that seem to support urgent vs. how difficult it is to get approved new important non-urgent category. 

Now, and before we move on to into how we use and misuse feedback systems, it must be stated that the reflection that follows celebrates feedback- it embraces a natural gift of our human operating system's evolution, to which we can monitor and improve the narratives of our lives. In other words, we should acknowledge that we don't get into the business of monitoring the things we do and value for the sake of being in the same place, static. In the end of the day, we do want to be safe so that we can mess up with risky activities that may provide reward, which may happen to bring about notions of transcendence, growth, success, happiness, and the like. 

Thus, if we were programmed to value valuable things, we do so that we can continue to invest. Like good friends, we value, we keep them around, and with them around, we hope to feel in better condition to move on and improve our lives. Therefore, an exploration of navigating feedback with family is friends is first given for the sake of our reflection on how feedback shows strong ties with values. Then, we move on advancing with other situations of growth of teams, establishing a perspective for how the presence of vibrant feeback, in the sense of steady or present, becomes valuated by teams in the face of perceived present values that are assumed to be values that enables further growth. All these reflections are here so that we can gain a point of view, in perspective, about how strong we give value to feedback and possible misinterpretations that either lies or are strong enough to not even allow us to seek to see through, to transcend, to reflect and interpret the real values we seen, then to life potential activities that can be more strategic. 





### The amateur feedback 





Starging with feedback from family and friends, although it may not directly explain how teams use feedback to define what is urgent, it is a good starting point for the reflection about how feedback ties with values. 

It is quite common, as entrepreneurs and teams begin their efforts, to exist interactions of seeking feedback from close networks such as seeking feedback from family and friends. It could be that, by doing so, a team is actually exercising navigating by feedback more than actually trying to pull precise truths such as if they are on the right track. But being for one or another reason, it is real that it happens such as in the beginnings where they are more lonely [^footnote_sam_altman_entrepreneurs_lonely], when local network inteaction happens to characterize them trying to reach higher networks of support that supports growth. 

[^footnote_sam_altman_entrepreneurs_lonely]:

As for the feedback by friends and friends, one topic considered is honesty. The difficulty with seeking feedback at this stage starts with the fact that the entrepreneur, project or team, wants to achieve success in the future. So this need, if not an urgency, sets a dilemma as any feedback for the the reality of now is likely to mess up with the opportunity and the future yet to be constructed. 

Therefore, talking about family and friends is acceptable, as these folks happen to be in the same nest or in a way or another their engagement in the interaction is the very proof of acceptance of the subjectiveness of the interaction and the recognition of the dilemma. An friend of an entrepreneur, for example, not only accepts the half-way idea presented but does so under the viewpoint that the direction matters more which makes the discussion valid in the face of values, so that appropriate feedback is given so that the entrepreneur can be saved from trouble. 

The same happens with family, depending on the family culture, as the received feedback might not be honest because the person wants to motivate, or in other extremme demotivate. In other words, these folks are not free from the dilemma - where opportunity and risks are compared with the a path that is taken as of certaintly. In other words, through what appears to be an exercise of feedback, it happens to be discussions about investments that takes towards positive or negative values. Entrepreneur Adora Cheung went all the way to explore the topic through a viewpoint referred as "The Honesty Curve" (How to Start a Startup, 2014, 21:18), indicating that there are people who will lie. Let's look her example of a possible curve. On the vertical axis, she shows honesty level while on the horizontal axis, different kinds of relationships starting with the mother, then friends, then people.

<!--
@meta @todo
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In The Feedback of Urgency - Consider to bring back the image from Adora - honesty curve - perhaps not to the text but to reflect on it and to explain it better - ![Curva da honestidade](images/adora/honesty.png) - @meta-refid 8585-9393-9294-4848 
--> 

Adora presents two curves showing the level of honesty in the feedback given by different types of people. First, let's look at an offering that is not free showed by the red curve, for example, a paid product. In this case, according to Adora, a mother is likely to be less honest. As she move towards friends, she considers that honesty improves. She concludes that, for paid products, the further you go towards anonymous people, the more honesty you will see.

Then one might say — ah, but my mother is straightforward - and all my friends are honest with me. The problem is really knowing the perspective that each person had at the time of giving the feedback. What they wanted when they were giving the feedback. It may be that person X would change their view precisely because they have a degree of friendship with you and want the best for you. 

But what could we learn from this? that you cannot launch your snack cart by following the advice of your mother and family members? In fact it matters more the abstraction that their feedback has to be driven by values. And even more that  the situation of seeking feedback from friends necessarilly accepts values to get in the way as, again, without that acceptance it would be too early to be driven by data-driven feedback that could kill the whole effort in the first place. 

And in that regard, matters too the need to improve the awareness about the forms that feedback is shaped by these underlying values that gets in the way. The map of Adora, as an example, explores the honesty level the more you move towards anonymous people, in other words, the feedback given varies by the nature of the values being considered and the more we move to the right side, with more concrete experiments, the move precise data we find that are linked - objectively or subjectively - to values that are taken as good to move growth forward. 

Yet within the realm of friends, professor and psychologist Adam Grant, in the book "Give or Take" [^editornote_adamgrant_give_or_take], had given another chart with four types of people in the quadrants generated by two axis. On the vertical axis, at the top, he has set a person referred to as a giver, and at the bottom a taker, a person who wants everything for themselves. On the horizontal axis, on the right side is the negative-disagreeable type, and on the left side is the positive-agreeable type:

[^editornote_adamgrant_give_or_take]: In the book Give or Take Adam grant explores the behaviors of people giving feedback and how feedback changes depending on characteristics of who gives feedback.

--> 

Adam suggests that the best profile to seek feedback from is someone who likes to help but does so in a disagreeable or honest manner. That is, someone who doesn't necessarily agree with everything you say but still remains on your side — someone who keeps saying, “look, I think this won’t work because of such and such.” For Adam, a mother is usually in the quadrant of those who want to help but agree with everything because she is influenced by the relationship.

The main point is about the degree of honesty offered by people is that honest appears to fail feedback based on values are honestly shown as perceived by the giver in a given context. In other words, a mother is programmed to care, and to deal with an emotional being that may or may not survive, and so she adjusts her honesty level accordingly, such as 90%. Moreover, it becomes relevant to know who these people are, what they care, what are the values that they are considering, and the like. In the case of a Meat Skewer business, it may not be good to get feedback from vegans. Or looking at it another way, one could consider to get feedback from the contrarian group in order to discover other values. Thus, in the end, what matters is being aware that data appears as feedback to support certain values given by the perception given - a task more important than getting the feedback itself.





### Protected by values 





To contextualize, we are driving to the right side of growth, towards accessing what is honest feedback, which reveals the complication of higher risk, as data are expected to be stronger in terms of representation of signal; still our analysis moves slightly away of the higher degree of subjectiveness given by the prior section but yet explores the strong intent to shortcut feedback with values which drives behavior, such as to the point of preventing different views.  

Now imagine an experienced and successful psychologist who uses a time machine to visit herself fifteen years ago, on the first day a client was late. Today, her clients are rarely late, as they are, let's say, well-trained. But as she went back, the she of the present is astonished to see that her past self had greeted that late client with a big smile and even a hug. She thinks now, "Wow, did I use to hug my patients?" Indeed, she seemed to have celebrated their late arrival, as in reassuring to a friend that everything was okay, as if they were brothers. It is now clear that the psychologist from the past was happy, as if she was supporting the client's tardiness, not for the sake of being late, but as a sort of ethical protocol of compassion.

Moving forward after looking back, she wonders if she wanted to look nice, as in if that behavior was a form of protection linked her insecurities as she feared to lose the client. She also remembers the context, when she had five patients, when she was quite happy to have five patients. That plus the fact that she was genuinely helping that late person, that she cared about them. Today, she has fifty patients and most of them are on time, as she knows that allowing them to attent their sessions late brings problems for themselves and also for her entire work situation. One the other hand, she feels a bit sad when she has to make tough decision such as when she needs to cancel a client who misses three consecutive appointments.

The passage might show the complex situation that professionals would face as they are called to face the challenges of entrepreneurship, especially when they trained as specialists such as the case of a psychologist. This situation would naturally set the professional, now in the position of an entrepreneur, as to not recognize how the growth of their business depends on other factors. In other words, the psychologist of the past had a strong belief that the core element of her practice, to which the possibility of growth would happen, heavily lied in the doing good to the patients such as  following the practices of her specialization, her experience as a psychologist professional, and other aspects of the professional. This idea could even go all the way to support the perception that if one is too good as a professional, the problems, or good problems of the grown up business, would be solved by a system of support that they like have as they are successful. 

So, even though it may indeed be a problem, one could well be inclined to rather deal with the issue on the day when they have 50 clients, with an assuption that growth will continue to happen and that problems, such as 10% of them are running late, are either acceptable or solvable at such future point of success. It's like that "good bad news" everyone dreams of. 

With this, it becomes difficult to transcend, interpret, and try to create ways for a new future to pave the way for improvements, considering that it is assumed that certain potentially important things are actually hindered by principles, like: at this moment, I can't do this to these people. Consider the complex situation, according to Reid Hoffman in The Startup of You, where a relationship of friendship creates a difficult situation for honest feedback, and this explains how difficult it is to fire a friend in the company.

> *""* Reid Hoffman, Startup of You. 

To note, the very point of Reid - honest feedback - actually in fact stamps the complication, as an young professional having issues with a friend, is likely unable to transcend the friendship to a point of achieving clarity that, as an example, to see firing a friend as doing good. With that, the possibility of supporting the friend - the needs of the present - gets in the way. Therefore, and not unlike the mom situation, honesty for the younger relationship would perhaps boil down to saving a friend in front of present needs, even if the future business is compromised. While honesty from the viewpoint of a mature relationship in a business environment, would certainly acknowledge a consciousness about the business as an entity [^footnote_conscious_business_fred_kofmann], or mature perspective, where firing the friend is the best thing to do as opposed to keep the person in the business and harming their own future and the future of the business. 

[^footnote_conscious_business_fred_kofmann]: 

The introduction of new models of behavior, although might be recognized as important, is tough to get in the agenda as the values that are present, like having patients, does protect the doer from engaging with practices that are uncertain and which would demand learning. In this regard, it is unescapable the comparison between the value of present results, baked at the simplest level by the notion that execution matters, with what on the other hand, at the simplest level would mean the possilibity of a an effort of a theoretical nature yet to be tested. 

Furthermore, the attachment to numbers, which are captured and perceived as representation of value, may show a version of the urgent entrepreneur-executor that does exercise a basic need to close the gap in the sense of closing the gap towards the final product, reflecting a reaction from an obsession, or pressure, or lack of external viewpoints, which may lead to the a temptation that end is getting closer by a virtue of a movement which disregard the means. This idea aligns with William Zinsser's perspective in "The Tyranny of The Final Product." Zinsser (2006) elaborated on the fixation of a culture oriented toward winning results, noting that professional authors are frequently asked, "How can I sell my writing?" He insists that "if the process is sound, the product will take care of itself, and sales are likely to follow" (p. 254).

But worse than a general inclination, it is equally critical the rise of a characteristic of a kind of criticism that is not "as benevolent" which goes along with the modern version of criticism which is framed by the urges to select, in the sense of filter-first think-later, by using elimination methods which in essence consists of looking at quantitative aspects from data that seems representatives, like measures such as high or low points, thus typical of what a professional judge would do under thepressure of the judgement due date that is outstanding. 

Julia Cameron, in The Right to Write, uncovers a complication from the life of the writer-in-progress where modern criticism plays a role of an adversarial position, given by the circumstances such as school or the media, which is not only bad but different from the kind of benevolent influence (1998, p. 178) that criticism used to be in the sense of supporting and providing encouragement. Needless it is to point that the circunstances of growth, and the demands for validated learning, and tests, makes a pressure for this contest-oriented operational reality that is configured by the evidence of any data point. Here is where we start to get the feeling that what we value in the now is likely to support the end as it is valued by measurable feedback. This goes inline with saying, in other words, that the hunger to measure anything eats strategy for breakfast; which supports the inclination to close the gap by adjusting the processes that makes the numbers, more or less of incrementally, conversely ignore new planning, embrancing change. 

In this direction, the exercise of consciousness can evaluate the values that are assumed to be vital to keep things as they are. In other words, when we connect values with the things we think are feeding this values, we may better achieve clarity about other things we can do that in fact may feed the same values of other underlying values which are even more important. As an illustration tied to the given example, the professional had understood, through a conscious exercise, that accepting patients late in a consistent matter seemed to be about making them happy, about embracing them with compassion, but the consciousness evaluation and reflective exercise had enabled the professional to not only see that such allowance was doing harm more than good, but a whole well-written justificative that had turned out to be a great explanation for the patient on why to try to be on time. After the psychologist had implemented the explanation, she had even confirmed that patients were happier and improving in healthier ways. In other words, the change of behavior had in fact produced a better good which turned out to be perceived as better good for the pacient and the professional and the whole business entity. In other words, the value of having patients happier were slight improved with an idea of healthier which helped to form a healthier relationship which helped the professinal to achieve clarity about what to say and how to train herself. 

Plus, the change, when it is time to apply, will be tough which will need either transparency, explanations, education - thus there is effort, and it pulls into a zone of uncomfort. Just like the professional has to take care of her customers, abstracting beyond the each served event, in a holistic way which in the case of the psychologist professional has to do with the "prontuário"; there is the same in-perfective reflective writing for the entity or group of customers versus the value for the business growth whch relates to what is better for them? What conditions or conditioning of my customers can put me in a good position to help them even more? What customers I will eventually have to educate them or say no. 

It implies that you can create solutions and many of them can even become simple solutions, such as phrases. For example, indicating to participants where the bathroom is or presenting certain points that govern good relationship health. These solutions are implemented in proportion to the transparency of these "regulation" systems, whether in contracts, in hallways, in communications, by other participants, and collaborators. Thus, it might have to do with culture, a culture that regulates the constituents to establish conditions of growth and equilibrium for success, which requires placing the customer in certain categories and under certain behaviors too.





#### The facets of pleasing 






In the prior chapter, we have considered a reflection about the trap of pleasing, or over-pleasing, where we have focused in the case where pleasing offered a wall which prevented entrepreneurs to see through, to access value ahead. Now, in the context of the priorization of activities, it is worth first to recognize the essence of pleasing which may have roots in the needs for approval, endorsement, support. Therefore, and differentiating from the openning given by the prior chapter, although pleasing might have honorable beginnings, the dynamics of these relationships such as customer relationship, relationships through product and offering, may lead to the complex situation which is illustrated by the extremme, over-pleasing, which is when who offers the offering essencially engages in a behavior alike to the situation of a mom as depicted, which conversely may be seen as lack of honesty, although by the self usually recognized as - I am offering another level of value such as "I care about you" or "I love you," which essencially reveals what can be for some perceived as a fraud, or a corruption, but nevertheless shows that time and resources might be wasted.   

Therefore, as they venture into networking and interactions with the goals of growth, entrepreneurs are often eager to engage with external interactions to get their approval, which may include interactions through the offerings. The situation gets complex then when feedback gets in the way which appears to have worked, that it is pleasing indeed. Yet, through these efforts to cater to this feedback assumed to be supportive, entrepreneurs may drift away from their original vision and core values. In other words, in this effort to please, which sometimes gets confused with offering value, they might lose the very essence that could have shaped a unique and remarkable solution, they can delay facing a real problem, and so on. 

It should be noted that pleasing might be used strategically or not as a process of learning. In the situation of Perseverance, the first known steamboat service by the inventor John Fitch refered in part one, free food and drinks were offered as movement of desperation (Klein, 2009, p. 46) that didn't save the service from failure. Therefore, the pleasing wasn't enough to create a confusion to the team, such as to obfuscate the built-in problems with the offering. 

Consider the world of gastronomy around us, a restaurateur begins her journey with a unique vision: offering a single, well-crafted vegan pizza each day. However, as she starts responding to customer feedback and revenue pressures, she introduces more variety, even going as far as to include non-vegan options. Her original vision is now blurry and she might drive beyound the point of no return. The once unique pizza that she loved has morphed into a commonplace restaurant. Although she could still make a living, assuming she kept the average customer, still she struggles with the battle of commonness, not counting the fact she does not like to serve meat-based pizza. 

An even more extreme case is that of a pizza place offering an astounding 256 different pizza toppings, all derived from just eight ingredients. This case underscores the potential for a business to lose its essence in the pursuit of pleasing everyone. 

Sometimes, entrepreneurs resort to radical adaptations to stand out. A case in point is the trend of Brazilian pizza places offering sweet pizzas, a daring deviation from the norm, aiming to differentiate themselves. One of the early creations were about banana pizza with sugar, which some people may have been mad for a while but then in retrospect they are now happy as they see pizzas with mm toppings all over. Now the banana pizza is a blessing. And yet to conclude this section with the restaurant situation, consider the small pizza place that wants to follow the linear construction by listening to every single customer, if we name them by their needs - salt, salt plus, salt minus, pepper plus, pepper too much, I hate petter, more cheese, less cheese. Lucky would be the owner if they were expressing like that but in reality it comes like "there is too much pepper" exactly when the owner had tested a spicy pizza and gave it for free for the sake of feedback. In the end, after trying experiments and listening, his pizzas are average, tasteless, or as a friend would say "paintbrush water." Just as an aside, I was once walking by a plaza in Palo Alto and have seen an interesting booth like a futuristic tiny house made of metal pieces that looked like sun-powered panels. A person was in there and I asked what was that about. He said he was an artist taking photos of places of Palo Alto and his intent was to arrive at the average color of Palo Alto to which I said "you mean a green-grayish?" I don't recall how the conversation ended but I could see a possibility of an average color of a city to be something beautiful.  

#### Exercising from principles 

Commitments can also serve as a powerful counter-strategy to our automatic reactions. For instance, you want to introduce a new sandwich to your menu, but time constraints are a barrier. Announcing the product before its actual launch, or even pre-releasing it as a prototype, can impose a commitment.

Philosopher Robert Nozick's perspective, as explained by Professor Tamar Gendler, reinforces this approach. Gendler mentions Nozick in a lecture on "Weakness of Will and Procrastination," stating, "Principles, says Nozick, constitute a way of tying ourselves to the mast, not through external restraints like ropes, but through internal commitments to follow their mandates" (Gendler, 2012, 37:30). This concept is akin to deciding not to smoke a cigarette - an individual action signaling a broader commitment to health. In the context of our sandwich prototype, this represents a commitment to innovation and future growth.

In essence, you make a commitment where, in a way, you tactically "deceive" yourself to react differently from your standard behavior. By aligning your identity with a vision of the future and establishing a commitment to anticipated change, you foster a sense of stability, which can give you a chance to avoid automatic reactions. In the case of the sandwich prototype, this could help you when a first customer says the flavor is lacking; you could respond that the product is still in development and that the feedback given will be considered, in addition to offering apologies to the customer.

In conclusion, we know that our innate reaction can compel us to fix problems quickly - which is good. However, our quick and automatic reaction can also be paused and call for a moment of reflection - about our possible actions. Furthermore, we can justify activating strategic thinking that can pave the way for long-term solutions. By reflecting on our natural tendencies, we can initiate positive changes, leading us more quickly to a better future.





### Proteced by local-global representativeness 






For every venture, there's a outstanding necessity of groth, which is the idea that the product needs to be launched to a market, although the market may start like a prototype of what is the market, and then, if traction through the interacion with the market is shown, then a larger market is innevitable. But nevertheless these confrontations with the market ahead happen throught what some entrepreneurs call it a launch - others may call it an inauguration. But essentially, it's a projection, where these elements are in a way or another offered to elements, like customers, which gives feedbacks after a consumption of the offering. The feedback may happen in different ways, like actual qualitative feedback given, ratings, by the very premium paid, and more. 

The idea of launching unfinished products has become normal, with the understanding that there is no service or product that is pre-thought perfectly or that there is no product that survives contact with the customer without undergoing modifications, in the same way that there is no business plan that survives a first customer [^footnote_steve_businessplan_fail]. 

Additionally, situations of this highly interactive "launching process" are increasingly common, although less apparent in the offline world, but quite clear in the online world where teams launch their projects again and again to iterate, to improve, based on interactive experiences with the market or what they think is their market. That is, the process of reviewing and improving offerings as linked to the participation of the external environment, for example with the involvement of data from customers or from other sources to which they believe represents a truth that supports growth. 

[^footnote_steve_businessplan_fail]:

But that is easy to think if we are considering a sort of in-vitro experiment. The complication, however, lies in the trenches of execution where the notion of representativeness heuristics [^foonote_representativeness_james_green] is recognized as present, which is one way to describe the necessity where any startup team deals with a subjective reality which is a result of their need to validate hypothesis however through limited experiements that touches the external environment. In other words, they are essentially navigating the space to collect data that supports more investment, as in seeking patterns or signals that can guide decision-making. This situation makes representativeness to be both the problem and the solution, as the earlier the stages, the bets are higher which is to say that the signals being sought do represent support about directions more than the actual truths in the sense of validation. In other words, the "good data" in the beginning is essencially patterns which would lead a team to come up with more mature, or concrete, experiments where, as maturity grows across iterations, the data would then reveal closer to truths, where an actual live product being used reveals even closer. 

[^foonote_representativeness_james_green]: The element of representativeness, as refered by the professor James Green, in his work Opportunity Analysis Canvas (2015), is a characteristic or tendency of entrepreneurial behavior to trust what is heard and seen in the nearby domain - such as relying on previous knowledge, already known data, their own customers, friends, and the like. 

The complication out of this situation is exactly that the signals collected that support values - perceived as necessary or sought - create anchors, like a force that supports a direction which pulls a natural objection against new efforts where new experiments tend to be viewed of as of arbitrary; not entirely due to what was found represents truths but because the results in a direction are quite meaningful being that the offering is a not yet a well-done solution. In other other words, a half-way product in the right direction will win when compared with other less than half-way product in a direction yet to be tested. 

As an example, if a startup serves fresh vegetables to local customers, and if the team serves them well, there are ties with serving them well which may prevent the team to use time to serve existing or new customers in different ways, as the system can't generally embrace the new costs, or other complications such as to serving different groups of customers in different ways, serving new customers at the risk of serving poorly the group of current customers, and the like. 

Now, what is revealed by this exercise is a tension of the extremmes, between constructing linearly via aggregating in a sort of direction, which sets the team into all sorts of future problems such as when an underlying aspect has to be revisited, versus the the ideal non-linear concept of testing various offerings in front of different groups which can be generally considered when the team says "well, we can create cohorts," which is essencially a way to protect groups of customers. But the beauty in the theory, again, does not necessarity translate into solutions in the trenches of doing it, again because of the very points of urgency, of the feedback as valued by values, such as "if we make a new cohort, we might be using time which should be used to keep our customers happy." Therefore, noticing this tension as a complication, set us to seek solutions such as cases where teams are able to improve the richness of iterations in ways that supports their growth. 

In this regard, it is worth considering the case of Airbnb, which is real case where the process of launching several seemed possible. According to co-founder Brian Chesky (2015), Airbnb was launching their startup several times, as they communicated to bloggers who wrote about Airbnb organically - as in not paid - and this paved the way for more important publications, such as CNN or The New York Times, to eventually write about it. But the points of press, tough revealled by Brian, should not confuse us about the underlying process of learning that Airbnb team had the chance to get into, and more important which is a reflection about the conditions, or factors, that enabled Airbnb team to consistently navigate that space of protection such as to be free of the tension and likely liberating them to learn.  

> *"Oh man, so we're one of the companies that launched a bunch of times. I actually learned something, because we kept doing launches to get a lot of press: If you launch and no one notices, you can actually just keep launching. (laughter) And so, we just kept launching. Like, 'We've launched!' And people would keep writing about it, as if we launched. We're like, we'll just keep launching until we get customers. And we would change things and change the name, and we'd launch again. And so the first so-called launch was that first weekend, but that was just three people. The second launch was Air Beds and Conference United States. And we had two customers, I was one of them. And so we decided, we'll launch at least one more time. When I used it in South by Southwest, at the time, there was no payments and you had to stay in an airbed. And a bunch of people was telling me a bunch of things. They said, 'Why do I have to... like, I want to go to London, but there's no conference.' And we're like, 'Why does this have to be for conferences?' At the time, that wasn't even obvious. Why would anyone stay in anyone's home if there wasn't a conference? It would be too weird. And then we thought, 'Wait, why does it have to be on air beds?'"* (Chesky, 2015, 9:40-10:38)

The statement of Brian indicates indeed an ideal situation, from a product in development perspective, or the situation with that goes along with the saying that if tree falls in the forest and no one saw it, did it really fall? Therefore, the greater benefits of that stage didn't lie in the benefits of launching for the sake of launching, such as press for press or press for customers, but the revealed insight that learning from real experiences were happening through the multiple launches; which by the way goes along with the lean movement where experiments exist to bring about data that can help the team to improve the value proposition, the idea of ideal customes, and the like. 

Now, and quite important as we seek the conditions that allowed Airbnb to exercise that interaction with freedom, is the indication of the release of that tension when he said that "If you launch and no one notices, you can actually just keep launching." This is a powerful statement that in fact reveals that the team were free from prior valuation of feedback given, as in it resonates with the idea of freedom where the team feels good to testing out interactions in front of a completely new customers, and doing so whatever they tested could bring in learnings from the prior experiments and at the same time run the risk of testing new ideas with no further damage. In other words, it is possible to consider that the experiments associated with the conferences, at locations, gave them a good condition to engage with the benefits of doing one-time experiments, like an event. 

Now, of course and depending on the team culture, they were subject to running through conferences and aggregating features as in the extremme situation of summing up all the things customers loved which would indeed take them into a bad product or bloated system to maintain. Nevertheless, it can then be established, at least for the purpose of this reflection, the sistuation where the data from local interactions might provoke teams to consider that learning from local experiments leads to either add, or bundle, or subtract, or unbundle, based on listening, which essentially allows for revisiting aspects of the value proposition.

Now, and to support another factor of the team culture of Airbnb, it should be also acknowledged that Airbnb team had the opportunity to be mentored by thoughts of a protective nature, in the sense of liberating a team from pressures. In this regard, Brian recognized the role of the advisor Paul Graham [^footnote_paul_graham_presence] and his thoughts - and ideas related to the article "Do things that don't scale" - as a mentor-advisor that sucessfully promoted a principle which essentially allowed the team to go seek value from early interactions as opposed to focusing in the growth of numbers, like customers: 

[^footnote_paul_graham_presence]: Note that the role of Paul Graham had enabled access to viewpoints by principles given by his status, such as by his reputation, character, wisdom or his role in the top-tier venture capital and accelerator Y Combinator; which undeniably reveals that teams may be able to see through, or shock-absorb their inclinations, or as Paul Graham would call, instincts. 

> *"Probably the most important single piece of advice I got, which is probably advice that is probably the most important advice I can give you, or one of the most important advice, is he [Paul Graham] basically drew out this chart and he basically said, it's better to have 100 people that love you, 100 customers that love you, than a million customers that just sort of like you. In other words, if you have 100 people that absolutely love your product, they'll tell 100 people, and then they'll tell 100 people, or even 10 people, and this thing will grow. We call it growing virally."* (Chesky, 2015, 22:01-22:32)

The above statement of Brian reveals a tension, and the complication, as it apparently states that in order to grown the team shouldn't seek growth, which would sound as generic, romantic, or unrealistic; especially if the ideas are given out with no regard to context of Airbnb at the time. Part of this context is that the proposition of Airbnb initially consisted of offering stays for groups to share space for short stays around conferences at locations. By that, it is natural that the customers that attended conference X would not right away attend the next conference, which essentially would make it less troublesome for relaunching since a new launch with new terms were likely not directly impacting prio r customers, this enabling them to more properly test and learn from local experiments and to see transcendence of a product in terms of the pursuit for value essentials as opposed to summing up features by the ties with all the prior customers.  Another aspect of the situation of Airbnb that helps to the case of slowing down to search for special value has ties to what theme of viral growth indicated by Brian, which is that Airbnb essentially started as multisided marketplace, with house owners on one side and customers for the short-term stays on the other side and likewise very important to consider the phenomenon of the struggle of people to either accept anonymous people on their houses or on the other end the struggle of the traveller to enter a new unknown space with others which they didn't know in a house they didn't trust too. 

In other words, Airbnb weren't jumping from conference to conference acquiring users by the launches as in using marketing to advertise a service that was initially bundled and static, like a listing place with available houses for shared stays. They essence in doing things that don't scale, and launching and experimenting across locations essentially enabled them to learn with isolation, therefore enabling them to find the right interaction experience tuned to not only remove fears from both sides of the marketplace but making them happier - house owners and travellers. With this isolation, or freedom to experiment, they were essentially in a better position to growh the value first which took them into a safer position and more exposure leading to improving their market such as adapting the service to short term stays for travel in general such as what they explored with the stays in the city of New York. 

To close, for every local tests you do, your team will likely deal with the tension which rises from the consideration that, on one extremme what was leaned from a prior interaction, values given by feedback, might become apparent in the product to be tested in another locality. And the other extremme, if one could run the world with no regards to the use of resources or reputation, where the re-run of interaction experiments could be done again and again with totally different propositions up to the point of discovering value.  





### Protecting by leadership





Requires respect to the fact that things won't go so well as I am doing manually. 

The design phase of management is one particular aspect that goes along with execution, cause management doesn't see aspects of an entrepreneur effort as isolated. It is concerned with the past, present, and future. Because of this nature, the manager may find herself in a particular situation of leadership. This particular situation might recognize when a manager is critical in its role. 

When she manages the present and also the future and therefore feels as necessary - or using Peter Drucker terms, to be someone - and the same is the general perception of her peers. 

From this situation, it comes the possibility that she might need to leave, to be absent, such as to take time off. But vacation can't happen. With that, vacation never happens because the possibility of taking her out implies that things might go off track. That the state of health for the organization's future and present might be at risk. In other words, risk for anything planned for its future, plus stability for the situation of the present.

When she really faces the fact that the release of herself is likely necessary, therefore, comes the complication and work that consists of separating her roles, what she does for the present and future needs. From another perspective, it is an opportunity for her to "automate" her responsibilities or seek the traits that would make her, or the analytis of herself in autopilot, taken for granted. 

Therefore, it seems that part of what management does is really about automation which aims for producing change in the organization. Or, change that serves growth. 





#### Story of the dishwasher solution





I have written the following letter to editors of a publication

> *"Hi editors,  A draft for an article for your consideration - The Dishwasher Machine Management Problem. When I say consideration, I am not forcing anything. Just sharing. I know that this is simple, it might be more like an outline.  A lot of people in Brazil refuse to invest in a dishwasher. The reasoning is this: When I wash the dishes, I reflect; it's not that hard. If I get a machine, I have to buy new dishes, change my habit, accept that I have to organize everything perfectly inside, and even pre-clean the dishes. I get mad because it feels like I am working for the machine. And all this to gain, in total, 10 minutes instead of doing it by hand. Such reasoning makes lots of sense: The machine will do a job very poorly. That machine comes with a mediocre process that costs a lot - a dishwashing machine in Brazil costs 2-3 minimum wage salaries. Now the dishwasher machine problem is a problem of management. A team manager is tied to the routine, managing the system, accelerating, or pausing its components. Not much consideration is given to upgrading the process with " a new machine" such as a human resource. At this moment, many excuses will show up, just like the excuses that justify not incorporating that mediocre machine in the process. But that 10min gain, which received lots of no-go reasons, can be the opportunity for major gains. Consider when a manager adds an intern, for example: Yes, the dishes will need to be adapted, and it might offer a 10-minute, like that mediocre machine. But similarly to the opportunity of using that extra 10 minutes to do something useful in the kitchen, the manager - and its team - will be able to support that new working piece to improve its maturity. The difference between the dishwashing machine and your human resource is that the human resource wants to grow if you give her a chance. PS: Could connect with Andy Grove on Task Relevant Maturity "* (Marcio Galli, Letter to Raw Signal)



### Protected by readiness

But a strategic growth developer-coach, might see into the box, and unbundle, allowing growth, like p178-180 Julia Cameron indicates. Thus the management consideration could have to do with bundle to criticize and unbundle to allow development and growth. 9438988-4304093490-04304903-4928408 (lean, breaking auto reaction)

* Consider - ( ) Check Julia Cameron, p.180, the situstion for strenght vs. weaknesess - and the risk of a critic for a thing that is under development. The case of a writer that needs to do the craft but lacks to protect, via containment as specified by Julia Cameron, and then shows to a critic that is biased by market or other pressures and fails to be a growth-oriented, as shaped by schools and the culture according to her. 

* Consider ( ) Urgent vs. important reflection - As, of course, a natural objection to not deal with "what is important" rises from a pressure, like a critic framed by pressures, present values or needs, which results in "It gotta be very important, to be important" which naturally pushes us into not dealing with it, you lack compassion.

Where does it come from the idea that people have to find time for things, such as special projects? I have, a few years ago, in the sense of trying to challenged myself, fighting that idea as in saying "it does not work like that". And it seemed right but still I caught myself thinking about time and having time. But today, when reading Julia Cameron, I caught a new origin of bad ideas about "having to have time for things" She mentioned envy. That people may be envious of one another that seem to have time. HAve you see that idea? Any other idea which supports the myth of having time? JUlia Cameron brought the word victimization of time too. 

This idea of envy might open a good reflection that gives us a view about what seems to be a mature or a corporate version of the individual that is envy of the hypothetical other that has time. What fundamentally goes on with the "envy" is a comparison mechanism, which trigger us to compare with the "other entity" that has more resources and the right conditions, the investment, gas in the tank, you name it. 

Julia Cameron points the situation of "would be" writers that can't exercise the fundamental mechanism, they can't write. She asks them to make time, and as they do, that they might find themselves doing it, being able to allocate time. They are "opening" time against others, perhaps as a sense of safety increases. And for that, for writers, they need to nurture that condition, so that their strugle or need to be ready, readiness, is lessed.

* Abstract - The article "The Right Mood for Progress: Overcoming Paralysis by Analysis in Entrepreneurship" explores the natural inclination of individuals to gravitate towards tasks where they feel in control and the challenges they face when dealing with more complex activities in entrepreneurship. It highlights the fear of "paralysis by analysis," which can hinder decision-making and progress. Drawing from Julia Cameron's approach for writers, the article suggests an exercise involving self-reflection to overcome these barriers. By understanding their automatic tendencies and cultivating the right mindset, entrepreneurs can tackle demanding tasks with greater confidence and achieve success in their ventures.

## SCqA v0.2 

* SCqA - Situation - Analysis paralysis is a situation of when people justify stopping the analysis work and focus on what appears to be pragmatic, where learning can happen as things move, it is real as a device, has good intentions. 

* SCqA - Complication - The generalization of the possible action - of avoiding analysis - can become a device, a thought-tool, used in all sorts of circumstances. Not many talks about what comes before Analysis Paralysis, such as fear and control. 

* Different - This article takes a different approach to the concept of "analysis paralysis" compared to typical discussions. It recognizes the importance of being in the right mindset for progress and incorporates a writing exercise from Julia Cameron to foster self-reflection. By embracing this approach, entrepreneurs can overcome challenges more effectively and strike a balance between preparedness and action.

Some activities naturally pose a challenge to initiate. Imagine, as an entrepreneur, if you had to redesign your sales process, devise a new strategy, or reflect about the culture in the early stage of your start-up. These tasks often carry expectations and elicit strong emotions as our minds gear up for thoughtful analysis. Well, not really. If an activitity ahead is taken as not important, the natural reaction might be to ignore it in formal terms, quite strong, although of course a definite move firm after the feeling of certainty. 

Indeed, we naturally gravitate towards tasks where we feel we have a firm grip on the steering wheel. These are the activities where we're in control, where we can clearly see the road ahead and navigate the journey at our own pace. Yet, when it comes to other activities, such as challenging where how do to and results can't be measured, we might feel anxiety, or fear, or a sense that it won't progress. For that, we do have good reasons, such as the desire to be safe. We want to be prepared for these kinds of activities. The idea of progressing through planning and analysis isn't as straightforward as following a recipe even when it is labor-intensive. In other words, is more comfortable to run on the gas pedal when we don't have to review the road map or even the trip strategy. 

With this openning, it is not that we entirely give up doing things that requires redesign. It is just that we want to be in a good position, to be in the right mood, to be prepared, ready, and having things sorted out. This situation plagues all sorts of professionals, but especially the roles that involves leadership such as of entrepreneurs. 





### Search for reasons for timeless 






Furthermore, the notion of "analysis paralysis" frequently resonates in our minds, embodying the fear that we may become so wrapped up in overthinking and overanalyzing that we end up immobilized, incapable of making decisions or taking action. This fear can amplify our anxiety and the perceived necessity to be 'in the right mood' to tackle these demanding tasks. While the real situation of analysis paralysis can indeed be debilitating, the prevalence of this concept in discussions and self-reflections often heightens the apprehension about engaging with tasks that seem to be complex. It's essential to distinguish between the phenomenon that gave rise to the concept - of analysis paralysis - and the rhetorical device it has become, often used to accentuate the fears and which challenges the execution of important tasks. 

Conclusion? We need to be in the right position to advance, in a good mood, in a positive emotional state, and the readiness condition in general, that gives us more control towards the outcome. But to get out of this need that prevents us from advancing more complex reflections, and in the pursuit of a solution, it is need to emphasize the value, in the first place, of the exercise of reflection on this automatic tendency of ours. Furthermore, it is worth considering Julia Cameron's idea for the situation of writers - which can shed light for entrepreneurs. The exercise that Julia suggests consists of writing - for example for 10 minutes - about what is on your mind, some concern, for instance, a lack of preparation. From there, try to write for another 5 minutes about how your mood towards the activity has changed. She asks us to make a sort of report on the experience.

Research: Look for the specific part in "Maslow on Management" where Abraham Maslow compares and contrasts the mindsets of a controller and a creative individual. Understand the context and implications of this comparison.

Analysis: Analyze the tension between trying to control the outcome of potentially risky unknown tasks and the subsequent pull towards this mindset. Consider how this tension might lead to the anxiety, expectation, and need to "be in the mood" before initiating certain tasks.

Connection: Investigate how Maslow's work supports the concept of needing to be in a certain mindset or mood to tackle challenging tasks. Draw connections between his theories and the ideas presented in your writing.

Not unlike, it also happens in the life of writers, as illustrated by Julia Cameron (1998) in 'The Right to Write'. It is a phenomenon that plagues all sorts of professionals, especially those in leadership or entrepreneurial roles.

As interpersonal relationship arises, feedback systems chimes in. We gotta be driven by and free of. And going back to values of higher-order goals, going back to values of a system that gives people opportunity to grow, are important aspects to nurture time for. Thus, it is the responsibility of the entrepreneur and the executive team to deal with this, to use time for this, mapping, unbundling, being a critic and being a growth mentor, giving permission too, openning protective spaces of bets and separating risk analysis. 

As an aside of the phenomenon, I ask us to go back to that extremme situation pointed: how easy it is to get approved anything that supports values, such as the values that we have captured and perceived, and conversely how difficult we make for strategic ideas to get in our way. I will close with the situation of writers: If I happen to become good in writing in English, as in grammatically correct, I might value that to a point that wouldn't allow myself to write poorly in terms of grammar. But what if writing poorly, or more freely, were the closest path to finding something beautiful and meaningful. To close, entrepreneurship is like writing.
