# Feedback of urgency

--> 

At any time, a sense of urgency can take the attention of the startup team; which is generally not too bad, as to work in what is urgent comes with a direction, even if it is so to maintain some equilibrium, to sustain a value. But it is also the case that teams - under the consideration of their future - can be concerned that focusing on what is urgent could can put the future at risk. Let us reflect about the things that changes, as the startup advances, and how feedback interferes with how the team prioritizes their activities, such as to get stuck with urgent and non-important activites. 

It comes a day when the team is concerned that some important work is not being done as the team is too busy. This discussion can be explored using the Eisenhower matrix [^footnote_matrix_important_vs_urgent], where the urgent axis intersects with the important axis, resulting in four quadrants: urgent and important, urgent and non-important, non-urgent but important, and non-urgent non-important. Should this matrix appear or not, the core of the discussion has to do with questions such as "why the urgent work is really urgent?" or "why we aren't we working more on the other things that could change our situation to better?" 

[^footnote_matrix_important_vs_urgent]: 

The discussion shows that something has changed and that new planning is in order because something might be wrong. To illustrate, consider the team that has started with stratetic work, such as the work of discovery of their initial customers. As they found a couple of potential customers, a new reality emerged as they started valuing their customers. In a way, they understood themselves as having achieved maturity, that they had to be responsible to these new customers, such as to keep them happy even if the work to keep that is not too fun. But the new activities also started to affect their time and impacted other discussions such as new strategies that could set team in a new direction, or a better future, such as to consider if these current customers should be left behind so that they could focus on other customers. 

When this discussion happens, if it happens, it might be because the team has reached a saturation point. A wise team would indeed respect that a prior move of important and non-urgent activities brought them customers. Conversely, and as much as they feel overwhelmed, they now value the need to attend their customers and they fear losing these customers. In other words, losing those customers does has double weight - as these customers are considered important and leaving them behind would mean being careless for the investment of the high-risk and non-urgent but important work that brought the customers in the first place. 

Now, and in the said saturated situation, if a team member raises a hand and points that the new customers are bringing problems that is keeping the team from working on other important things, a natural response from a "strategic manager" will say that "this a problem we wanted to have." This line of reply has a power to silence the concern and it also welcomes these good new problems. These are now acceptable urgent matters likely considered urgent and important. What is complicated is the reflection that almost takes place by short lifecycle of that lonely hand. In other words, there's someone that notices that the team had indeed started with a kind of work where strategic activities took place first but by the new numbers, e.g. the count of customers, she is now frustrated that the team is busy and they seem to be okay with the urgencies while she fears that their end having ties with the numbers now justifies them to get too busy into the means. She sees the team as a victim of its present reality. This person might be in a way contrarian to what the team is doing - perhaps not so excited anyway - as she sees their focus on what is urgent as a problem.

@meta @outline
* outline - question - what can we do to see ways to break urgency and be safe into strategic thinking again?
--> 




In perspective, as one or many urgent activities sets in, they are indeed supported by values. And now, any new input with ideas to change the course is now to be compared with the new equilibrium that now needs to be maintained. In other words, the team justifies to stick with what's urgent. Of course, and naturally, as otherwise, they'll be busy trying to go back to the beginnings again. And for them, that means jeopardizing the equilibrium that they have secured in the first place. Nothing can be done unless one really moves beyond frustration and proves the new effort - with data - or if they prove themselves they have failed. Unfortunatelly, in the real world, none of these extremmes happens so fast; which brings us to the question, and the openning to the reflection that follows, which is as natural as why is it that we can't work anymore in the strategic and important things that could save us from being too busy with these urgent things? And what can we do to help us get out from the urgencies that can kill strategic thinking and reflection? 

The first analysis that follows the temporal analysis that naturally rises, the story of a reality that started with the initial movement in the past, consisting of high-risk movements of investment, and recognizes that as work started the team naturally gravitated from important not urgent to what they thought as important and urgent but in addition from their success and involvement of the team, a new future was created, bringing up more urgent things to be real, such as unexpected ones, and with that new challenges, such as to the point of mobilizing the team into work within them and also to into the affairs to challenge the new ideas that can be perceived as of a high-risk nature. The second aspect looks at the elements of feedback that the team takes in consideration - consciously or not - that happens to set the role of a critic that generally has the power to put the label of urgent to activities, at the rise of the monitoring for these urgent activities, at the valuation of this feedback which go much as to make a team set the bar too high for new proposals such as if one says "it gotta be very important!"  


<!-- 
@meta @note - #compassion #aspect2

Another exercise of reflection, which also follows we will be recognizing success as an allocation of resources which is urgent, thus the means that we make urgent to be urgent, the reflection that feedback systems are present, and the critic or measurment system that makes things appears as critical. As much as attempting to talk about the future seems arbitrary, or a risky idea, even more risky is the actual fact that pushes many to do the things as urgent completely driven by a critic that sets them in the actual not have perspectives, such as driven by values, by principles, and undeniably deniying important things, and raising the bar too much for what is impotarnt, as in lacking compassion.

## The rise of the urgent 






Now things can get complicated that the feedback that tell us that urgent is urgent such as "that customer isn't/is happy" come to us by the means of the very system that created in the first place to read the feedback. In other words, the food truck cart gets in the way while the customer is hungry which affects the whole experiment. More generally, we can trapped in our world the more we develop it. 

An illustration is required so think of a company of the early 2000s that had set up an electronic system to monitor the satisfaction of their customers. So one day a customer tried to indicate her satisfaction but the interaction with the system failed because of a problem in the user interface. The team had a significant number of feedback systems in place so they were able to monitor that the feedback didn't appear. With that, the team had engaged into what they consider an expected work, to bring back the feedback system which by the eyes of anyone looking the situation it appears to be the only way for customers to interact. I mean, to inform how satisfied they are. 

To be fair, under the perspective of the growth situation of startups, the team needs to keep up the system up and running because they value it as the solution by which their customers can voice their opinion. So, they don't need to justify the work under the assumption that it is a critical system. Therefore, it is acceptable and expected and urgent for them to to engage because of that and other reasons such as that the team have been working on that for a while. Needless to say that the startup context recruits the best that see themselves as true fighters and not in a foolish game. In other words, if you watch their very motion, you will spot their "don't think just do" mentality. 

<!--

* Movie - TopGun - "Don't think just do" is what Maverick says and also the Take My Breath Away songs starts with "Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game" 
--> 

With that, it is fair to assume that none of that will bring about the subject - of "urgent vs. important" or more specifically the idea that the urgent things are taking our creative energy from the important things - unless the seeds of what we planted start to produce really undesired fruits or to attract bugs that can't be controlled. Still, it exists the possibility - and that is a reason to honor this complicated intrusion of new urgent things - for us to be involved in that ourselves, or witnessing teams, taking care of these matters such as killing bugs, managing the unexpected fruits, fixing and improving the irrigation systems, and moreover talking or being concerned with the new processes that rises to solve the urgencies so that we can keep the equilibrium of the whole system which appears to be bundled or that is perceived as promising. In other words, we not only work to keep stability for the things we value but also to mitigate the potential explosion of problems from the maintenance of that stability that would otherwise jeopardize the work. 

As an aside, this accounting and management around rising problems, or a management of maintenance, can be so well-done by teams that they happen to come up with innovations such as to maintain systems up, solutions for killing bugs, among other communication processes. In other words, we should keep our minds open to the beauty and the dangers of solutions [^editornote_glitch_story] that rises from our needs to keep an equilibrium in any given process. 

[^editornote_glitch_story]: Solutions to manage the management problem is not necessarily a problem as it has to do with that teams actually do. As an example, the death of a game company called Glitch became the formation of one of the world's most popular digital communication tool for teams, Slack. According to Cnet (2013), the communication tool was created to support the development of the game.

### The formation of a parallel reality 





With an idea for how far we can go, let us go back to a less complex situation of an entrepreneur and how the urgent things come our ways later. We should first acknowledge the nature of a startup where in the beginning there is nothing. So they move from nothing much to an action much before what takes them to discuss if things are urgent and how urgent things can impact important activities. In other words, an uncertain ideal took a doer to do when nothing seemed to be so urgent except a drive to drive, but then they do, and as they do, some situation of saturation seems to be evident to the point where they start to consider that they might need a perspective, such as to change something about how things are being done. 

To illustrate how urgent situations rise naturally, let us set our time machine to the old American West around the end of the 1800s and observe the life of a scientist who became a blacksmith interested in selling horseshoes. After setting up his store, and advertising locally, ge started to get his first customers. The customer would bring their horses, he sold and installed the horseshoes, and the customer moved on to do the job to be done. Everything was working as expected until one day a customer came walking and frustated and claiming that his horse died after the fact that the hourseshoe broke. Instinctively, the blacksmith felt compelled to restore the equilibrium and to repair the horseshoe was was caught in an unexpected situation since the customer wasn't happy and had no horse no horseshoe and only accompained by Smith & Wesson [^foonote_smithwesson]. What matters in the illustration is not the end but the automatic response from the blacksmith, possibly rooted in the principle of loss aversion [^footnote_loss_aversion], a concept that behavioral economics developed to help many of us to better understand the idea that the pain of loss is felt more acutely than the pleasure of equivalent gains. That part of the equation was something the blacksmith understood by his present reality without the need to see the future and read any scientific paper. 

[^foonote_smithwesson]: Naturally, it is expected from the illustration of a mad customer in the wild west that he had a gun. Smith & Wesson is a well known manufacturer of fire weapons founded in 1852 according to Wikipedia. https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson

Thus, it is fair to think that restoring equilibrium is merely a normal business reaction, clearing the way to keep things running smoothly and focusing on the tasks at hand.

* outline - Answer - k1.2 - We are already into the affairs with different realities, but now comparing them  
--> 






Now, and leaving the illustration in the past but keeping the essentials, we can then recognize that this new equilibrium that is needed to be maintained is a different present from what he originally expected. Thus, it is a parallel reality. If one had the time to reflect, to ask questions, one would arrive at the conclusion that he or she had indeed imagined a different outcome - such as of happy customers coming in and out not frustrated or drunk or mad, for example. But this is now - good or bad - the real present for that entrepreneur.

Now and as introduced before, it may be so that one brings up an idea for changing things of this present. It may be so with an specific idea but all of us living the pressure of the present would react accordingly to that and to a provocation that goes along with that, as if that one had in first place asked more time of everyone - the time to consider important activities. It maybe so then that a response of objection naturally rises. It may go as simple as "we don't have time for that" but also it may come with additional sayings such as "can you prove that if we do that it will take us out of this situation which you claim to be bad?" 

This need for proofs, or assurances, is not generallty seen as a bad thing from the viewpoint of the folks that protect the values given in the first place - such as the customers. There is logic in there. But what confuses the frustrated lonely troublemaker is how simple the objections from the team sets in - that the objections land so smooth and it seems even arbitrary; while his attempt to take off his plans are scrutinized with new demands, and proofs, or needs not only a whole blueprint but a coherent proof that is short, like an elevator pitch first. Thus the troublemaker becomes frustrated for the team has such a power to kill the beginning of new plans and moreover the chances for reflections to exist. 

Now, from a mature managerial pespective, all of this makes sense, doesn't it? The troublemaker could be generally a troublemaker. And the team could go all the way to investigate their style, their character, their identity, such as to prove that he or she didn't want really to help the team and wants to be against everything. But that can be an inacurate reading of a real work situation. It is likely to assume that these gatekeepers of value and traction now demand proofs because, in other words, the nature of the situation has changed. Because the new nature brought clarity.

### Our future is whatever we make it

-->


Now if the troublemaker is in troube in the face of the team for trying to point his finger to their bad use of time with urgencies, his main frustration is really due with the comparison mechanism that appears smoothly brutal - the comparison mechanism that is intuitively used by the team when they balance things out where on one hand they put present value - where the value can't be taken away - and on the other they don't even bother to put the idea but to leave there many questions in the place, asking for a good pitch, good reasons, a good plan, and also assurances. 

Of course, the troublemaker understands that her team's logic is supported by the principled logic of loss aversion and that her case at this point appears as a motivation, or even a provocation, as a potential objection, an intuition. With that said, the troublemaker has partial case to move forward exactly because the team's objection appear to like simple demands that can be considered as well naive, or even romantic, as if they wanted her to take a time machine to visit the future and come back with an almanac full of calendars, weather forecasts, statistical data, the whole proof.

The solution, or the lighting strike, that can turn this trouble maker into the one that can fix the future, lies the recognition of the fragility of the present as given by the situation. If the team makes demands for forecasting, forecasting the future is indeed a point to be taken seriously. And if the team is suddenly in a present that wasn't planned by them - the good problem that everyone wants to have as they claim - it is so because of unseen planning or poor forecasting that they got involved with. So if all that is seen in the present is a a quite vulnerable situation, it is then a permission for this concerned citizen to embrace the the parallel realities of the future. 

In this direction, in wearing the shoes of the troublemaker, and in the hope that we can fix the future from the urgencies of the present, let us ride with Andy Grove (1983) and follow along with a planning work that is far from a controller work and more inline with an ordinary activity that "it's something all of us do all the time with no fanfare, in both our personal and professional lives." Andy also gave us a window into our ability to do that:

By comparing in your mind the gas you need with the gas you have, you decice whether you should stop for gas or not."* (Grove, 1983, p.102)

--> 



That simple illustration from Andy Grove reveals key elements that he's concerned with in *High Output Management* (1983), such as that one that is driving or concerned with a unit of work, has to look at the situation as if it is a box, with inputs and outputs  In the case of the car, the output would be the goal, the destination, and the input the various elements that makes that destination possible, such as the gas, the car itself, the driver, the driver's state of wellness, among other elements. Conversely, any working unit where there is a team, is likely aimed at a destination - to bring about results - and that is the output of the "black box;" and on the other hand, the input involves people, their well-being, the methods and tools being used, financial resources, among other elements. 

Lookinf from that perspective becomes the reference work to for us to consider potential future realities, the impact, and possible new decisions. According to "Planning: Today's Actions for Tomorrow's Output" (1983, p.102), the forecasting framework can start first with the where we want to go in the future, then our present status, our conditions of our team's working box such as what it takes for us to drive and get there, and then we consider the things being done, the analysis of the outputs and results produced, given by the inputs being used, such as resources, and this essentially becomes a gap analysis, or how to close the gap, which can help teams to come up with solutions to get there.

Now and returning to the specific context, we know that the work here is not that the doer is interested in new planning for that working unit or factory, nor the worker was called to fix and find important things to do. The base of this work is this worker's concern with some new work that is now assumed to be urgent. With that said, the essence is the same and the managerial work consists of the same that anyone can do for improving any future. 

But since the team currrent beliefs are solid that the urgent is urgent, the forecasting work can consider three realitie: One is the ideal future or forecasted future that the team expects. The second is the actual future reality where this concerned citizen is concerned with, which is basically forecasting potential trouble from the current present situation with urgencies. And then  third would be the actual strategic propositions to reconciliate one future that is better.

Moreover, this concerned citizens now involved with a set of activities that are less to do with the actual roadmap and alignment with the idea of where we're going with the meat roads. It's basically to navigate the working unit, looking for the signals and information and trying to understand the quantitative and qualitative work that goes on before any suggestions.

A key insight from Andy Grove is the perspective where this concerned citizen is basically looking using partially objective and partially subjective means and it's interesting rating the quality of work that will help to make the projections and she can do that by looking for these indicators they are essentially the feedback points and the information are the essential factors but are the pieces of information from what happens where from that reference point the alternate realities will and can be developed furthermore can be extended such as to include other indicators they're not yet such as the counter effects they're happening or costs that people couldn't see and again all of that will make sense when projected in the future because the present people really believe that's all okay

To give an example of improved perspectives, consider the situation of the floor cleaned in a small space, as measured by a key indicator as the number of square feet cleaned. In this scenario, generally monitoring quality might be just about measuring the numbers. While the situation of a grown-up space, with thousands of square feet to be cleaned, would justify the need for a new indicator that "should be paired with a partially objective/partially subjective rating of the quality of work as assessed by a senior manager with an office in that building" (Grove, 1983, p. 17).

<!--
@meta @outline
* outline - Answer - k1.5 - Celebration of the subjective and objective reflection and preparing to dig in value 
--> 







The point of wisdom from Andy Grove, which is given by the identification of new pairing indicators, not only help us to build a clear notion that single indicator is not enough; as it supports the forward movement with the idea that the planning effort depends on the subjective and objective analysis that consists of a qualitative reflection which can be indeed projected based in the forecasting based on quantitative aspects. In other words, it becomes clear that situation of urgency is then formed with the intrusion of unexpected work - that rises from scaling and the growing condition - but that gets justified by a indicators that are too strong that obfuscates and confuses the team, under the sight of the values and objectives as desired. This happens because the new work wasn't yet analysed under the more rigorous analysis of impact. Or in other words, the team might be short circuiting as in to moving on whatever the means with an end in mind, which as we know may generallty be a idea that is accepted althought by its easy acceptance it is also the door that invites more trouble. 

With that said, what is configured now is a setting that a team yet sticks with a number of indications, through specific and other indirect feedback systems, but yet they hold on to the new work while new unexpected elements, and their indicators, are operating under the radar. This awareness is key for any analysis of impact but is also is an opportunity for us to reflect about the power of feedback systems and how a lot of feedback that sustains what we do is tied to value systems; which is where we are going next.

* outline - Answer - k2 - Escavating beyond political affairs, searching values   
--> 

## Accessing and assessing values 





Now if one wanted to get involved with this work of forecasting, such as to provoke the team to give up some urgent activities, that should involve the effort of getting buy-in, and the agreement, from the team; to get involved with the matter, which is quite complicated because they are quite involved in the present matters by the logic that we had considered before.

Therefore, the troublemarker shall then embrace the leadership position in order to move on and that involves to have the buy-in from the team, at a minimal level to support his involvement with this planning exercise. To to that, some ideas for an objective approach involves first to have a clear communication, to understand what everyone is doing in the present, and that involves the aspects of transparency. The other component is to understand the goals of everyone in the team because then you know what they are actually doing in connection with where they claim to be moving. As you know, these two aspects cannot give you exactly where they're gonna go in the future, and the consequences they might be involved with like the urgent affairs in everyone's job. That is why you need to go further by using these questions as a door to access and assess the values that justifies how they move and work on their goals. This is essentially a work of escavation - for the things that they hold on to when they hold the strong position that justifies how they work, what they do. These values can be associated with their objectives or other high-order goals or aspirations things that they fear and don't want to miss and that keeps them doing what they do and makes them to justify the positions they take. 

In 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey concerned with how people organize themselves around priorities had asked groups about thier major struggle. He was surprised that people blamed their lack of discipline. Stephen's deeper thought is that they are generally wrong about that and that their "[..] basic problem is that their priorities have not become deeply planted in their hearts and minds" because they haven't internalized that they need to *Begin with an end in mind*: 

> *"There are many people who recognize the value of Quadrant II activities [Not urgent and important activities] in their lives, whether they identify them as such or not. And they attempt to give priority to those activities and integrate them into their lives through self-discipline alone. But without a principle center and a personal mission statement, they don't have the necessary foundation to sustain their efforts. They are working on the leaves, on the attitudes and the behaviors of discipline, without even thinking to examine the roots, the basic paradigms from which their natural attitudes and behaviors flow."* (Covey, Stephen., 1989, p.158) 

In other words, and following along with Stephen, we should consider that the priorization that people hold - especially for the things of the urgent nature that weren't there in the first place - likely follows the same logic that there are other things in the roots, like paradigms, or values, such as values that sustain the arguments that they bring to the table. While it appears to be a work of a political nature, the serious planning work of forecasting - of alternative future realities - becomes part forensic because of an escavation work that starts with what is real and observable but does deeper into the arguments of people and the underlying values supporting their arguments. I say forensic now because we know that values are things people stick with and can be stronger than the objective realities too, can bring real impact to our futures. 

With that said, let us explore how we value feedback that grows from the entrepreneurial work activitity from the beginning and their future, and within how the feedback that grows with the growth is valued to a point of making us to develop strong positions. 





<!--

--> 

### Early valuation of feedback 





Now, the considerations for different realities, and the exercises that help with the discovery of potential indicators, such as the ones to counter-effect others indeed brings light and may help us to see some strategic new indicators. However, there are yet other inherent elements that gives meaning to these indicators that we may bring into our radar system of feedback. The complex is monitoring anything new is that the monitoring of it carries meaning, it adds value to a certain point of view. And it does that because there are values under it. In other words, when a radar spots a new and unknown aircraft is the space and if they happen to see that as an enemy, then they do so because their whole radar is influenced by values. 

Thus the real challenge if we return to the entrepreneurial situation that is conditioned to what is urgent, a difficult management job has to do with what happens in the space of feedback, more specificially with the perceptions that team holds as they measure things, and how values that they hold on influences a lot of that. 

Now, to recap our trajectory, it is fair to assume a situation of a team that justifies their urgencies with a current feedback system that is outstanding. Thus what makes urgent to be urgent seems quite strong, although it can be subjective. In addition our assumed situation and concern is of a situation of saturation that may go all the way to maintain a objective aversion to any new idea, or to set clear demands searching for objective assurances, for anything that challenges the estability of what is urgent. In other words, the paradox lies if we envision the extremmes: how easy it is to get approved activites that seem to support urgent vs. how difficult it is to get approved new important non-urgent category. 

Now, and before the reflection that follows, we have to celebrate feedback in the first place. Let us do it. We need to embrace the natural gift of our human operating system and our evolution. This is the thing that we use to monitor what happens, to feel what happens, the thing that help us to improve the narratives of our lives. In other words, we should acknowledge that we don't get into the affairs of monitoring the things we monitor for the sake of being in the same place, static. If we do it it is because we are driven by values or that we use values as reference points so that we can climb up the pyramid of life. In the end of the day, the end has a sort of good intention since we just generally want to be safe so that we can mess up with risky activities that may provide reward - all of that to take place before we mess up with transcendence, growth, success, happiness, and the like. 

Thus, if we were programmed to value valuable things, we do so that we can continue to invest. Like good friends, we value, we keep them around, and with them around, we hope to feel in better condition to move on and improve our lives. And to tease us in what is ahead, as you well expect, it needless to elaborate much that we do pick the wrong kind of friends for feedback under conditions where we don't have a wider view, a mature view. Therefore, an exploration of navigating feedback with family is friends is first given for the sake of our reflection on how feedback shows strong ties with values and the logic we use to navigate growth, a logic that sometimes misses the view from above. Then, we move on advancing with other situations of growth of teams, establishing a perspective for how the presence of vibrant feeback, in the sense of present, becomes valuated by teams in the face of perceived present values that are assumed to be values that enables further growth. All these reflections are here so that we can gain a point of view, in perspective, about how strong we give value to feedback, and possible misinterpretations such as how we allow a strong feedback to transcend and set signals out of the our radar, that either lies or are strong enough to not even allow us to seek to see through, to transcend, to reflect and interpret the real values we seen, then to life potential activities that can be more strategic.

Let us start with a phenomenon where entrepreneurs seek feedback from family and friends. Although it may not directly explain how teams use feedback to define what is urgent, or what they should do, it is a good starting point for the reflection about how feedback has ties with values. 

It is quite common, as entrepreneurs and teams begin their efforts, to exist interactions of seeking feedback from close networks such as seeking feedback from family and friends. It could be that, by doing so, a team is actually exercising navigating by feedback more than actually trying to pull precise truths such as if they are on the right track. But being for one or another reason, it is real that it happens such as in the beginnings where they are more lonely [^footnote_sam_altman_entrepreneurs_lonely], when local network inteaction happens to characterize them trying to reach higher networks of support that supports growth. 

[^footnote_sam_altman_entrepreneurs_lonely]:

As for the feedback by friends and friends, one topic that is a concern from experienced entrepreneurs is honesty. The difficulty with seeking feedback at this stage starts with the fact that the entrepreneur, project or team, wants to achieve success in the future. So this need, if not an urgency, sets a dilemma as any feedback for the the reality of now is likely to mess up with the opportunity and the future yet to be constructed. In other words, arbitrariness and risk is high and that can also be a reason for many to not seek or to seek - but the point is the awareness of the interaction in it. 

Therefore, talking about family and friends is acceptable, as these folks happen to be reachable, they are in the same nest so we can't do much to escape the situation we came from. I think that in a way we know that we are siloed - in our own nest or bubbles - and we also sense that our networks of reach seem to be useless in the sense of lacking the diversity [^footnote_burt_socialnetworks] that we seek under the vision we have. With that, it is fair to think that the interaction with the people we share values - or that cares about us - is a very proof that we actually are seeking subjectiveness through the interactions and perhaps an opportunity to transcend from the impossibility ahead. An friend of an entrepreneur, for example, not only accepts the half-way idea presented but does so under the viewpoint that the direction matters more which makes the discussion valid in the face of values, so that appropriate feedback is given so that the entrepreneur can be saved from trouble. 

[^footnote_burt_socialnetworks]: In "Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition," Ronald S. Burt challenges us to consider that we may develop our network but often develop redundancy, connecting with individuals who provide similar information or benefits. He provides an enlightened view that a strong network lies not in its size but in the diversity of connections.

The same happens with family, depending on the family culture, as the received feedback might not be honest because the person wants to motivate, or in other extremme demotivate. In other words, these folks are not free from the dilemma - where opportunity and risks are compared with the a path that is taken as of certaintly. In other words, through what appears to be an exercise of feedback, it happens to be discussions about investments that takes towards positive or negative values. Entrepreneur Adora Cheung went all the way to explore the topic through a viewpoint referred as "The Honesty Curve" (How to Start a Startup, 2014, 21:18), indicating that there are people who will lie. Let's look her example of a possible curve. On the vertical axis, she shows honesty level while on the horizontal axis, different kinds of relationships starting with the mother, then friends, then people.

<!--
@meta @todo
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In The Feedback of Urgency - Consider to bring back the image from Adora - honesty curve - perhaps not to the text but to reflect on it and to explain it better - ![Curva da honestidade](images/adora/honesty.png) - @meta-refid 8585-9393-9294-4848 
--> 

Adora presents two curves showing the level of honesty in the feedback given by different types of people. First, let's look at an offering that is not free showed by the red curve, for example, a paid product. In this case, according to Adora, a mother is likely to be less honest. As she move towards friends, she considers that honesty improves. She concludes that, for paid products, the further you go towards anonymous people, the more honesty you will see.

Then one might say — ah, but my mother is straightforward - and all my friends are honest with me. The problem is really knowing the perspective that each person had at the time of giving the feedback. What they wanted when they were giving the feedback. It may be that person X would change their view precisely because they have a degree of friendship with you and want the best for you. 

But what could we learn from this? that you cannot launch your snack cart by following the advice of your mother and family members? In fact it matters more the abstraction that their feedback has to be driven by values. And even more that  the situation of seeking feedback from friends necessarilly accepts values to get in the way as, again, without that acceptance it would be too early to be driven by data-driven feedback that could kill the whole effort in the first place. 

And in that regard, matters too the need to improve the awareness about the forms that feedback is shaped by these underlying values that gets in the way. The map of Adora, as an example, explores the honesty level the more you move towards anonymous people, in other words, the feedback given varies by the nature of the values being considered and the more we move to the right side, with more concrete experiments, the move precise data we find that are linked - objectively or subjectively - to values that are taken as good to move growth forward.

In the following illustration, consider the insights provided by Brian Chesky, the co-founder of Airbnb, in the interview by Reid Hoffman, as he sets the context and explores the beginning and initial conversation with his family, where it is clear that the entrepreneurial team is struggling by the conversation with the families and trying to transcend and to face the challenging situation where they have to identify basically the conflict with the values that they have, how they were brought into, in contrast with the different values of a potential vision. Therefore, they are trying to break their assumptions.

> *"My parents are both social workers. My mom used to have a joke. She said, 'I chose a job for the love, and I made no money, so you should choose a job for the money.' And I said, 'Well, I'm going to art school.' And she said, 'Oh my God. You chose the only path in life that's gonna pay less than a social worker because you're gonna be an artist and get paid nothing.' And so she said, 'If you do that, make sure you don't move back home, live in my basement. Make sure that you get a job one day and that if you get that job, make sure that job has health insurance.' And this was like a grand ambition for my parents. So, it wasn't about starting any kind of big company, or scaling up a company. And so I wasn't going to be able to call my parents, 'Oh my God, what do I do? I have 100 employees, how do I scale?' That wasn't going to happen in my family."* (Chesky, 2015, 1:54)

These kinds of conversations are not uncommon in the lives of many entrepreneurs and likewise when they continue their path and transcend and access new values it's equally possible to identify their certain level of conversation about the new values and the conflicts that they're challenging continue to go on at that same level:

> *"Of course, my mom said, 'You're actually unemployed.' I said, 'No, I'm actually an entrepreneur.' And that's also when I learned, when you're starting out, the difference between unemployed and being an entrepreneur is in your head. It's usually a mindset. And I was, in my head, an entrepreneur. And they said, 'Well, what are you entrepreneuring?' And I'm like, 'cause it wasn't really a common word there, and I said, 'Well, I got this thing, Air Bed and Breakfast.' They're like, 'Air Bed and what?' And we just started to get used to pitching it. We're like, 'Maybe we should actually do this.' And, it was still not obvious. The original idea was airbeds for conferences."* (Chesky, 2015, 7:36)

To contextualize, we're driving to the right side, towards growth. Thus, we hope that there is more truth as we navigate further. We hope that we are leaving this "less honest" values or "too strong" values that may get in the way of the vision. Our hope is that the feedback ahead is more precise, or truthful, to the business or the vision. 

With that said, we do also have to acknowledge that the movement ahead will just add more eyes, or experiences, or viewpoints, to the organization that gets formed; thus that under the possibility of growth, a the implied potential of higher impact such as with more people more investment more resources more certainty, we might be essentially navigating a risk analysis. With that the feedback is expected to come from interactions that are more significant - or more in tune with the data is expected to be stronger - or more representative, or to be meaningful in the sense of revealing signs that may support our further bets, to fail less.

#### Transitions 






Still, if the analysis is intended to move away from the experienced situation of a higher degree of subjectiveness, such as given by the prior section, yet we should be concerned that there is always a degree of subjectiveness that appears to be objective or quite strong exactly because the nature of values changes the move we navigate towards growth and maturity. In other words, we do find mature personalities, or strongser views, which are intended to help us to grow. 

Now imagine an experienced and successful psychologist who uses a time machine to visit herself fifteen years ago, on the first day a client was late. Today, her clients are rarely late, as they are, let's say, well-trained. But as she went back, the she of the present is astonished to see that her past self had greeted that late client with a big smile and even a hug. She thinks now, "Wow, did I use to hug my patients?" Indeed, she seemed to have celebrated their late arrival, as in reassuring to a friend that everything was okay, as if they were brothers. It is now clear that the psychologist from the past was happy, as if she was supporting the client's tardiness, not for the sake of being late, but as a sort of ethical protocol of compassion.

Moving forward after looking back, she wonders if she wanted to look nice, as in if that behavior was a form of protection linked her insecurities as she feared to lose the client. She also remembers the context, when she had five patients, when she was quite happy to have five patients. That plus the fact that she was genuinely helping that late person, that she cared about them. Today, she has 50 patients and most of them are on time, as she knows that allowing them to attend their sessions late bring problems for themselves and also for her entire work situation. In other words, she's seems to be more conscious about her whole business, which goes with a degree of confusion because, one the other hand, she still feels a bit sad that she now makes tough decision such as to give up on patients that don't show up consecutively.

The passage might shows the complex situations that professionals face. As they advance in maturity through the entrepreneurial path of growth, their value systems also shifts such as from the values they held to - as trained as specialists such as the case of a psychologist - now embracing entrepreneurial values or generalist values to hold the organization standing. In other words, the psychologist of the past had strong beliefs that the core element of her practice, to which the possibility of growth would happen, heavily lied in the doing good, to be compassionate. This idea could even push further the professional to take longer to see the growth problems of the same behaviors or to - as indicated in the introduction - to move on with these values and then face eventually the sum of problems and to see them as "good problems to have." 

As a side note, in this area, it seems to me that many doctors actually do not face the struggle in first person as they hire others to do the "dirty work" such as to ask customers to pay on time. ANother side now is the recognition that if one wanted to wait to deal with the problem - such as to wait for something like like 25-50 clients - they are in a way or another entering that exercise of forecasting although not embracing it as true managers.

##### Transcending using values towards vision 





In this direction, the exercise of consciousness can evaluate the values that are assumed to be vital to keep things as they are. In other words, when we connect values with the things we think are feeding this values, we may better achieve clarity about other things we can do that in fact may feed the same values of other underlying values which are even more important. As an illustration tied to the given example, the professional had understood, through a conscious exercise, that accepting patients late in a consistent matter seemed to be about making them happy, about embracing them with compassion, but the consciousness evaluation and reflective exercise had enabled the professional to not only see that such allowance was doing harm more than good, but a whole well-written justificative that had turned out to be a great explanation for the patient on why to try to be on time. After the psychologist had implemented the explanation, she had even confirmed that patients were happier and improving in healthier ways. In other words, the change of behavior had in fact produced a better good which turned out to be perceived as better good for the pacient and the professional and the whole business entity. In other words, the value of having patients happier were slight improved with an idea of healthier which helped to form a healthier relationship which helped the professinal to achieve clarity about what to say and how to train herself. 

Plus, the change, when it is time to apply, will be tough which will need either transparency, explanations, education - thus there is effort, and it pulls into a zone of uncomfort. Just like the professional has to take care of her customers, abstracting beyond the each served event, in a holistic way which in the case of the psychologist professional has to do with the "prontuário"; there is the same in-perfective reflective writing for the entity or group of customers versus the value for the business growth whch relates to what is better for them? What conditions or conditioning of my customers can put me in a good position to help them even more? What customers I will eventually have to educate them or say no. 

It implies that you can create solutions and many of them can even become simple solutions, such as phrases. For example, indicating to participants where the bathroom is or presenting certain points that govern good relationship health. These solutions are implemented in proportion to the transparency of these "regulation" systems, whether in contracts, in hallways, in communications, by other participants, and collaborators. Thus, it might have to do with culture, a culture that regulates the constituents to establish conditions of growth and equilibrium for success, which requires placing the customer in certain categories and under certain behaviors too.

Consider the complex situation that people can get into as they are going through these layers which according to Reid Hoffman are part of the situation where "the game changes" or that "what got you here is not all to get you there." More specific tuning to Reid's through, what happens is that in this phase we go from doers to become managers of ourselves and managers of doer. In this context, Reid illustrates a situation and a takeway that he had learned from Fred Kofmann in Conscious Business. When asked about the classic mistakes of entrepreneurs by Chase Jarvis (ChaseJarvis, 2017) Reid had brought the problem of transitions in leadership, and the key takeway he had learned from Fred Kofman in *Conscious Business* [^footnote_fred_kofman_conscious_business] pointing that compassion is a way to help people understand these transitions and to access a mature viewpoint that considers the new layers or the whole organization: 

[^footnote_fred_kofman_conscious_business]: Fred Kofman, a renowned thought leader in the fields of leadership and organizational development, advocates in Conscious Business (2006), for the approach that involves moving beyond the confines of self-interest and immediate team objectives, towards accessing higher layers of awareness about values where the collective purpose is considered.

> *"Fred makes this awesome and very important point in the book, which is, if you think of compassion, like, for example, doctors working on patients. And you say, 'Well, this doctor is not doing the job well.' Well, when you actually get them out of the building, you're actually being hugely compassionate to patients."* (ChaseJarvis, 2017, 50:14)

The point and illustration from Reid help us to return and understand the difficulties of the professional that is having issues with a coworker-friend but struggles to transcend the friendship such as to engage and the possibility that firing her friend actually means doing good. In other words, the possibility of supporting the friend gets in the way because of the priour views and values that are outstanding. This situation also set us to see that these might be lagging values under the rising opportunity of the organization in the future. This also is not far from the prior situation of the entrepreneur that struggles with the mom's response. It's just that the mom's concerns are transcending back to the core element of keeping her child alive and well which depends on the establishment of securities first before any risk with ideas like "make sure your job has health insurance," as Brian has pointed out.  

Thus, we are all essentially trying to first to understand and then to consider breaking the value-based assumptions, which likely supports the arguments of the parties involved, in the face of openning up and developing the Conscious Business (2006) where other layers can be acessed, where impact of the whole system can be checked by checking the views from the many constituents and systems involved.

With this, it becomes difficult to transcend, interpret, and try to create ways for a new future to pave the way for improvements; that to break the current assumptions involves breaking through the wall of protection - where the bricks appears to be arguments, data and where the foundation is supported by values. When that psychologist faced the challenge of "at this moment, I can't do that to my patient," she essentially could not break the wall as her level of compassion with saving the patients were stronger to a point she didn't see that she were failing with the whole organization, her clinic, her business, her role as a leader.

--> 

### The valuation of feedback through growth  







The main point is that there actually other aspects to the notion of the degree of honesty offered by people such as people in our circles. When honesty appears to fail it may be also be that feedback in inherently biased by other underlying values which are quite honest assumptions and ties in the nature of the network. In other words, the lesson from the mother situation is a iconic takeway that given that she was programmed to care, and to protect the being that needs safety before risk, her honesty level is generally adjusted accordingly, such as 90% or any other setting she wants, and she does that because she is driven by love - the hing that transcends time and space. 

Thus, to break that wall will be certain be difficult. And likewise more walls are to come our way and most of them always supported by values from the point of the view of the ones that represent their struggles, their causes, their views. Naturally, and moreover, we are celebrating the two sides of this coin, that it is relevant to know who these people are, what they care, what are the values that they are considering, and the like. In other words, and in the end, or actually in fact in the beginning, what matters is us to be aware that the feedback has ties.

#### Towards growth and the risks of representativeness 





The introduction of new models of behavior, although might be recognized as important, is tough to get in the agenda as the values that are present, like having patients, does protect the doer from engaging with practices that are uncertain and which would demand learning. In this regard, it is unescapable the comparison between the value of present results, baked at the simplest level by the notion that execution matters, with what on the other hand, at the simplest level would mean the possilibity of a an effort of a theoretical nature yet to be tested. 

Furthermore, the attachment to numbers, which are captured and perceived as representation of value, may show a version of the urgent entrepreneur-executor that does exercise a basic need to close the gap in the sense of closing the gap towards the final product, reflecting a reaction from an obsession, or pressure, or lack of external viewpoints, which may lead to the a temptation that end is getting closer by a virtue of a movement which disregard the means. This idea aligns with William Zinsser's perspective in "The Tyranny of The Final Product." Zinsser (2006) elaborated on the fixation of a culture oriented toward winning results, noting that professional authors are frequently asked, "How can I sell my writing?" He insists that "if the process is sound, the product will take care of itself, and sales are likely to follow" (p. 254).

But worse than a general inclination, it is equally critical the rise of a characteristic of a kind of criticism that is not "as benevolent" which goes along with the modern version of criticism which is framed by the urges to select, in the sense of filter-first think-later, by using elimination methods which in essence consists of looking at quantitative aspects from data that seems representatives, like measures such as high or low points, thus typical of what a professional judge would do under thepressure of the judgement due date that is outstanding. 

Julia Cameron, in The Right to Write, uncovers a complication from the life of the writer-in-progress where modern criticism plays a role of an adversarial position, given by the circumstances such as school or the media, which is not only bad but different from the kind of benevolent influence (1998, p. 178) that criticism used to be in the sense of supporting and providing encouragement. Needless it is to point that the circunstances of growth, and the demands for validated learning, and tests, makes a pressure for this contest-oriented operational reality that is configured by the evidence of any data point. Here is where we start to get the feeling that what we value in the now is likely to support the end as it is valued by measurable feedback. This goes inline with saying, in other words, that the hunger to measure anything eats strategy for breakfast; which supports the inclination to close the gap by adjusting the processes that makes the numbers, more or less of incrementally, conversely ignore new planning, embrancing change.

* outline - Answer -                \___ Seeking to please reflection 
--> 

#### Towards crowds and the risks of pleasing  






In the prior chapter, we have considered a reflection about the trap of pleasing, or over-pleasing, where we have focused in the case where pleasing offered a wall which prevented entrepreneurs to see through, to access value ahead. Now, in the context of the priorization of activities, it is worth first to recognize the essence of pleasing which may have roots in the needs for approval, endorsement, support. Therefore, and differentiating from the openning given by the prior chapter, although pleasing might have honorable beginnings, the dynamics of these relationships such as customer relationship, relationships through product and offering, may lead to the complex situation which is illustrated by the extremme, over-pleasing, which is when who offers the offering essencially engages in a behavior alike to the situation of a mom as depicted, which conversely may be seen as lack of honesty, although by the self usually recognized as - I am offering another level of value such as "I care about you" or "I love you," which essencially reveals what can be for some perceived as a fraud, or a corruption, but nevertheless shows that time and resources might be wasted.   

Therefore, as they venture into networking and interactions with the goals of growth, entrepreneurs are often eager to engage with external interactions to get their approval, which may include interactions through the offerings. The situation gets complex then when feedback gets in the way which appears to have worked, that it is pleasing indeed. Yet, through these efforts to cater to this feedback assumed to be supportive, entrepreneurs may drift away from their original vision and core values. In other words, in this effort to please, which sometimes gets confused with offering value, they might lose the very essence that could have shaped a unique and remarkable solution, they can delay facing a real problem, and so on. 

It should be noted that pleasing might be used strategically or not as a process of learning. In the situation of Perseverance, the first known steamboat service by the inventor John Fitch refered in part one, free food and drinks were offered as movement of desperation (Klein, 2009, p. 46) that didn't save the service from failure. Therefore, the pleasing wasn't enough to create a confusion to the team, such as to obfuscate the built-in problems with the offering. 

Consider the world of gastronomy around us, a restaurateur begins her journey with a unique vision: offering a single, well-crafted vegan pizza each day. However, as she starts responding to customer feedback and revenue pressures, she introduces more variety, even going as far as to include non-vegan options. Her original vision is now blurry and she might drive beyound the point of no return. The once unique pizza that she loved has morphed into a commonplace restaurant. Although she could still make a living, assuming she kept the average customer, still she struggles with the battle of commonness, not counting the fact she does not like to serve meat-based pizza. 

An even more extreme case is that of a pizza place offering an astounding 256 different pizza toppings, all derived from just eight ingredients. This case underscores the potential for a business to lose its essence in the pursuit of pleasing everyone.

Sometimes, entrepreneurs resort to radical adaptations to stand out. A case in point is the trend of Brazilian pizza places offering sweet pizzas, a daring deviation from the norm, aiming to differentiate themselves. One of the early creations were about banana pizza with sugar, which some people may have been mad for a while but then in retrospect they are now happy as they see pizzas with mm toppings all over. Now the banana pizza is a blessing. And yet to conclude this section with the restaurant situation, consider the small pizza place that wants to follow the linear construction by listening to every single customer, if we name them by their needs - salt, salt plus, salt minus, pepper plus, pepper too much, I hate petter, more cheese, less cheese. Lucky would be the owner if they were expressing like that but in reality it comes like "there is too much pepper" exactly when the owner had tested a spicy pizza and gave it for free for the sake of feedback. In the end, after trying experiments and listening, his pizzas are average, tasteless, or as a friend would say "paintbrush water." Just as an aside, I was once walking by a plaza in Palo Alto and have seen an interesting booth like a futuristic tiny house made of metal pieces that looked like sun-powered panels. A person was in there and I asked what was that about. He said he was an artist taking photos of places of Palo Alto and his intent was to arrive at the average color of Palo Alto to which I said "you mean a green-grayish?" I don't recall how the conversation ended but I could see a possibility of an average color of a city to be something beautiful.

#### A check with principles 







Commitments can also serve as a powerful counter-strategy to our automatic reactions - such as to break other commitments in place. For instance, you want to introduce a new sandwich to the menu of your food truck, but time constraints are a barrier. Announcing the product before its actual launch, or even pre-releasing it as a prototype, can be a commitment that one can do especially if it stands with a principle behind it since the specific prototype is certainly - and initially - seen as a nuissance as it can be expensive or to cause distraction. 

An nice example from the realm of breaking habits - to stop smoking - with ideas from the philosopher Robert Nozick's, are explained by Professor Tamar Gendler, in her lecture on *Weakness of Will and Procrastination*: 

> *"Smoking a single cigarette isn't so bad, but smoking lots of cigarettes is. And one thing that a principle can do is to let any one instance stand as an example of all. Principles, says Nozick, constitute a way of binding ourselves to the mast, not through external constraints like ropes, but through internal commitments to following their mandates. And he points out that principles are effective in a wide range of cases. Intellectually, if you have the idea that there's a principle that connects one set of facts to another, then the principle can transmit probability or support."* (Gendler, 2012, 37:09)

In the context of our expensive sandwich prototype, the unique materialization of the product represents a commitment to innovation and future growth. In essence, you make a commitment where, in a way, you tactically "deceive" yourself to react differently from your standard behavior. 

By aligning your identity with a vision of the future and establishing a commitment to anticipated change, you foster a sense of stability, which can give you a chance to avoid automatic reactions. In the case of the sandwich prototype, this could help you when a first customer says the flavor is lacking; you could respond that the product is still in development and that the feedback given will be considered, in addition to offering apologies to the customer. Notices that - again - communication, clarity, reflective writing, conversations, can be enligthening. 

In conclusion, we know that our innate reaction can compel us to fix problems quickly - which is good. However, our quick and automatic reaction can also be paused and call for a moment of reflection - about our possible actions. Furthermore, we can justify activating strategic thinking that can pave the way for long-term solutions. By reflecting on our natural tendencies, we can initiate positive changes, leading us more quickly to a better future.

#### Proteced by local-global representativeness 






For every venture, there's a outstanding necessity of groth, which is the idea that the product needs to be launched to a market, although the market may start like a prototype of what is the market, and then, if traction through the interacion with the market is shown, then a larger market is innevitable. But nevertheless these confrontations with the market ahead happen throught what some entrepreneurs call it a launch - others may call it an inauguration. But essentially, it's a projection, where these elements are in a way or another offered to elements, like customers, which gives feedbacks after a consumption of the offering. The feedback may happen in different ways, like actual qualitative feedback given, ratings, by the very premium paid, and more. 

The idea of launching unfinished products has become normal, with the understanding that there is no service or product that is pre-thought perfectly or that there is no product that survives contact with the customer without undergoing modifications, in the same way that there is no business plan that survives a first customer [^footnote_steve_businessplan_fail]. 

Additionally, situations of this highly interactive "launching process" are increasingly common, although less apparent in the offline world, but quite clear in the online world where teams launch their projects again and again to iterate, to improve, based on interactive experiences with the market or what they think is their market. That is, the process of reviewing and improving offerings as linked to the participation of the external environment, for example with the involvement of data from customers or from other sources to which they believe represents a truth that supports growth. 

[^footnote_steve_businessplan_fail]:

But that is easy to think if we are considering a sort of in-vitro experiment. The complication, however, lies in the trenches of execution where the notion of representativeness heuristics [^foonote_representativeness_james_green] is recognized as present, which is one way to describe the necessity where any startup team deals with a subjective reality which is a result of their need to validate hypothesis however through limited experiements that touches the external environment. In other words, they are essentially navigating the space to collect data that supports more investment, as in seeking patterns or signals that can guide decision-making. This situation makes representativeness to be both the problem and the solution, as the earlier the stages, the bets are higher which is to say that the signals being sought do represent support about directions more than the actual truths in the sense of validation. In other words, the "good data" in the beginning is essencially patterns which would lead a team to come up with more mature, or concrete, experiments where, as maturity grows across iterations, the data would then reveal closer to truths, where an actual live product being used reveals even closer. 

[^foonote_representativeness_james_green]: The element of representativeness, as refered by the professor James Green, in his work Opportunity Analysis Canvas (2015), is a characteristic or tendency of entrepreneurial behavior to trust what is heard and seen in the nearby domain - such as relying on previous knowledge, already known data, their own customers, friends, and the like. 

The complication out of this situation is exactly that the signals collected that support values - perceived as necessary or sought - create anchors, like a force that supports a direction which pulls a natural objection against new efforts where new experiments tend to be viewed of as of arbitrary; not entirely due to what was found represents truths but because the results in a direction are quite meaningful being that the offering is a not yet a well-done solution. In other other words, a half-way product in the right direction will win when compared with other less than half-way product in a direction yet to be tested. 

As an example, if a startup serves fresh vegetables to local customers, and if the team serves them well, there are ties with serving them well which may prevent the team to use time to serve existing or new customers in different ways, as the system can't generally embrace the new costs, or other complications such as to serving different groups of customers in different ways, serving new customers at the risk of serving poorly the group of current customers, and the like. 

Now, what is revealed by this exercise is a tension of the extremmes, between constructing linearly via aggregating in a sort of direction, which sets the team into all sorts of future problems such as when an underlying aspect has to be revisited, versus the the ideal non-linear concept of testing various offerings in front of different groups which can be generally considered when the team says "well, we can create cohorts," which is essencially a way to protect groups of customers. But the beauty in the theory, again, does not necessarity translate into solutions in the trenches of doing it, again because of the very points of urgency, of the feedback as valued by values, such as "if we make a new cohort, we might be using time which should be used to keep our customers happy." Therefore, noticing this tension as a complication, set us to seek solutions such as cases where teams are able to improve the richness of iterations in ways that supports their growth. 

In this regard, it is worth considering the case of Airbnb, which is real case where the process of launching several seemed possible. According to co-founder Brian Chesky (2015), Airbnb was launching their startup several times, as they communicated to bloggers who wrote about Airbnb organically - as in not paid - and this paved the way for more important publications, such as CNN or The New York Times, to eventually write about it. But the points of press, tough revealled by Brian, should not confuse us about the underlying process of learning that Airbnb team had the chance to get into, and more important which is a reflection about the conditions, or factors, that enabled Airbnb team to consistently navigate that space of protection such as to be free of the tension and likely liberating them to learn.  

> *"Oh man, so we're one of the companies that launched a bunch of times. I actually learned something, because we kept doing launches to get a lot of press: If you launch and no one notices, you can actually just keep launching. (laughter) And so, we just kept launching. Like, 'We've launched!' And people would keep writing about it, as if we launched. We're like, we'll just keep launching until we get customers. And we would change things and change the name, and we'd launch again. And so the first so-called launch was that first weekend, but that was just three people. The second launch was Air Beds and Conference United States. And we had two customers, I was one of them. And so we decided, we'll launch at least one more time. When I used it in South by Southwest, at the time, there was no payments and you had to stay in an airbed. And a bunch of people was telling me a bunch of things. They said, 'Why do I have to... like, I want to go to London, but there's no conference.' And we're like, 'Why does this have to be for conferences?' At the time, that wasn't even obvious. Why would anyone stay in anyone's home if there wasn't a conference? It would be too weird. And then we thought, 'Wait, why does it have to be on air beds?'"* (Chesky, 2015, 9:40-10:38)

The statement of Brian indicates indeed an ideal situation, from a product in development perspective, or the situation with that goes along with the saying that if tree falls in the forest and no one saw it, did it really fall? Therefore, the greater benefits of that stage didn't lie in the benefits of launching for the sake of launching, such as press for press or press for customers, but the revealed insight that learning from real experiences were happening through the multiple launches; which by the way goes along with the lean movement where experiments exist to bring about data that can help the team to improve the value proposition, the idea of ideal customes, and the like. 

Now, and quite important as we seek the conditions that allowed Airbnb to exercise that interaction with freedom, is the indication of the release of that tension when he said that "If you launch and no one notices, you can actually just keep launching." This is a powerful statement that in fact reveals that the team were free from prior valuation of feedback given, as in it resonates with the idea of freedom where the team feels good to testing out interactions in front of a completely new customers, and doing so whatever they tested could bring in learnings from the prior experiments and at the same time run the risk of testing new ideas with no further damage. In other words, it is possible to consider that the experiments associated with the conferences, at locations, gave them a good condition to engage with the benefits of doing one-time experiments, like an event. 

Now, of course and depending on the team culture, they were subject to running through conferences and aggregating features as in the extremme situation of summing up all the things customers loved which would indeed take them into a bad product or bloated system to maintain. Nevertheless, it can then be established, at least for the purpose of this reflection, the sistuation where the data from local interactions might provoke teams to consider that learning from local experiments leads to either add, or bundle, or subtract, or unbundle, based on listening, which essentially allows for revisiting aspects of the value proposition.

Now, and to support another factor of the team culture of Airbnb, it should be also acknowledged that Airbnb team had the opportunity to be mentored by thoughts of a protective nature, in the sense of liberating a team from pressures. In this regard, Brian recognized the role of the advisor Paul Graham [^footnote_paul_graham_presence] and his thoughts - and ideas related to the article "Do things that don't scale" - as a mentor-advisor that sucessfully promoted a principle which essentially allowed the team to go seek value from early interactions as opposed to focusing in the growth of numbers, like customers: 

[^footnote_paul_graham_presence]: Note that the role of Paul Graham had enabled access to viewpoints by principles given by his status, such as by his reputation, character, wisdom or his role in the top-tier venture capital and accelerator Y Combinator; which undeniably reveals that teams may be able to see through, or shock-absorb their inclinations, or as Paul Graham would call, instincts. 

> *"Probably the most important single piece of advice I got, which is probably advice that is probably the most important advice I can give you, or one of the most important advice, is he [Paul Graham] basically drew out this chart and he basically said, it's better to have 100 people that love you, 100 customers that love you, than a million customers that just sort of like you. In other words, if you have 100 people that absolutely love your product, they'll tell 100 people, and then they'll tell 100 people, or even 10 people, and this thing will grow. We call it growing virally."* (Chesky, 2015, 22:01-22:32)

The above statement of Brian reveals a tension, and the complication, as it apparently states that in order to grown the team shouldn't seek growth, which would sound as generic, romantic, or unrealistic; especially if the ideas are given out with no regard to context of Airbnb at the time. Part of this context is that the proposition of Airbnb initially consisted of offering stays for groups to share space for short stays around conferences at locations. By that, it is natural that the customers that attended conference X would not right away attend the next conference, which essentially would make it less troublesome for relaunching since a new launch with new terms were likely not directly impacting prio r customers, this enabling them to more properly test and learn from local experiments and to see transcendence of a product in terms of the pursuit for value essentials as opposed to summing up features by the ties with all the prior customers.  Another aspect of the situation of Airbnb that helps to the case of slowing down to search for special value has ties to what theme of viral growth indicated by Brian, which is that Airbnb essentially started as multisided marketplace, with house owners on one side and customers for the short-term stays on the other side and likewise very important to consider the phenomenon of the struggle of people to either accept anonymous people on their houses or on the other end the struggle of the traveller to enter a new unknown space with others which they didn't know in a house they didn't trust too. 

In other words, Airbnb weren't jumping from conference to conference acquiring users by the launches as in using marketing to advertise a service that was initially bundled and static, like a listing place with available houses for shared stays. They essence in doing things that don't scale, and launching and experimenting across locations essentially enabled them to learn with isolation, therefore enabling them to find the right interaction experience tuned to not only remove fears from both sides of the marketplace but making them happier - house owners and travellers. With this isolation, or freedom to experiment, they were essentially in a better position to growh the value first which took them into a safer position and more exposure leading to improving their market such as adapting the service to short term stays for travel in general such as what they explored with the stays in the city of New York. 

To close, for every local tests you do, your team will likely deal with the tension which rises from the consideration that, on one extremme what was leaned from a prior interaction, values given by feedback, might become apparent in the product to be tested in another locality. And the other extremme, if one could run the world with no regards to the use of resources or reputation, where the re-run of interaction experiments could be done again and again with totally different propositions up to the point of discovering value.  





#### Protecting by leadership

Requires respect to the fact that things won't go so well as I am doing manually. 

The design phase of management is one particular aspect that goes along with execution, cause management doesn't see aspects of an entrepreneur effort as isolated. It is concerned with the past, present, and future. Because of this nature, the manager may find herself in a particular situation of leadership. This particular situation might recognize when a manager is critical in its role. 

When she manages the present and also the future and therefore feels as necessary - or using Peter Drucker terms, to be someone - and the same is the general perception of her peers. 

From this situation, it comes the possibility that she might need to leave, to be absent, such as to take time off. But vacation can't happen. With that, vacation never happens because the possibility of taking her out implies that things might go off track. That the state of health for the organization's future and present might be at risk. In other words, risk for anything planned for its future, plus stability for the situation of the present.

When she really faces the fact that the release of herself is likely necessary, therefore, comes the complication and work that consists of separating her roles, what she does for the present and future needs. From another perspective, it is an opportunity for her to "automate" her responsibilities or seek the traits that would make her, or the analytis of herself in autopilot, taken for granted. 

Therefore, it seems that part of what management does is really about automation which aims for producing change in the organization. Or, change that serves growth. 


##### Conclusion?


As interpersonal relationship arises, feedback systems chimes in. We gotta be driven by and free of. And going back to values of higher-order goals, going back to values of a system that gives people opportunity to grow, are important aspects to nurture time for. Thus, it is the responsibility of the entrepreneur and the executive team to deal with this, to use time for this, mapping, unbundling, being a critic and being a growth mentor, giving permission too, openning protective spaces of bets and separating risk analysis. 

As an aside of the phenomenon, I ask us to go back to that extremme situation pointed: how easy it is to get approved anything that supports values, such as the values that we have captured and perceived, and conversely how difficult we make for strategic ideas to get in our way. I will close with the situation of writers: If I happen to become good in writing in English, as in grammatically correct, I might value that to a point that wouldn't allow myself to write poorly in terms of grammar. But what if writing poorly, or more freely, were the closest path to finding something beautiful and meaningful. To close, entrepreneurship is like writing.
