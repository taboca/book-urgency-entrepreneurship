### CEO role is to bringing the pieces together

* One — there are best practices, and the CEO needs basic superpowers,
or to develop the proficiency for all the best practices: commission
structure for sales, marketing, etc;

* The other part is — that you can't give these roles to anyone. The
core of the idea is to have the proficiency so that you find the
smarter person to be in the role;

* Great CEOs have proficiency in every discipline, and they hire
people smarter than them in every discipline;

* When you see this sense in CEOs, you get a sense that they can make
it: When they understand of how these areas, and roles, helps to make
the whole story to work. And they are not the smartest but they have a
perspective. This relates to the notion of the founder or category
design role to have developed the roadmap for everyone in relation to
the point of view;

* Knowing that they will have experts in all the fields is not an
excuse for not having the minimum level of competency;
