## Todo 

* ( ) Check feeling insight - Vanessa one day said "I will not have the fear anymore" as she was referring to the fear that blocks her from saying no to her patients, like to charge them or to inform them of their lack of presence. 

* p1, ( ) reorder - It seems that "time for unreadiness" has to do with Julia Cameron's Containment concept, where protection has to exist, and the nurturing of the critic for growth to emerge, the one that is compassionate for the under development collaborator. This is under a subsection within 210_automatic_reaction_breaking... ref 43849384-43984983-4938948-5935935

* ( ) Style and wording - In "autopilot vs. manual" which is a title that should be revisited; nevertheless, if "autopilot vs. manual" is a seriously considered metaphor, we might need a clear idea that manual, for most people, is a sort of autopilot anyway. Thus, if people think that "manual" is autopilot, the title serves for nothing. It confuses them. Anyway, assuming that the point of "manual" is strategic allowance for solving that is ahead and unknown, then the point is to really consider the strategies, such as replacements like "the redesign of another autopilot", replacing the executor that is going towards vacation, pre-mortem of the role of strategy for the sake of using another, and more. 

## Title 

* v0.3 - Reconstructing growth feedback 
* v0.2 - Autopilot
* v0.1 - You just don't turn it off 

## Part 

* On part 1, for now. 
* ( ) Consider to move to 300, as things will account more reaction if works 
* Note: The individual is provoked to fix the gap of now.

## SCqA (deprecated, it is a dup of 300_execution_urgency_neglecting_redesign)

* Subject - Deals with the denial of execution with no room allowed for breaking present needs. 

* Situation - Things gains traction. Gaps show. We can fix. It's nice. You will respond, with execution to fix. 
* Complication - You can be wasting time, you can't see from perspective. Worse? You just started to make it work, and how you have to reinvent? 
* Answer - For growth, embrace future. 

* pitch - objections - rain on your parade. 
* pitch - objections - we are learning. 
* pitch - objections - how long should we push? 

* Editorial - note - creative and style. In Rambo I, first blood, when Rambo destroys the city, Cel Trautman comes to the police station to talk with Rambo, commanding him - it's over. But Rambo is not okay with that idea, although he starts to find the actual confrontation that he has to turn it off. Rambo accepts to go to jail with the support from his protector, his real coach.
