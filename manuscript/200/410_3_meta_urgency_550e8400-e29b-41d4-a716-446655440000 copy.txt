### Writing perspective 

* Ideas - Bundling vs. unbundling. When urgency comes our way, it seems that it is like auto bundle is happening. From that you can be either a victim of the situation, which can prompt us to be stuck, to react to maintain the box, to untouch it. Or you can be exposed to the learnings, into the box, and do nothing. Or you can reflect in and out from the box, and which let you unbundle all of it, and perhaps come up with a new storyline which can be provoked to the team, which can be liberating - of course which will incur risks. 

* Ideas - Urgent might be the learning, or can be stuck, change?
* Questions - Could check Eisenhower's matrix by 7 Habits - Marcio has the book - and also which were the origins of the thinking of the matrix, does it bring up the point about that urgent vs. important has to do with something like interference?

### Short outline - SCqA based 

* Subject - Things become urgent, after an initial movement that shows signs of traction; traction that had reached a sort of impact. The discussion important vs. urgent sets in, if the team starts to consinder the price to pay, such as that they startup can fail entirely; unless they can reinvent themselves and go back to the unsafe position where opportunity might exist, aiming for a better future. 

* Situation - Activities that shows signs of working starts to take the attention from the team. 
* Situation - We value traction as opposed to the doubt or unknown. 
* Situation - Strategic activities, and even stratetic planning, receives less attention, with the sharing of resources. 

* Complication - Urgent becomes urgent because we value activities with more real feedback. 
* Complication - Urgent problems seem to be good problems. 
* Complication - Difficult to let it go, under the assumption this focus area will save everything?

* Question - What and why is that? And can teams break urgency and extend their tolerance to go seek something better? 

* Answer intro - We will see how we experience forces of feedback "enters the game" especially that under the new reality of feedback, a prior vision can be compared and may become weak. Under pressure, backed by values, by principles, and representation of success goals plays a role. 

* Answer intro - To solve, it is about being protected, like an investment, which requires a view and team commitment to what is important, to vision, to goals and using analysis that transcends the urgent realities.

### SCqA v0.5 

* Subject - When activities are executed as urgent, execution might have reached a saturation point which would also call for the discussion - important vs. urgent. But as urgent is urgent based on feedback systems that take place, new ideas such and discussions about important activities can be killed. We should consider a reflection about the feedback systems and values that keep the equilibrium and the team to consider engaging in new activities which could help with change and innovation. 

* Situation - The theme, important vs. urgent, becomes a subject when what is being done reaches a sort of 100%, saturation preventing change and improvement of the work process. Unless urgent activities shows a major sign of trouble, it is difficult for teams to see through, think through, and justify use of time that is strategic; as the traction with activities taken as urgent feeds a system of value that keeps an equilibrium that seems promising. 

* Complication - A system of values supports the feedback system which makes urgent to become urgent. A team success finds good problems which ties with good reasons to solve these good problems. Like customers - good problems. Good reasons to support all customers could be that the prior investment was major effort to go seek customers. 

* Question - How teams can break urgency that opens space for reflection and possibilities to drop some of the urgent activities to consider non-urgent and important and, quite risky. 

* Answer - The answer lies in seeking protection, like by reviewing values, or principles, or setting roles that represent new goals. Although a simple idea, the odds for not happening is high, due to urgency to maintain the equilibrium (we will see how we experience this), due to lack of clear views of values, principles affecting the feedback that feeds urgency, and due to lack of representation and support to what is ahead vs. risks.  


### SCqA v0.4  

* Subject - When urgent is apparent, execution might have reached a saturation, and feedback systems take place justifying urgent which may prevent the space of review, design, and buy-in to new what is important, change. 

* Situation - Important vs. Urgent becomes a subject, a theme that appears, as urgent things gets 100%, saturation. In a way the system of success of it might have come to terms; although it lifts motivations, prompts, asking to break urgent, 

* Complication - Feedback systems in place, driving the urgent, may be influencing now and prevents important. 

* Q - 

* A - 

### SCqA v0.3 

* Subject - At the individual level, important vs. urgent chimes in. The urgent is safe, what we can do. Depending on important we might have to face virtuosity construction. Be nice with your unknown path. 
* Situation - Entrepreneurs know that important is generally not done in the face of what is urgent. Sometimes the belief is that by acting on urgent, benefits may open room for solving what is important later. Like cleaning the room after having some success in the streets. 
* Complication - Facing important triggers other problems. After "no time for that", we find stones in our ways, such as the need to plan in the face of fears, strong emotions, and more. We need to allow the young apprentice to navigate the uncertain path of important. This is the door to infinite apprentice. 
* Q / A - Solution? Starts with courage, to have time, to be nice #compassion with that weak being.

### SCqA v0.2 

* Subject - When things start to work, we are driving by feedback, but we might fail to track feedback by the right goggles. 
* Situation - The breakfast place start to happen, we fail to see future in the past
* Complication - How to be strategic and open space for important? And to not fear discovering and design of what is important. 

### SCqA v0.1 (deprecated, it is a dup of 300_execution_urgency_neglecting_redesign)

* Subject - Deals with the denial of execution with no room allowed for breaking present needs. 

* Situation - Things gains traction. Gaps show. We can fix. It's nice. You will respond, with execution to fix. 
* Complication - You can be wasting time, you can't see from perspective. Worse? You just started to make it work, and how you have to reinvent? 
* Answer - For growth, embrace future. 

* pitch - objections - rain on your parade. 
* pitch - objections - we are learning. 
* pitch - objections - how long should we push? 

* Editorial - note - creative and style. In Rambo I, first blood, when Rambo destroys the city, Cel Trautman comes to the police station to talk with Rambo, commanding him - it's over. But Rambo is not okay with that idea, although he starts to find the actual confrontation that he has to turn it off. Rambo accepts to go to jail with the support from his protector, his real coach.

* ( ) p2, Consider Maslow / * Abe maslow, p.178 - for Maslow, a question of time and time span affects collaboration and management. The illustration is of an environment where quick decisions are needed. In this situation, the superior (in the case of maslow a player that is superior in Intelligence) have a tendency to make decisions quick, to be directive, authoritative and to not allow room for discussion. It's an urgent agenda with no time for redesigning, possibly allowing actions such as harvesting or applying the potential that is on the table. On the other hand, there could be a situation that more time is allowed, thus in this scenario the superior can act differently. In this case, Maslow considered the building of a business to last for 50-100 years. In such protected frame, the dynamics of the group could be different and tending to the participative front, even in the condition of a natural unbalance with superiority of manager amid subordinates. If the time range is higher, such as if we extrapolate to the point of the need for a manager to find its sucessor, then the authoritativeness approach may become different, such as it may have better chances to tend to the manager approach as pointed by Andy Grove, the manager as an educator for example. *  Maslow adds, p.178, "this is a little like saying again that the ideal management policies are best under good conditions in a good world for management of good people. " And "If we had a peaceful, one-world society in which there were none of the present emergencies and in which we could patiently work toward the improvement of mankind, then the more participative management would be more desirable, even under this special condition of admitted superiority. "

* ( ) p2, To Feedback of Urgency, Andy Grove in (p.33) of "High Output Management" considers our direct response to productivity versus when we take a step back: "The productivity of any function occuring within it is the output divided by the labor required to generate the output. Thus, one way to increase productivity is to do whatever we are now doing, but faster. This could be done by reorganizing the work area or just by working harder. He we've not changed what work we do, we've just instituted ways to do it faster - getting more activities per employee-hour to go on inside the black box. Because the output of the black box is proportional to the activity that occurs within it, we will get more output per hour. " And followed by "There is a second way to improve productivity. We can change the *nature* of the work performed: what we do, not how fast we do it. " / 32397293-2084820-49828849-4928492

* ( ) Check - fear of loss, used, above, which was brought up in other chapter. 

* p1, ( ) insight - check containment protection notion (feat. Julia Cameron, p178-180) with 210_automatic_reaction_breaking and "lean narratives" or #okr #shock-absorbers - check if group thinking carrying values, such as values tied to outcomes, can supress the opportunity when growth of an individual would be possible, ideas for example, by using "he is best at" could lead to reaarangement into mediocre too - this Julia indicates writers in potential becoming journalists - as seen we supress the inner self that could save the situation. Thus, the topic of protection before critics. Might tie with case of "containment" by Julia Cameron, p168-170, check her amazing quotes on picking the friendly critis or friendly editor vs. protecting. Marcio had designed a notion of a black box producer in the face of a critic, when "under development" or vulnerable work, if seem from as a box, might be killed as exposed. But a strategic growth developer-coach, might see into the box, and unbundle, allowing growth, like p178-180 Julia Cameron indicates. Thus the management consideration could have to do with bundle to criticize and unbundle to allow development and growth. 9438988-4304093490-04304903-4928408 (lean, breaking auto reaction)

* ( ) Check feeling insight - Vanessa one day said "I will not have the fear anymore" as she was referring to the fear that blocks her from saying no to her patients, like to charge them or to inform them of their lack of presence. (Reframing fears or values)

* p1, ( ) reorder - It seems that "time for unreadiness" has to do with Julia Cameron's Containment concept, where protection has to exist, and the nurturing of the critic for growth to emerge, the one that is compassionate for the under development collaborator. Pick quotes from The Right to Write .168-170. This is under a subsection within 410_automatic_reaction_breaking... ref 43849384-43984983-4938948-5935935

* ( ) Title style and idea - In "autopilot vs. manual" which is a title that should be revisited; nevertheless, if "autopilot vs. manual" is a seriously considered metaphor, we might need a clear idea that manual, for most people, is a sort of autopilot anyway. Thus, if people think that "manual" is autopilot, the title serves for nothing. It confuses them. Anyway, assuming that the point of "manual" is strategic allowance for solving that is ahead and unknown, then the point is to really consider the strategies, such as replacements like "the redesign of another autopilot", replacing the executor that is going towards vacation, pre-mortem of the role of strategy for the sake of using another, and more.

### Consider that things can be blocking our way 

O nosso ser gestor pode não estar preparado. Assim, por um lado é merecedor de uma criação e por lado é o mesmo ser, que faz a gestão de tudo isso. Não se engane - é possível ter uma vida de sucesso, por um lado e ao mesmo tempo levar o sucesso com uma conta paralela, uma mal gestão. Aliás muitos dos artistas da história produziam suas artes com a geração de resíduos, muitas vezes até tóxicos, em paralelo. Aliás talvez essa questão seja de fato um dilema dos artistas e uma questão que afeta os empreendedores também. A autora Julia Cameron, especializada em ajudar artistas a enfrentarem seus bloqueios revelou que ela havia vivido uma época que sua criatividade soltava em surtos, como uma veia que jorra sangue, e que entre os surtos de criatividade ela de fato precisava beber. Ela mudou, se redescobriu, passou a tentar gerir sua criatividade, sua produção, para que a produção não dependesse deste custo paralelo, desse acúmulo residual que de fato lhe consumia. Checar isso.

* Interview about Eisenhower matrix and some ideas exchange with Chatgpt https://chat.openai.com/share/a4f3d334-d233-484f-996e-7bef583c5b46 have indicated a sort of common knowledge that the matrix brings a superficial awareness about important vs. urgent. It was pointed as a framework, which seem weird. And also that by what was written in 7 Habits the successful people do work in important non-urgent first. I have, however, brought up a complication in the growth situation of startups or teams; where success such as from working in important non-urgent would lead to a change in the dynamics and new demands for reactionary work, leading to urgent work, which ChatGPT has acknowledged and would perhaps bring a saturation leading to a crisis thus perhaps a chance to consider a new matrix. Well, the very change where urgent tasks arise is a change in itself.

* (x) p2, to Feedback of Urgency - on values that supports feedback, or the valuation of feedback - Andy Grove in p.18 of High Output Management suggests that a key indicator based on output, like the "number of square feet cleaned", "should be paired with a partially objective/partially subjective rating of the quality of work as assessed by a senior manager with an office in that building." This case of Andy shows that a strategic objective/subjective feedback may be applicable to the actual evidence of data which can be seen as feedback or a key indicator. In other words, the role of judgment is applicable on top of a feedback that is outsanding; it enters the system and it supports values. This situation also shows that some of the numbers we monitor might lead us to take them as supportive of other values, this leading us to allow the intrusion or editing of the feedback with a new perspective, and new meaning. And needless to say that under pressure, we might assume that data pouring in means value captured or the conditions towards value being supported. But we shouldn't miss the point of wisdom from Andy which is given by the identification of the pairing indicator. To bring back the origin of his case starts with the idea that a single indicator is not enough, as it supports the forward movement, such as if one rides a bike towards the direction one is looking at (p.17), which makes a case for other indicators that can be paired to improve the quality, or meaning, of what is ultimately being observed or sought, which of course happens in the face of a meaninful goal. In the case of the biker rider, if the biker is into a goal to ride safely, a possible pairing indicator could be monitoring the pitfalls on the way. In other words, Andy makes a case for documentinng the indicator that is being paired which involves reflecting on the goals. This is exactly about establishing a window into the process and evaluating the feedback being received. / 427492-42984829-494294-9828398

* Somar o contexto de que estamos na parte 1, o empreendedor vs. tempo, empreendedor vs. urgências. 

* Neste sentido, preciso de mais um artigo, razão objetivo dos meus prompts aqui para você. Vou antes falar de umas ideias, depois dar um pouco da lógica. 

* Em termos de motivação, um caso, analogias de sucesso na velocidade, sobre fatos ou verdades que nos apoiam sobre o correr, na velocidade. No livro do Ogilvy, Ogilvy on Advertising, existe uma seção intitulada "Why Advertise at All?" Onde o autor, renomado Ogilvy, conta uma história que aconteceu com Mr. Wrigley, industrialista popular de goma de mascar, enquanto viajava de trem. Segundo Ogilvy, foi perguntando ao Mr. Wrigley, em uma viagem de trem, o porque anunciar sendo que ele já era um rei do mercado. Wrigley perguntou a quem lhe perguntou [veja que na real quando o chatgpt for usar isso não faz sentido falar que o Wrigley perguntou a quem perguntou, precisaremos de algo mais inteligente para montar a cena na visão do leitor de que o Wrigley contextualizou com uma pergunta] "How fast do you think this train is going?" quem perguntou respondeu "I would say about 90 miles an hour". Mr. respondeu, "Well, do you suggest we unhitch the engine?" Certamente o caso apresentado, ainda Lógico que no contexto da Wrigley, a frase dele fez sentido. Ele projetou em primeiro lugar saber o que estava fazendo, e a colocação do tipo "time que está ganhando não se mexe" é mais profunda do que o assunto da velocidade. Assim Ogilvy contextualizou bem. Com isso dito, esse pensamento é um pouco na linha das comunicações que nos convencem que toda e qualquer propaganda poderia ser importante. A situação aqui de caso é que existem "modelos de narrativas" que são usadas para colocar valor em questões de decisão, ou dúvidas. 

* Outro caso, a insegurança do risco presente na opção diferente,  é o custo de discutir e repensar, diante da comparação do continuar agindo, na linha do "time que está ganhando não se mexe". Imagine um grupo de 3 desenvolvedores que estão advançando e a vibe também está boa. Agora um deles viu uma questão que poderia mudar, uma necessidade de mudar o código em alguns níveis de abstração. Ele traz uma introdução do problema a tona, na reunião. Mas, convenhamos, aquele não era o momento. A missão deles é render. Ainda, a tentativa de interromper fluxo realmente pode ser devastadora. Tipo, não quero chover no seu carnaval mas... 

* Outro caso, a segurança de execução carrega ética. Convenhamos, existem arquiteturas e implementações. Muitas pessoas são responsáveis pelas implemtações, im,plementações, mas não pela arquitetura ou estratégia. Elas são medidas pelos Key Results, rsultados chave. Em um olhar bem simplista, ou fundamental, a pessoa precisa entregar. E isso de fato é ético, é muito válido. Ou seja, mesmo que o caminho do barco estivesse errado, ainda assim no contexto de avaliação local, é imprtante também remar. A parte de remar, de mobilizar remadores, é em sí muito válida. Isso pode dar suporte para uma negação em cima da possibilidade de parar. 

* Em termos de introdução, vejamos, eu apresentei uma lógica. Gostaria de seguir SCqA sendo a situação o fato que nós usamos narrativas, modelos, exemplos, para fundamentar nossas decisões. A compliação é que essas narrativas passam bem rápido, nas mesas das reuniões, porque elas apresentam elementos de retórica, dão suporte com indução e não exatamente dedução. O modelo de indução é por exemplo o que este artigo faz quando eu apresento 3 casos exemplo que ilustram como as pessoas induzem outras para correr. Enfim, em termos sobre o que se fazer, Q, temos que podemos em primeiro lugar observar se a razão para correr foi bem comunicada - e se sim, anotar lembrar que a qualidade de comunicaçao poderia afetar decisão. Se tem lógica. Se o projeto permite anotar, lembrar, para trazer a possibilidade de freiar com oexercício secundário. Enfim, não precisamos exatamente de contra medidas aqui mas nossa ideia é exercitar que esses modelos são praticados na comunicação, na narrativa de times, sejam chefes (ou pessoas de autoridade), sejam gerentes, membros de times, e nós conosco mesmo (um dos piores vilóes. )

* Com isso, introduçção scqa, e os 3 casos, o título "O potencial indutivo na velocidade", me dê um draft de um artigo.
