## SCqA review v0.2 

* Subject - 

* Situation - People use writing, said or presented, to convince. The urgency to close the gap makes the presenter to skip communication, and just use it, may add arbitrariness, and now help with clarity. Can be ignored by the audiences. 

* Complication - Induction is misundertood, used inrresponsibly, or automatically, from a denial to consider that induction serves the purpose, to add clarity. 

* Question - What to do? Continue to deny and present what is right, and responsible, by ignoring communication? As in all the time proving? 

* Answer - The right is to be in peace with induction, respecting its purpose, and the process of transformation, and clarity, where one adds and build a good structure writing. 

* K1 - it might be style - How it is experienced, it might be style, the deductive mind seens investment in communication as lower, favors value towards what seems rational, logic, data - pulls them to focus on data. We can't see even the true induction, or abuse, if not waste or investment, by the insertion of data. 

* k2 - the inductive machine - The machine is inductive anyway, don't be mad. We need to embrace, it's an inductive world and we need to be responsible to deal with it. Works for a fast track world, transactional, but still how to?

* k3 - The logical horizon. 

* v0.1 -  [ ScqA ] Induction is around, induction attracts. We derive that induction can be used arbitrarily, the complication, abuses. We need to watch out to not fall, and to not comply with; instead consider SCqA.

 [ Add ] Consider SCqA of Barbara Minto, a structured approach for making peace with induction; Not a random way. A way to go. Consider to bring the point that Barbara's approach is the way to solve induction and communication for business folks - the case of the owl according to Michael Dearing. 

 [ Add ] Conclusion - Consider that to make the case to the folks around you, that you depend on, as you move towards with your entrepreneurial journey - such as investors, they will likely know that you are using induction. And they will seek substance.

<!-- scqa: situation --> 

The purpose of this section is to help entrepreneurs to invest in communication that is generally seen as persuative, which is often dismissed as being manipulative, often seen as too complex or too subjective, especially given that the important is given to the truths such as the data. This lack of interest becomes a problem not only because being persuasive is important but it prevents entrepreneurs to invest and understand that communication can be persuasive and honest, and furthermore that the process can be used to achieve clarity, and to support audiences to understand what is being told, more than to convince. 

In the entrepreneurial setting, communication exists in cause change such as to get a proposal approved, to offer a viewpoint about a situation that needs attention, to explain how something works and how to use it, and more. Therefore, what we communicate serves to goals and driven to an audience. From there, we minimally ask their attention, if not engagement, it invites them to join, to collaborate, and more, such as when an entrepreneur asks for money from an investor. 

But as the day goes by failing with communication is part of the duty. Through that, our audiences can be confused, objections are raised, like when an investor asks a founder to stop before they get to the point. While this is inconvenient, it is considered as a nuisance, it is acknowledged as legitimate. In other words, that what has to be told has to be told and if it isn't told in the right way then it is right to find a way around. In other words, it makes sense to accept the failures of communication because it matters more that it serves the rational setting of entrepreneurship. Thus, entrepreneurial communication rests in the intents where the results of the dynamics matters more, such as going after the truths to be uncovered, the problems that to be better explored. This approach is not only honest, it allows the conversation to happen, it is inclusive, and debatable. If this is not a reason to put a low priority for investing in quality of communication as a fear of failing with rationality and reason, if not projections of an evil act as in "wait, are you telling me that we need to write elegantly or persuasively to convince the audience?" 

Now, the complication with this setting, and reason for us to be here, isn't that entrepreneurs believe that improvement in the quality of communication is evil - after all, the honest doer can always control it. But that when comparing the extremmes, poor communication with substance vs. improving in communication and lacking substance - as in rationality is urgent and communication may be somewhat important. 

But as we continue to ignore valuing communication, we continue to communicate in inneficcient ways, to confuse our teams, our audiences. What is even worse is that as we move away from communication, and yet use communication to get something of them, we rather do what we can and add even more of the valid elements, such as data, which puts pressure on the writer-presenter, such as to engage in being manipulative although not even aware, such as to support the end by filling out the right means, with the things that are assumed to serve the logic and the rationality. What is even worse of this setting of denial is that it does not prevent one or other that are skilled in the art and science of communicating, such as in persuasive ways, to do well, and to smoothly convince more especilly if they do a good job of providing supporting data that serves the rationality. 

To support founders to be friendly with focusing in the quality of communication, we will first see that anyway the inductive communication is around, it is unavoidable, used by everyone, but generally dismissed by roles which are systems-oriented. 

 Then we will see how the dynamics of the startup, and any corporate environment, is intrinsically using inductive communication, where the refusal to understand makes only the rational being to operate by following induction. And third, we will find a logical and structured way to advance to improve the quality of communiation with the notion of Executive communication as the kind of communication that is good for solutions-oriented situations. And this is the purpose of this section. To consider inductive writing as valuable, that can be be used honestly by entrepreneurs, not only to be aware of what is being told, but to be conscious of using it responsibly and in a way that truly suppports the goals. In this direction, let us first consider how inductive communication is assesed in the work place and some complications for doers such as technical or engineer mindset. Next, we will consider ...

## How we dismiss 

<!-- scqa: abstract 

it might be style - How it is experienced, it might be style, the deductive mind seens investment in communication as lower, favors value towards what seems rational, logic, data - pulls them to focus on data. We can't see even the true induction, or abuse, if not waste or investment, by the insertion of data. 

--> 

One point to look, from one communication to another, has to do with how one does it. Some people do it with style. Some can do naturally do so well they don't even understand how they do. Some others struggle to put out their ideas with clarity. Others put a lot of work, and struggle, and nothing sticks. So a complication in the corporate work setting - likely perceived by the ones that are young with communication and does not control how the communication style or language of the machine works - is that they might see their voices being shut, not brutally, but mainly by the other voices that sounds more coherent especially under the urgency.  

But we all have experienced that sort of communication that seems persuative, or inductive, although we won't generally refer to that kind of communication as inductive. Nevertheless, it is all around. As I was having coffee before writing the draft for this article, I heard a person that were passing by as he was leaving a voice message to someone. He said "What did you think of my idea?" And right away added the note "although it is not the best solution, what do you think?". After that I couldn't hear more, and it was enough for me. 

He was seemed to be trying to add value to his point. The way he said was also part of the convincing mechanism. Or he knew that the other, on the other end, were likely to cut his idea and needed something the other could agree with. Perhaps he was trying to induce by presenting an implied reason, as if he had said "see, we won't have the time to pick the perfect idea now. Let's move on." And likely was hoping that the other end, in the urgency of the world, would agree with a yes and a let's go with that. 

Although the given illustration was too simple and not even to be considered a solid communicative experience, when we hear these fragments of communication in the average day, such as in the work setting, we can sense a hint of a communication that wants to be persuasive, that has all the intentions to convince, if not a hint of a type of communication that is wrong. And for many that see from that angle, they may set themselves to deny any investment further in communication. 






Now by being a natural-born no communicator, and being able to detect the machine seems inductive anyway ,and likely be mad with the usage, I happened to become a sort of translator of induction into deduction, which can be illustrated the work that I went through by the following situation in the supermarket. as I was in deli section, a lady promoted a product when we were to buy mossarela cheese. Apparently, as far as we knew it, we wanted 200g of mossarela. But before we said the amount, she interrupted us to suggest that we buy the mossarela that were pre-packaged by her (pre sliced and in a combo with prosciutto). She said that the cost, per gram, of that mossarela were less. Needless to say that we were in a hurry, right? We were not there to reason, to think, to get ideas for writing a book or reflecting about the ways people communicate with induction. We were apparently just there to buy mossarela. But I was there and confess having entered in the basic math which is something we do when buying. We never ignore the math, right? I asked her how much was the cost per kilogram of the mossarela alone to which she said 55 brazilian reals. And then she added that the cost per kilogram for the one in the package was 40. So, the basic math seems to work and she also added an inductive expression, with her face, and said that she was there to help. I then asked her what where the cost of the - needless to say cheap/poor quality - prosciutto that came in the package. She said that it was about 30 BRL (Brazilian Reais). The package was half plus half, and somehow I wasn't anymore there to buy but willing to see what was going on. And with another not so simple to do math, I figured that the price per kilogram in the combo package was just the expected average price. So, voila, she was offering 200g of mossarela at its normal price with a 200g of cheap-quality prosciutto in its normal price, although her was limited to the stress the fact that the mossarela was cheaper.

At that point, I've told her that she was selling he prosciutto at a higher price. She smiled and said again that she was there to help and that I could accept her help or not. Being that the love of my life was also next to me, I imagined myself kicking the shelf of bread and we moved on. We picked the pricey prosciutto and the cheap mossarela although we didn't come to the deli section to buy prosciutto. I guess, we were too urgent to pause life right there, or perhaps pausing life seemed wrong, but on the side of the attendant, it was her job.  

Nevertheless my job as not a communicator and not in peace with this kind of communication consisted in being calculating and to fear inductive communication like a super fast train. See, one thing is the train and the other is the cargo. When induction comes our way, it comes with a sound of a train and it prompt us to be on time, to react. If we don't have time to look at the interior of it, to see its cargo and the logic, then we might, even without noticing it, pay the ticket which might cost more as the impact of giving our attention to anything might cost more than the actual price we paid for anything. Watch out for free things, I fear the train. 

### Favoring rationality 

Moreover, Therefore, some people might be go away from being persuasive as for them it adds nothing or that they might fear to be tricking themselves, misleading themselves, that they are being others perhaps even linked to that figure of a salesman that is in hurry to convince. But even if we consider to elaborate further a proposition for inductive communication as a kind that has a lot more to offer and that can be done seriously, the consideration is yet a problem for many people. A big reason might happen for the folks that are creators, makers, engineers, and whoever looks at things from a rational and logical, or a systems-oriented perspective. These folks may see themselves as the brains and originators of ideas. They love deduction, they love to prove, they love to come up with the map, such as a map based on structured ideas, on truths, on their discoveries. Of course, they love to to express their ideas, and they do know that they want to put their ideas out in front of audiences, and they know that they need to get buy-in from them, minimally attention, and seeking support from these audiences. But still, they rather use their precious time to focus in the supporting elements, like the values and the truths, the gems that makes ideas to grow into good ideas and potential solutions. 

But while the ideas, and substance or truths, or data, are the parts of the gears of the work machine, that kind of communication is still a grease required that makes everything moving smoothly. And the enginering, or deductive-oriented mindset, knows that while they are the curators behind the scenes making the bits and pieces that runs, they are dependent anyway of that kind of grase. And, to their happiness and sometimes frustation, they depend on folks that can translate what they have to offer. Now, if we come to this realization, then the question is why should one integrate that additional skill, such as to achieve expertise with inductive and persuasive communication while the engines of many organizations shows that it's not urgent, clearly for the many such as engineers and systems-oriented roles. 



### Critics can't help with communication

--> 


As an aside of the corporate setting, no one tells the writer-doer, the subordinate, that they are being observed under the frames that failing is okay, that their ability to grow with communicative experiences is an opportunity, that they could use writing, and fail, and fail, to learn, to achieve clarity of ideas. Although the executive level, such as the CEO or a anyone in a level of maturity, are in a good position to recognize that as a truth, it is rarely being told. It maybe so due to fear, such as fear that talking about one's writing, or one's communication, would offend or sound like harassement. which goes without saying that adults, or more senior people, are not good critics, that they grew up in a society where they would - in case they expose their criticism - do more in terms of criticizing with an orientation to the eyes of their maturity levels, such as involving the prism of expecting outcomes, which would naturally bring about the sort of product or market oriented critics, not the critics that promotes learning and advancement, which would be considered for them not even a critics, but more like mentorship. Their level, their position, the the moment where a potential willingness to be a critic comes about, is not even a moment for educating, for motivating, for looking at potential value. It's more like a review to avoid risks. Then, with that, nothing is done. You are on your own. 

In other words, the idea that the act of putting it out is part of the writing process, of a process to achieve clarity, is not part of the life of work. In other words, the tendency, and the urge to force writing, said or presented, to serve the end, set us in the wrong focus, that set us to not think of writing as yet another iteration, as if written things were micro products, to be judged, and if that is not enough of a complication, worse it maybe for the doers under the no option situation. In other words, in the end of the day, as writing yet generates tensions (out of its failures, the urges to force, as it pulls objections, as it motivates judgements) the doer gets frustrated, angry, and even worse, that by the nature of work, they can only find one direction which is to add more data, more gems, and to bundle that into what is bring delivered. Thus, by that urge to add value, they not only miss the opportunity to see writing as an opportunity to achieve clarity - as if it is a mean to learn, to be vulnerable, to find actual value - but they add data that convinces too by the excess of value, which can be wasteful, if not evil. 







## Why it matters 






### Grease sticks anyway 

Back in the Silicon Valley days I had an opportunity to get an overview of a kind of inductive communication which I think it is the ugly case. I learned that the hard way. When I was working at one of the iconic companies of Silicon Valley, a few chapters ago, my spoken English were poor and my abilities to control inductive communication poorer - although that does not mean that I wasn't naturally inducing others to react, to decide, such as to accept or ignore my ideas. But anyway I wasn't afraid to say my thoughts which is generally a good thing, and I wanted to convince my peers. So in that meeting I said something like "mada big bada bum, korben, bada bum bada bum," while a local manager chimed right on top of my train of sound and was sharp precise with a clear and sound English that started with "But more importantly,.." and that was enough for everyone to accept his judgement. 

That was a prelude to a big lesson which I could not grasp at the time. But I sort of knew what he did. The real thing I didn't see is that the event was remarkable in my life but remarkable in a bad way which had prepared my investment towards communication, unfortunately, to be stuck in terms of investing. In other words, I wasn't in peace with with using induction, or inductive communication, because that way of communication seemed to be a deal breaker, or deal maker. Perhaps I have seen that in my whole life - in a way or another - but it was too brute to see a manager in a place which I thought as special - Silicon Valley the open book of opportunities. And, to be fair, perhaps implied in what happened that day was the fact that I did my part too - that what I tried to say had paved the way for that manager to bring some equilibrium to the meeting. In other words, in his defense, I started and he reacted in a way to be optimial, perhaps a pragmatic way. Well but for me that was an ugly case and it took ke decates to be in peace and find an enlightened way to grasp inductive communication, in a good way, and in a responsible way. 








### The growth machine demands  

<!-- scqa: k "it might be style" k1.k1

Growth machine demands the test

But it becomes vital to whoever in a position where substance, such as value, has to be created and at the same time the survival for the idea depends on convincing others issessantly, such as to depend on kind of sales after sales, starting with co-founders, to customers, colleagues, partners, investors. This is the situation of founders advancing with their startups where they are tested all the time. Consider the point of view given by Marc Andreessen about the need to invest in the formal presentation: 

> *“For investors, the formal presentation is yet another test. I think the formal presentation is another test . . . As a founder, if you are not good enough at your job as a CEO, to get up and present, to institutional investors, for 60 minutes, and sell them on your thing . . . We love when somebody walks in and has a compelling pitch so we can give them a check . . . that is a successful day for us. In contrast, every other pitch you ever gonna make is going to somebody that is going to be much worse than us … Customers, they are going to be like — no, I am not going to give you any money — like their default position right? Engineers — you going to try to recruit engineers, and they got 20 other job offers, so why does your pitch is going to be much better than the other 20 startups?”* Marc Andreessen (Y Combinator, 2016, 11:49)

### Inductive behind the scenes

These are the folks that can actually transform their solid ideas in solid proposals that can get accepted. BUt then under the condition of being certain that they can't focus in persuading, they are left with the tools they have. Therefore, they can use critical thinking, and logic, and do the design work, and research, and find data. 

Sometimes a prototype can prove, sometimes a full proof is given, this is the beautiful side, sort of innevitable when effort and intent is high, and when purpose exists, and even in a world where no one understand, if they have resources. But, as likely the by-product of going in that direction, they might also die before they have time to prove, part A. And if that is not enough what can be really tricky is that they may actual do a kind of work that is in a way like what the bad salesperson would do, although no evil is perceived; when they are inserting data enough to prove, although not quite intended as a conscious evil act but as they do, they materialize an evil with no awareness of it, even to a point that does worse than the salesperson that attempts to persuade with no given value offered exactly because that salesperson would be less likely to convince. 

But more than the harm to the business, is that the devotion towards being functional to add proofs exceeds to an extremme where they can't see that they are lying to themselves. As a sidenote to this notion and idea, I seem to be communicator that didn't happen in my youth but that found some traction in the world of user interfaces first, like prototypes, then in the world of high tech companies working with interfaces and prototypes, before I caught myself into the learnings in the world of entrepreneurs. I grew up mad with the bad salesperson - likely made me to be in a denial to the art of communicating well such as to persuade. But then, being decades and decades around software developers, and the young minds like I was, I came to the full realization of how many iterations of software developers were so well crafted, so well promoted, by their shining prototypes; and alltogether the so many instances of those creations that meant nothing, that left as partial prototypes, as ideas projected, illusions too, and illustions that had teased in fact by the shinning and apparent materialization in front of buyers, buyers like customers, investos, and themselves, that had given the buy-in and later cried. Which makes developers a potential worse kind of salesperson that won't even notice when they lie as they lie to themselves by being involved with the perceived materialization of what they had in mind. This day made me happy with the salesperson that mainly deals with what they have to sell and their reputation with the customer as they are to be likely to see the customer in the next day, as they are showing their faces. 

Therefore, the systems-oriented folks enter the induction game too, at another level, by overfocusing in trying to make their paintings to stand, such as my using an excessive amount of nails. Now, if they minimize their willingness to put mails, they are to face the "yet another test" against all the external folks they need help. It's a balance. 





## Executive communication 

Now, any further investment in communication would require a level of awareness to convince ourselves, our colleagues, and future entrepreneurs to join this boat. While we have seen reasons to not ignore, and ideas about how we lower the priority, still a problem to approach the subject is that a lot of resources about communication are oriented to marketing, such as to support positioning of messages, to present better, to improve sales, that sort of line. These invitations are too out of touch with the needs of entrepreneurs which contributes to further lack of interest. 

Fortunately, a responsible proposition exists for entrepreneurs. And here is where we turn our attention to the investor and professor Michael Dearing, of Harrison Metal [^footnote_harrisonmetal], especialy to his special talk entitled Executive Communication (Heavybit, 2019) where he had offered reasons and an overview of the remarkable work of Barbara Minto, Minto Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing, Thinking, & Problem Solving. In this section, we ride along with Michael, to honor that what audiences expect becomes persuasiveness by aspects of communication such as clarity, structure, logic, and substance; and ... 

[^footnote_harrisonmetal]: Instead of trying to describe the viewpoint from Harrison Metal's educational content for entrepreneurs, I took some of the phrases that are shown at the bottom of their web site: Harrison Metal is grateful for the business historians at Harvard Business School, Harrison Metal produces case studies to help businesspeople, Harrison Metal makes everything by hand.

### The hidden cost of poor communication 

The story of how Barbara Minto took herself into writing The Pyramid Principle does justice and highlights the situation where we generally overlook the aspects of communication and turn our attention to something else, like the thoughts being carried by the train, and missing the point that the train matters. 

According to Michael, Barbara was one of the first 20 women admitted to the Harvard Business School in the late 1950s, early 1960s. At a time, the school was 55 years old and already regarded as top tier. If that wasn't enough pressure, that first batch of woman went through a more traditional lecture style in a separate classroom from men - so she had 10 colleagues in her special section. They also had told her that they had to finish in the top 10% in order to earn a second year spot with men across the river. And if that was't enough, Barbara had a subject to deal with macroeconomics while her last math class was 12th grade math. 

But we now may wonder, or dream what would be some of the possibilities in extremme scenarios, as in one that drops everything, or even of the typical smart man that would go with the struggle, perhaps the man of Harvard at the time. But that wasn't Barbara. When Michael asked her "What did you do?" she told him that as she took the textbook and started to prepare her notes, she got really mad. But she had gotten mad because it was badly written because "this person who wrote this textbook was keeping me from understanding this cool topic."

Now when I read this part from Michael's talk, it took me back to the university days when I was studying Computer Science at University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. We all had a sort of sense that it was hard, and part of being at University of Sao Paulo was to deal with that difficult thing. We would never know what we had to go through to go through things. We could only know the amount of hours for the lectures, but the rest was 100% unknown. Then it was too confusing as a lot of the professors had a credibility aroudn the fact that they would be hard. Stories and more stories, like a nightmare. Today, looking backwards, I can see how that "amazing" University of Sao Paulo carries a toxic thing it. While at the same time we sensed truths in it too, like one or other professor that was good in being a teacher, being able to explain things better. But the worse of all is how I took it, to my frustrated life in the University and later on, which was my inclination to never judge the texts. To think I was the one failing. It's never a fault of the text. These folks, they might know how to write. 

No, that was not the view of Barbara. And she went further as "she rewrote it line by line, paragraph by paragraph, page by page until she could teach macro, the basic concepts of macroeconomics to her colleagues in the section." And that is it. That is how Barbara took herself further and went along on her journey to help many people to write in a structured way, to not be creating confusion to others through writing. Barbara Minto not only solved her problems but she unlocked our minds to be able to see that how we see influences what we see, how we get influences what we get. Now even better than that she had positioned the important of focusing, and working, in communication, towards the business world, to the corporations, to managemnt, which is some great executive minds love Barbara's work: 

> *"I worked at the Walt Disney Company for a man named Michael Eisner when he was CEO, and his deep religious conviction was that Barbara Minto had cracked the code on executive communication. He's not alone. If you go around the world and you talk to the most accomplished executive communicators, they are practicing a version of her framework called the Pyramid Principle"* Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019)

For Michael, the work of Barbara "might change your life." And it only gets better the more you get into it. A key point of Barbara's call is the realization that there is a tendency in communication to happens like a narrative which can be associated with deduction, like the work of a detective. 




What comes from that idea of - never touch the communication aspects - is that the idea of poor communication is never related to the actual how communication is conducted, it's mainly discussions abotu the cargo. The view from this angle, can take us in a long ride of not only a denial to the aspects of communication but into spending time, attention, interest, getting frustrated, burning our attention and effort to try to make sense of things, being busy only checking its cargo and not considering that the conduction can be rotten. 



set us to miss the opportunity of using it to achieve clear thinking, which puts us in a complex place of using communication without changing the underlying assumption as if each iteration is an effort to prove ideas with our own proofs - which can be recursive, or nonsensical - or as in one trying to solve communication needs not with one arm but with both arms tied behind their back.  







* Moreover that the very mechanism of translating the systems-based, or value-based, propositions into the solution-oriented mindset, which is the case of these audiences, is the mechanism that helps them to make the value which is not quite ready to be value that is accepted by the ones that will use it. This is a big part of many aspects brought by Michael Dearing points given by his talk Executive Communication. 

* according to Michael, "might change your life." It has changed mine, and has a lot to offer to entrepreneurs to help them to invest in communication, exactly because it works for systems-oriented professionals and, even better, that gives to them a structured path that connects value and where the targets of communications - such as investors, customers, you name it - will be glad, in the first place, to understand the communicative experiences, to follow through, in the first place. 

* Now, this may seem complex because founders think that they know what they are doing, alfter all, they hold vision and the value. But what they can't initially fully grasp is that the interactions with the tests of communication - as indicated in the above section with customers, colleagues, engineers, experts that give feedback, partners, investors and other stakeholders - is the very element that helps them to achieve clarity which supports them to make their visions to fit into the world. 




### The hidden value of great communication 

As we move on with a rationale that sets communication as a highest priority in entrepreneurship, we might first recognize the phenomenon which takes us to miss the point of communication and creates confusion; which may look like an obsession where we see communication as a tool for achieving results, such as a tool to convince, to sell, as if the work with the tool does not yield learning. This view paradoxically rises from the very merit, or the beauty, of great communicative experiences. In other words, it is because communication can be greatly done that we turn out attention to the narratives, or the stories, or the value, being given by communicative experiences. This obsession with the results can set us to miss the entire birthplace of how great communicative experiences can be achieved, the construction of it, how the photo montage matters. As if we enjoy smart kids but ignore the educational process that starts from the early days. This point missed can be experienced from a management view by Peter Drucker in Technology, Management and Society; in the article entitied "Informação, Comunicação e Compreensão":

> *"There is a very old saying among writers: 'Difficulties with a sentence always mean confused thinking. It is not the sentence that needs straightening out, it is the thought behind it. In writing we attempt, of course, to communicate with ourselves. An unclear sentence is one that exceeds our own capacity for perception. Working on the sentence, that is, working on what is normally called communications, cannot solve the problem. We have to work on our own concepts first to be able to understand what we are trying to say - and only then can we write the sentence."* (Drucker, 2011, p. 6)

As we celebrate the phenomenon of missing the point about communication as a tool - as in celebrating a trap from ugency - we can turn our attention to reasons for valuing communication as the executive communication mechanism for getting things done. To recall our context in simple terms, as we have seen [^editornote_reference_prior_growth], the startup evolution as the situation of growth. And the implied necessity of entrepreneurs to use communicative experiences to get help. From who? From any audience that is relevant to what is ahead, such as customers, investors, but above all the team as an initial audience. With that, althought it is already a complex problem, they might find more trouble as they try to control the results, such as to convince the audience. Their job, especially as they engage with the communicative experiences such as writing, should go away from convincing an audience. The risk of going in that urgent direction might lead, or mislead, themselves too - into convincing themselves. Their job, conversely, is first to achieve clarity for the challenge at hand. By first focusing in a responsible communication, the team will develop themselves into a conscious path that will help them to understand their problems and translate the challenges ahead into proposals targeted for collaborators that comes along, such as the team themselves. 

[^editornote_reference_prior_growth]: Growth was presented on the chapter entitled Success, and it's around thoughout other subjects, our assumption of a view where the startup is in a path of evolving through stages and accordingly the necessity that entrepreneurs are learning and executing alltogether in a path of uncertainty, therefore required to grow themselves as individuals and entrepreneurs, to transcend and evolve their roles, thus to be able to see the multiple dimensions, theirselves in the startup, their startup in the context of market, their startup in the context of society, their startup in the context of humanity. 

The celebration that writing is not manipulative does justice first to the team, their time, and invites us to the structured and logical work of Barbara which gives to people an easier and structured way to deal with communication. Her approach is can be especially life-changing for entrepreneurs as they depend, interact, and need support from solutions-oriented audiences.

> *"I had the great privilege 25 years ago to spend three days with her while she coached me, rewriting a three page memo to Michael Eisner about why we should buy Winnie the Pooh for $850 million dollars. I fantasized that when I showed up to the workshop with her, she was going to read my draft and say, "Honey, I can't help you. You're already there." She calls me "Honey." I've heard her call other people "Honey," too. I'm OK with it. But I wish she would only call me "Honey." We spent three days together rewriting this memo and it was a frickin'work of art. She unlocked the door for me."* Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

### Basics of SCqA by Michael 

> "Her framework is in a book called The Pyramid Principle, and I strongly urge you to buy a copy. It's expensive. It's $200 dollars. You should buy it. It's worth it. I will simplify the framework as a teaser so that you go buy the book. The best executive communication for Barbara starts with 'Situation.' The nickname for this is SCQA, or the Pyramid Principle." Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

> "The best executive communication starts with the state of affairs. It's fact based, unambiguous. It's totally not controversial. No matter what side of an issue or a hard choice you're on, you should be able to read the situation and go, 'That pretty much sums it up.' Whether you're on one side or another of an issue, it doesn't matter. You should read the situation and agree to it. Agree that's fair."  Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

> "The next thing that comes out is the complication. A crisp, short statement about what has changed or what's making things harder. What's changed, what's making things harder? The question, the 'Q' falls automatically out of 'S' and 'C' and it's almost always 'What should we do?' You can save yourself a lot of anxiety if you're trying to practice this, if you get hung up on 'Q' it's almost always, 'What should we do?' 'Answer,' 'A,' answer first at the top of a pyramid." Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

> *"Pyramid-shape your evidence underneath it, and it has to resolve the complication 100 %. She is rigorously devoted to this framework. If you go ahead and buy that book, which I recommend you do, and you read it you're going to get halfway into it and go, "She really believes this." I'm here to tell you, she really believes this. Every conversation in her life is an opportunity to SCQA. Friends, loved ones, pets, conversations at the deli counter, everything." Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 

> *"You see "Answer," and then the second row. Those might be why my answer is right, they might be "How" arguments to implement the answer. But they're bolstering the answer. I want to show you an example. Underneath each of those bolstering arguments is the evidence ."* Michael Dearing (Heavybit, 2019) 


### Conclusion 

What can we make of about that thing that is all around? Is this an opportunity for another cry and rant about inductive forces all around us? Well, I wanted to celebrate that induction works, first. But my wish is that we make peace with inductive communication - and to use it responsibly. See, if I keep that last moment of rage, without flowing into these pages, I would perhaps not move on, not grasp a single learning, not take advantage in a conscious way that makes sense for entrepreneurs. This, I caught myself in a situation to bring justice, to the story, to put to the page which is in itself an act of reflective thinking - as Julia Cameron would recommend that too. Perhaps right there, although indeed what they were doing is not nice to people, that thing can be good for me, for us, an opportunity to reflect. Pehaps we can learn with them. Of course, not with the goal of tricking our audiences, with a goal of selling to them as a salesman that lies. But learn that induction is all around and that taming induction is a good investment; minimally so that we can better come out of trouble, to spot trouble. Pèrhasp the moments of trouble won't come in your way exacly like that as life is not always cheesy.
