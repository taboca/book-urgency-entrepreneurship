* Situation - We dismiss communication, favor rationality.

## SCqA review v0.3 

* Subject - Communication is misundertood among entrepreneurs, undervalued or overvalued, like it is persuave and manipulative or it is too complex to bother. The favoring for rationality makes entrepreneurs to use poor communication and miss opportunities, not to convince, but to engage others to collaborate, and to achive clarity for themselves too. Communication, such as persuasiveness, can be used honestly, can help the team to collaborate. 

* Situation - People use writing, said or presented, to create change, to an audience. But the usage of communication in the urgent world, seems to evidence extremmes: Either communication to sell, such as convince; or a communication that ignores communication and overfocus in rational aspects, like proofs, where the data matters. 

* Complication - Communication is misundertood and founders may dislike communications, as it may appear to be used to manipulate, favoring only data, proofs, prototypes, etc. And even if we see that it can be used honestly, seems to be confusing how to approach it as materials of communication might be serving urgent needs, such as to sell, to convince. 

* Question/Answer - What to do? To be in peace, we need to see how and why we dismiss communication investment, why it matters for entrepreneurs, and how to proceed further investment, not because of marketing reasons but because of a rich process where communication serves the purpose of the audiences, starting with the team, but all the other stakeholders. 

* Solution a - How we experience - We generally think undervalue communication, such as persuasiveness, if not to block ourselves of dealing with it, as evil, or manipulative, or it might be style. In front of communication, we rather focus on rational aspects.  Even poor communication can be also inclusive, can be a means to go find the problems, focus on the subject, go straight to rational aspects, like value. Plus, criticism for communication, again, can't do anything as management fears to judge the communication of some, such as harrasment, plus they don't know what to do as communication working for management does not seem to be real, so they don't do anything to help to communicate better in the right way. 

* Solution b - Why it matters - Communication such as persuasiveness exists and is the grease of the rational engine. The lack of skill in the effective communication for audiences leads to overfocus in "supporting with data" which may in extremme cases lead to misleading with data. The growth aspects of the startup can't test and undertstand using narrative style, prefers organized solutions-oriented communication, which has to respect the audience's reason to be there, why it matters for them. 

* Solution c - How to approach - With Executive Communication. The story of Barbara, SCqA, and how Barbara has 'cracked the code of communication, especially for executives. Overview of SCqA and why it has the mechanism that supports the team to organize communication (proposals, documents) with the reader/audience/stakeholder first, where the reader is considered solutions-oriented audiences. Focus that the work of logical communication first does justice to the team's need to achieve clarity, instead of convincing in arbibrary ways, or even with data. Reminder that the powerful mechanism of SCqA has to be used responsibly as it may persuade too. 

## SCqA review v0.2 

* Subject - 

* Situation - People use writing, said or presented, to convince. The urgency to close the gap makes the presenter to skip communication, and just use it, may add arbitrariness, and now help with clarity. Can be ignored by the audiences. 

* Complication - Induction is misundertood, used inrresponsibly, or automatically, from a denial to consider that induction serves the purpose, to add clarity. 
* Question - What to do? Continue to deny and present what is right, and responsible, by ignoring communication? As in all the time proving? 
* Answer - The right is to be in peace with induction, respecting its purpose, and the process of transformation, and clarity, where one adds and build a good structure writing. 
* K1 - it might be style - How it is experienced, it might be style, the deductive mind seens investment in communication as lower, favors value towards what seems rational, logic, data - pulls them to focus on data. We can't see even the true induction, or abuse, if not waste or investment, by the insertion of data. 
* k2 - the inductive machine - The machine is inductive anyway, don't be mad. We need to embrace, it's an inductive world and we need to be responsible to deal with it. Works for a fast track world, transactional, but still how to?
* k3 - The logical horizon. 
* v0.1 -  [ ScqA ] Induction is around, induction attracts. We derive that induction can be used arbitrarily, the complication, abuses. We need to watch out to not fall, and to not comply with; instead consider SCqA.
