Vanessa] who pointed this out as being an 'important step' when Marcio claimed he knows he needs to involve people, and in this sense, found himself lost with a concern of the type 'What if the person is somewhat standardized or professionally mechanical and doesn’t understand the vision behind words that are still underdeveloped, needing refinement'. [feat. Vanessa O.]

## Non-linear yet goal oriented 

### Goal of non-linear 

* Book writing might not be as linear as (I) envisioned. And in fact, I wonder what it is. The non-linear, though, is onto something, which is the something, like a goal or a state, that which is the very thing that pull us to think of a linearity. Some forms related to this goal might be apparent, such as the concrete of publishing. According to Julia Cameron, I think and need to double check, the writing process will take or itself. 

### Goal of a discipline or a networked knowledge 

* In case the book is good - need to be checked - One possibility, other than the default of self-publishing, is to support/grow a network of knowledge, a team, an area of interest around it from the fact of a possible angel investor to act like a producer, which would naturally bring his network, which would open possibilities such as the possibilities to continue the discussion with other groups, with the angel group or investment firm themselves, this to learn and to grow the possibilities from the book beyond the material.
