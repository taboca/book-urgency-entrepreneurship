# Book presentation v3.0 

Slow Down to Startup - by Marcio S. Galli 
Introduction to book, version 3.0, updated May 30th 2024

In short  - In today's fast-paced startup world, the focus is often on speed and execution. But "Slow Down to Start Up" celebrates the importance of taking time - as part of work time - for listening first, reflecting, and developing a conscious view. Management of the entrepreneurial activity isn't a luxury - it's a necessity - especially when we are teased to get things done fast, faster. The price we pay is that we disconnect from a well-being state (as individuals and organizations) and that we can be blocked. We drain our funds, our energy, our creativity, our ability to listen, to reflect, and to grow. The startup path is a path that demands a balanced well-being. 

Audience

It works well for entrepreneurs, senior or early managers, practitioners, investors, and parents too, that care about our kids. The initial target audience is the entrepreneur, who wants to, or is already, in the midst of the startup process as defined by viewpoints such as of Paul Graham where startup equals to growth. This audience is a small segment but they carry the responsibility to make an impact on the world. In the foreword I quote Maslow and his interest in entrepreneurs when he considered that “If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.” We may know that truth but we too overlook the situation when we (our environment) set this potential group into very bad places. In other words, this is the group that gets things done and are remembered but too the group that aren’t when things do not work. And like blocked artists, they too deserve to continue their quest. Perhaps on their second attempt, not trying to control too much, not boosting their performances, perhaps being honest with themselves and doing it in a balanced way. For them, this book supports them, to be conscious, to carry on execution, of course, but maintaining a balanced mindset which is a must in a world that asks them to just do it. 

Why a small audience at this time?

Why not a wider audience? I have decided to keep in the context of entrepreneurs doing startups. A first-time writer, like me, would be tempted to go broad. Fortunately I have learned, from the late William Zinsser, that being specific can, and should, bring a broad and meaningful message. From the narrow to the broader: We depart from the situation that startups are entities, designed for growth. Then we move into the space which demands the growth of the individual, especially given the potential for getting things done as they become powerful. Then we celebrate the powerful role that needs to be a humble role, and how that helps them to transcend from the pressures of the present facing the challenges of the future in better shape. More broadly, conscious and healthy entrepreneurship demands conscious and healthy beings and all of that supports humanity.

Theme (Test, by Chatgpt)

 "The narrative argues that amidst the abundance of solutions and the urgency for results, it is crucial for entrepreneurs to connect with an essence where decisions reflect a thoughtful understanding of their actions and how these ripple through the startup's structure to society at large. Success, therefore, is redefined not as an end - where the ends justify the means - but as the outcome of conscious entrepreneurship that is aligned with the well-being of the entrepreneur, the venture, and society." (ChatGPT, minor style corrections by Marcio)

Introduction - why and structure 

A situation - The abundance of options - or solutions - to make a startup does not appear to be confusing, not initially. A hungry entrepreneur, or team, can run into the hypermarket where there are too many aisles for all the themes and stages of a startup. There, they are teased and can quickly pick all kinds of solutions for their needs: playbooks, tools, frameworks, methodologies, and more. They can subscribe to networks and platforms such as accelerators, incubators, and other interactive experiences from networks. They can be inspired too, by stories. They can have fun. All that is offered offers a nice narrative, richer, that all promises growth. All these off-the-shelf solutions resonate in a way or another with what top-tier investors and growth advisors say, all solutions sound coherent.

A complication - Founders can be lost in abundance, as in lost in translation. And it is not that every single offering is misleading them. The offerings aren’t that smart, or evil in nature as it comes from the richer setting which generally informs us that more and cheaper means potential. The supermarket is just bigger now, and products are mainly cheaper now. This space may set founders to being generalist-specialists too - thinking that they are generalists but eventually following the playbook. This is a path, a setting, that can convey them to move, to act, to run, and then too to burn their most precious resources, their consciousness, their ability to see from above, their ability to do things in a balanced way. 

The plan - A serious founder, a conscious founder, is the path. And it is a must, for a startup intended to grow. A particular finding in this work is that the actual answer for doing it right is everywhere - although not easy to see when we are doing it in urgent mode. In other words, the information is documented, recorded, voiced, said, by top-tier investors, practitioners, methodologies and more. In fact, the good advice is there but it is as in on the back of the products of the shelves - legally or properly informing the shopper of the risks of consumption or how to or what it takes to consume properly with consciousness. But given that the entrepreneur-shopper reads mainly the title, sees the photo, and jumps to use too quick, this book invites the reader to an experience, to read about themselves, about when doing it, to see themselves from the perspective of one in the audience, to consider to break the urgency to grab outcomes. The goal is to improve their awareness about the importance of moving consciously, as individual beings, and how that reflects in the startup and the future of their organizations. 

In the first part, Urgency of the Self, we recognize that we are beings that are first thrown into the field, that we jump into the fast-paced setting of the startup ecosystem, and set ourselves to being driven by the winds (forces of their market, their culture, the economy). The first chapter (Accounting) recognizes the being, the entrepreneur, and what drives them, energy and time, and how they should respect these elements which are essential to the journey. Then we will consider the challenges of us from being to becoming, considering how the movement shapes who we become (Identity), how the environment shapes what we do (Environment) and how our fast-paced approach takes us to run fast but in many situations into being blocked (Running).

In the second part, Urgency of the Team, we look at the characterizations of the fast-paced team that gets busy, doing, and misses the opportunity to see things from perspective. In this context, we start with how urgent things become so urgent (The Feedback of Urgency) to a point of taking us to be controllers and less creative. Then we move to consider the pitfalls of executing a startup with the lean methods where we are taken into a situation of controlling what we do lean (Lean Attention Deficit) and to miss the view of purpose. We end this part (In Peace with Communications) exploring how we misuse communications - as a tool for outcomes - and how we miss the opportunity to use communications in ways that can actually help our teams grow. 

In the third part, Urgency in the System,  we continue to explore other dynamics of the urgent world that affect movements and the steps of our organizations through our culture. We will consider a reflection about the themes of goal-setting (Not so Radical Focus),  or the world driven by narratives (The Narrative Dilemma), and then again consider the dangers of using lean methods without a conscious view (The Lean Dilemma) . 

Origins of work - The Blitzscaling Lectures 

Blitzscaling, the course, has covered many aspects of how to scale a startup. Among possible agendas, one is the actual agenda of Blitzscaling - the growth of a startup according to Blitzscaling - which would naturally position the Blitzscaling leadership team to focus and honor these higher-order aspects. In other words, they need to take care of the big and urgent things first. 

But other agendas exist from there and are not hidden and can be observed with a careful eye. One agenda in particular relates to the identity of these doers, the behavioral aspects, what it takes to be a good entrepreneur. When watching the lectures, I started to notice the possibility of a readiness level in the sense of conditions for growth (of their organizations) to be connected with pre-conditions of the being.  

In other words, we are considering reconciling the model that a) Blitzscaling and startup as growth exists with the situation that b) possibilities are improving in terms of entrance points for people to make startups which continue to grow with the abundance and richness of the modern ecosystems, with c) the special attention that must be paid to self-awareness and conscious entrepreneurship and the said readiness level. 

Since the author started from the realm of entrepreneurship, and not philosophy or psychology, the book carries the reader from a world as it seems, In other words, we start with the "train in movement", an urgent train and the book attempts to carry the reader out of it and in it, thus establishing a reflective thinking, or reflective tour, so that reflections about behaviors can be brought to our attention and a wider context of abstraction is aimed towards conscious entrepreneurship that respects humans.

# Book presentation v2.7 

* Version v2.7
* By Marcio S Galli 
* Title: Slow Down Start Up

# Short descriptions

* Ref - Used for Web Summit. 

* Talk - While the fast-paced, networked world values speed, the leaders of the most iconic, rapidly evolving companies demonstrate something different. They are calmer, avid readers, mindful, and prioritize the well-being of their team.

* Bio - A fast-paced technologist with experience at iconic Silicon Valley companies (Netscape, Yahoo!, and Mozilla) became an entrepreneur. However, he experienced a transformative slowdown, leading to an awakening. This journey inspired his book "Slow Down to Start-Up," aimed at helping founders.

* Slide - teaser - My story would pass by, dismissed, like many of us. But when the struggling situation of transforming a life came about, it also came the light to a lot of dots. I wasn't in it, for me. It was mainly a reflective and journey of curiosity, into Blitzscaling. 

* Slide - The Start-up attempt 10 - 
* Slide - Blitzscaling - 
* Slide - The call to think - Michael. 
* Slide - Time travel - Marcio's fastest typing machine. 
* Slide - Time travel - Marcio's quest to delete the del key. 

## Audience

* Entrepreneurs, managers, practitioners, investors. Note: the initial target audience - while applicable to practitioners, managers, advisors, mentors, and investors - is entrepreneur who wants to, or is already in the midst of the startup process as defined by viewpoints such as of Paul Graham where startup equals to growth. This is the niche context of the book. This context, or audience, represents a relatively small segment globally. But as the pain can be high for this group, such as if they follow instincts, the material of the book might be worth it to exist and it is a reason that the language reaches out to anyone concerned with these doers who are in the field.

## Narrow-to-broad context

About the context, should this book be narrow or aim for a wider audience? I have decided to keep in the context of entrepreneurs doing startups when they think they are going for growth. A first-time writer, like me, would be tempted to go broad. But I have learned from William Zinsser that being specific can be a means to give a broad and meaningful message. Therefore, I start with a startup in a hurry, or better, an entrepreneur in a hurry.

* Narrow focus: Startups are entities designed for growth. This necessitates personal growth.
* Perspective: Emerges the humble entrepreneur, who transcends beyond the pressures of the present.
* Broader: Conscious entrepreneurship is defined as supporting humanity.

## Theme

"The narrative argues that amidst the abundance of solutions and the urgency for results, it is crucial for entrepreneurs to connect with an essence where decisions reflect a thoughtful understanding of their actions and how these ripple through the startup's structure to society at large. Success, therefore, is redefined not as an end - where the ends justify the means - but as the outcome of conscious entrepreneurship that is aligned with the well-being of the entrepreneur, the venture, and society." (ChatGPT, minor style corrections by Marcio)

## SCqA presentation

* Situation - The abundance of options, solutions, to make a startup, does not appear to be confusing. A hungry entrepreneur or team can go to the supermarket where there are aisles for all stages of a startup, where they will find products, services, frameworks, methodologies, platforms, networks. All that is offered is richer, all promises growth, all seem to resonate in a way or another with what top-tier growth advisors say, all solutions seem coherent.

* Complication - Founders can be lost in abundance, or lost in translation. And it is not that every single offering is misleading them. The offerings are just improving and becoming richer. The supermarket is bigger. As founders engage in being generalists like specialists, they might mislead themselves into burning their precious resources, which may also impact the culture.  

* Question - But isn't it that the ecosystem takes care of the cycles of learning? If a founder didn't pass through, they can learn again. Indeed, from the investor view, the best will pass anyway. But what if the actual founder wants to pass? Are there aspects to pay attention to, that could improve the chances to grow and to be around?

* Answer - A serious founder, a conscious founder, is the path. And it is a must, for a startup intended to grow. The answer is everywhere, the information is all around. Investors, practitioners, top tier VC firms, methodologies - all of these products in the hypermarket are informing you of the risks and what it takes to use them. This book invites the reader to break the urge to grab outcomes and improve the awareness of the growth aspects of a startup which starts with the growth of the self.

* Parts - The first part - Behavioral urgency - starts with the recognition that the self is not disconnected from the urgent world such as the startup ecosystem, the market, culture, the economy. It lifts the reflection that the unit of work, the currency in the beginning, starts with an individual energy. It asks us to respect that currency.

* Parts - The second part - Interpersonal urgency - looks to the sides of a founder team, as they develop connections, interactions, in an attempt to network their way up. And into this, conversely, looks at how the urgent world influences the team, with a goal to improve the team's perspective.

* Parts - The third part - Systemic urgency - considers the dynamics of an urgent and hyperconnected world that affects the movements of companies and larger teams. It aims to improve awareness of how communication systems influence people, thus calling for a conscious entrepreneurship that is aware of this interdependence which is vital for growth and growth of humanity.

## Origins of work from Blitzscaling

Blitzscaling, the course, has covered behavioral aspects that support what it takes to a startup to grow, aspects that show aspects of self growth, mainly through the interviews which is undeniably everywhere in materials of the interview-lectures or referred by the participants. From that, multiple possible agendas must exist, such as the agenda of Blitzscaling - the growth of Blitzscaling - which would naturally position the executive team to focus from the macro aspects, as in from the tops-down, although the identity with what it takes to be a good entrepreneur seems to all around.

From the point of view of a learner-entrepreneur, as they start their startups, they won't find behavioral materials which supports a readiness level as human beings that generates a good entrepreneur. As there is no agenda for that, especially if they are biased within the frames of their urge to grow. By that, they may filter solutions in front of them, such as to pull the market of solutions, as in they enter a capsule for growth, which naturally starts with a space of pressure for growth, thus they are subject to leading themselves, or misleading, into the too many topics oriented to growth, included interactions and cycles, natural of the fast-paced networked ecosystem of entrepreneurship which by the way continues to improve in richness with coherent stories. Example a local startup program offers a quite enchanting opportunity that resonates with Silicon Valley top tier programs and even may link to the possibility of networking your way up. All of this is not unlinked from how people work, as in industry behaviors, cultural, economic and social aspects. It is then easy to lose focus on the most precious resource - themselves.  

In other words, Blitzscaling and startup as growth exists. But as the possibilities for people to make startups continue to grow, with the abundance and richness of the modern ecosystem, a special attention must be paid to self-awareness and conscious entrepreneurship. Some of the information from the Blitzscaling properly feeds this perspective and provides a rich support to a readiness level in terms of behaviors which support the growth of founders as doers that think through, conscious entrepreneurs, humble/infinite learners, among other perceived characteristics. In other words, it is as if we have a consciousness gap - perhaps due to the richness of stories for entering the game - where even the folks passing the test don't even know of the readiness state of them as human beings that may have supported them. As if the top-tier entrepreneurs could even take for granted their readiness level in terms of growth as humans. And as for the others that failed, temporarily or not, might also not know that human and behavioral aspects, such as analysis and reflective thinking around anxiety, obsession, instant gratification, following instincts, and the alike, drove them into a path leading to frustration, waste of energy, and failure perceived as real failure.

Although the system of growth responds to that - such as from the point of view of top tier VC firms that may support the winners that somehow passes tests, or in other words that the contest takes care of itself selecting the best - this book is concerned with the individual in a holistic way, from end to end. Which naturally sets a challenge as through this frame we can't see entrepreneurs as expendable, which naturally sets a a frame for the book where growth of a startup is liked to the growth of self as individuals which forms conscious entrepreneurship, which naturally forces a frame where success has to be adjusted and can't be about capturing the prize on done in ways such as where the end justifies the means.

Since the author started from entrepreneurship, and not philosophy or psychology, the book carries the reader from a world as it seems, through the goggles that it is an urgent world that somehow is too rich, which indeed offers possibilities for startups, which also happens to be chaotic, which happens to be a complication through this view exactly as - by the terms of a narrative of a somehow mechanized world - entrepreneurs are likely pushed into being okay with chaos. By starting with the "train in movement", an urgent train, the book attempts to carry the reader to be okay with establishing a reflective thinking, or reflective tour, so that reflections about behaviors can be brought to our attention and a wider context of abstraction is aimed towards conscious entrepreneurship that respects humans.

## Motivations

The effect that I want to provoke, to the reader being them entrepreneurs, managers, practitioners, investors, anyone interested in the startup ecosystem, is not mainly about improving their awareness to the risks of moving quick and reactive in the fast-paced world which promises a lot where one can drive fast because of an abundance of solutions that promises growth. Although this is part of the situation of entrepreneurship which we start from, I want the reader to consider that the possibility of transcendence - such as the development of their enlightened entrepreneur and willingness to do so - is reduced in the face of present needs which gets in the way, such as the willingness to do right, to achieve success, to pursue outcomes. The point being is that this transcendence, self growth, is critically necessary to move into growth. In other words, startups depend on growth for the whole system and growth of their constituents, the individuals doing it. Although learning and execution is generally recognized by entrepreneurs, urgency leads to learning in retrospect while leadership in entrepreneurship, or conscious entrepreneurship, involves the development of a humble mindset that sets the entrepreneur as a doer and apprentice, where they are required to transcend the urgency of now, and embrace change, such as one that recognizes that "what gets you here is not what takes you there."

## On writing stages

* Recent stage: episode 69 in a row, 2-3h per day, except weekends or time off, happening from July 2023. It has shown to Marcio a hint of what is really to be a writer. Unclear to say when the manuscript will be ready, ready for a different fight; but it is clear that the writing seems to be taking care of itself, as in convergence happening, clarity, reviews from wider perspective, and the early contact writings to potential supporters like editors, reviewers, advisors, and more.

* Origin: fuzzy, unclear, through the Blitzscaling learnings, around 2017.
