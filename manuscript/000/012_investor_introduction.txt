Disclaimer: This brief overview is highly subject to changes. This is due to richer or clear views that are acquired from the process of doing it, and from the process of reading it. In other words, the author achieves more clarity about the impact as he builds, as he listens, as the material improves. 

Overview 

In today's fast-paced startup world, the focus is often on speed and execution. But "Slow Down to Start Up" celebrates the importance of taking time - as part of startup work time - for listening, reflecting, and developing a conscious view about what happens. Management of the entrepreneurial activity isn't a luxury - it's a necessity - especially now that we are asked to get things done fast, faster, by the environment around us. The price we pay, for running first thinking later, is that we grow a disconnection from our beings, and our well-being state (as individuals and organizations) which can cause us to be confused and blocked:. We drain our funds, our energy, our creativity, our ability to listen, to reflect, and therefore to grow. Slow Down to Startup is a reflective moment that sets us to be conscious that the startup path is a path that demands a balanced well-being before making a well-balanced organization being. 

Audience

Entrepreneurs, senior and junior managers, practitioners, investors, parents of founders, and whoever cares about the next generation. The initial target audience is the entrepreneur, who wants to, or is already, involved in the startup process; as defined by the viewpoint of Paul Graham where startup equals to growth. Although everyone deserves a moment of reflection about the fast-paced world, this group carries the responsibility to make an impact on the world. In the foreword, I quote Maslow and his interest in entrepreneurs when he considered that “If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.” We may know that truth but we too overlook the situation when we (by our environment) set them into bad places, when we think of them as expendable. We shouldn’t, exactly because this is the group that gets things done and are remembered, when things work, we should be with them to support them for when things do not work. Like blocked artists, they deserve to continue their quest. And the fast-paced world is an invitation to be blocked. This material will not only help the ones that are partially blocked - on the way - but even the ones that are starting and can do it in a healthier way. We help them to, not try to control too much, to carry on their well-being, and to move by being honest with themselves - doing it in a balanced way. 

Why a small audience at this time?

Why not a wider audience? A first-time writer, like me, would be tempted to go broad. Fortunately I have learned, from the late William Zinsser, that being specific can, and should, bring a broad and meaningful message. From the narrow to the broader: We start with startups in a journey for growth, and how these individuals are involved by the external world ( that gives them the means and the end) but too, given the richness of the hyperconnected environment - platforms and methods and tools - to a great extent tells them when to do, what to do, how to do, and thus influencing the why to do. Being conscious when doing it, can save the being, the individuals, the team, the culture, and their future. The broad message follows from conscious entrepreneurship - says that conscious and healthy entrepreneurship demands conscious and healthy beings and all of that supports humanity.

Theme (Test, by Chatgpt)

 "The narrative argues that amidst the abundance of solutions and the urgency for results, it is crucial for entrepreneurs to connect with an essence where decisions reflect a thoughtful understanding of their actions and how these ripple through the startup's structure to society at large. Success, therefore, is redefined not as an end - where the ends justify the means - but as the outcome of conscious entrepreneurship that is aligned with the well-being of the entrepreneur, the venture, and society." (ChatGPT, minor style corrections by Marcio)

Introduction - why and structure 

A situation - The abundance of options - or solutions - to make a startup does not appear to be confusing, not initially. A hungry entrepreneur, or team, can run into the hypermarket where there are too many aisles for all the themes and stages of a startup. There, they are teased and can quickly pick all kinds of solutions to satisfy their needs: playbooks, tools, frameworks, methodologies, and more. In addition, they subscribe to networks and platforms such as accelerators, incubators, and other interactive experiences being involved with networks and collaboration. For every single interaction point, they can be quite enchanted, inspired, motivated. All narratives of all products and solutions are compelling, and getting better, becoming richer. They certainly will have fun, especially if they want to do it that way. All that is offered offers the promise for growth. All these off-the-shelf solutions resonate in a way or another with what top-tier investors and growth advisors say, all solutions sound coherent.

A complication - Founders can be lost in this rich and abundant world, lost in translation. And it is not that every single offering is misleading them. The offerings aren’t evil in nature. These touch points are just evolving. The supermarket is just bigger now, and products are cheaper now, and their messages are coherent. This space may even set our founders into being generalist-specialists - when a generalist mindset is also given by playbooks. This is a path, a setting, that can convey them to move, to act, to run, but also to burn their most precious resources. They can become less conscious, they may miss the opportunity to see from above, and they may miss an ability to do things in a balanced way. 

The plan - A serious founder, a conscious founder, is the path. And that is a must if they are serious about a startup intended to grow. A particular finding in this work is that the actual answer for doing it right is everywhere, although not easy to see when they are doing things in urgent mode. In other words, the good information is documented, recorded, said, by top-tier investors, practitioners, methodologies, and more. Although good advice exists everywhere, it may be perceived as in “on the back of  product covers.” In other words, in the setting that a team is in a hurry, they might operate as in reading briefly the title, sees the photo, and jumps to use things too quickly. Things like Lean methods for example. Given this context, this book invites the reader to a reflective experience that involves looking at themselves, doing, what happens, to see themselves from perspective. The goal is to improve their awareness about the importance of moving consciously, as individual beings, and how that supports the organization being. . 

The overview of parts: 

In the first part, Urgency of the Self, we recognize the self first, the being, and how our initial movement starts from the movement first. The first chapter (Accounting) recognizes the being, from inside the entrepreneur, and other two essential elements to the journey - energy and time. In Identity, we consider that from the movement of being, getting things done, towards becoming successful, they carry on characteristics that may define them, as in superpowers, but also create demands for responsibility and awareness. Next, in Environment, we consider how the fast-paced environment sets so many building blocks, by systems of technology and social connections, that sets them what to do, how to do, and why to do it. We end part one with Running, where we consider how the movement to get things done, and doing things the right way (as defined by the fast-paced environment) causes them to be blocked. 

In the second part, Urgency of the Team, considering characterizations of the fast-paced team, we dive into how urgent things become urgent (The Feedback of Urgency). We dig into the feedback systems, based on values, that supports urgent things; while the unknown lacks value support system and can	‘t compete. It’s a reflection of how the controller's characterization rises in front of the flexible and creative state. Next, in Lean Attention Deficit, we look at the use of  Lean methods where teams misses the view from above, or view of purpose, again by falling into controlling lean or by a strict devotion to lean, taking them into blocked situations - to even doubt lean, to be frustrated, to enter wrong pathways into lean and change product or vision, and more. We end this part (In Peace with Communications) exploring how we tend to use communications - as a tool speeding up results as in to sell outcomes as opposed to a communication that can be honest, and conscious, and can make the team and everyone involved to collaborate better across all stages. 

In the third part, Urgency in the System,  we reflect about the ongoing conversations given by goal-setting systems, like OKR, in Not so Radical Focus. Then, in The Narrative Dilemma, we dive into a world of narratives and how we overlook the aspect that we might be Homo Narrans in the first place, and using visceral narratives to affect our pace, our views, by the hour; thus not being conscious about how we use and are used by ongoing narratives given by ourselves, our colleagues, our systems, and the whole environment. Then we go back to Lean, in The Lean Dilemma, to conclude about the must needed balance of running a grown-oriented organization using any systems that promises faster results. 

Origins of work - The Blitzscaling Lectures 

Blitzscaling, the course, has covered many aspects of how to scale a startup. Among possible agendas, one might be the main agenda of Blitzscaling - which focused on the growth of a startup according to Blitzscaling. In other words, the Blitzscaling leadership team had to focus and honor these higher-order aspects. 

But other agendas exist from there and can be observed with a careful eye. One agenda in particular relates to the identity of these doers, the behavioral aspects, what it takes to be a good entrepreneur. When watching the lectures, I started to notice the possibility of a readiness level in the sense of conditions of the human being as key conditions for growth of their organizations.

With that, and considering that a) Blitzscaling and/or startup growth is real, and b) the environment for startup opportunity continues to grow with the abundance and richness of the modern ecosystems, it is then configured an complication, and an opportunity, for supporting founders by giving a special attention to self-awareness and that said readiness level - as human beings - in connection with the conscious entrepreneurship as an element that can support success further. 

Since the author started from the realm of entrepreneurship, and not philosophy or psychology, the book carries the reader from a world as they know, firstIn other words, most of the chapters recognize the world as seen, or that train in movement, first. Therefore, the book’s attempt is to carry the reader out of that inertial movement, by establishing a reflective thinking, or reflective tour, aimed to help with perspective, with behaviors, towards the conscious entrepreneurship that connects with the being - does not leave behind the being.
