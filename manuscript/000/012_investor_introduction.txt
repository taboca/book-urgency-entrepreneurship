The narrative argues that amidst the abundance of solutions and the urgency for results, it is crucial for entrepreneurs to connect with an essence where decisions reflect a thoughtful understanding of their actions and how these ripple through the startup's structure to society at large. Success, therefore, is redefined not as an end - where the ends justify the means - but as the outcome of conscious entrepreneurship that is aligned with the well-being of the entrepreneur, the venture, and society.

## SCqA presentation 

* Situation - The abundance of options, solutions, to make a startup, does not appear to be confusing. A hungry entrepreneur or team can go to the supermarket where there are aisles for all stages of a startup. Products, services, frameworks, methodologies, platforms, networks - all is richer and richer, all supports growth. 

* Complication - Founders can be lost in abundance, or lost in translation. And it is not that every single offering is misleading them. The offerings are just improving and becoming richer. The supermarket is bigger. As founders engage in being generalists like specialists, their might mislead themselves into burning their precious resources, which may also impact the culture.  

* Question - But isn't it that the ecosystem takes care of the cycles of learning? If a founder didn't pass through, they can learn again. Indeed, from the investor view, the best will pass anyway. But what if the actual founder want to pass? Are there aspects to pay attention that could improve the chances to grow and to be around? 

* Answer - A serious founder, a conscious founder, is the path. And it is a must, for a startup intended to growth. The answer is everywhere, the information is all around. Investors, practitioners, top tier VC firms, methologies - all of these products in the hypermarket are informing you of the risks and what it takes to use them. This book invites the reader to break the urgent to grab outcomes and improve the awareness for the growth aspects of a startup which starts with the growth of the self. 

* Parts - The first part - Behavioral urgency - starts with the recognition that the self is not disconnected from the urgent world such as the startup ecosystem, the market, culture, the economy. It lifts the reflection that the unit of work, the currency in the beginnings, starts with an individual energy. It asks us to respect that currency. 

* Parts - The second part - Interpersonal urgency - looks to the sides of a founder team, as they develop connections, interactions, in an attempt to network their way up. And into this, conversely, looks at how the urgent world influences the team, with a goal to improve the team's perspective. 

* Parts - The third part - Systemic urgenty - considers the dynamics of an urgent and hyperconnected world that affects the movements of companies and larger teams. It aims to improve awareness of how communication systems influences people, thus calling for a conscious entrepreneurship that is aware of this interdependence which is vital for growth and growth of humanity. 

## Origins of work from Blitzscaling 

The Blitzscaling, the course, has covered behavioral aspects that supports what it takes to a startup to grow, aspects that shows aspects of self growth, mainly through the interviews which is undeniably everywhere in materials of the interview-lectures or referred by the participants. From that, multiple possible agendas must exist, such as the agenda of Blitzscaling - the growth of Blitzscaling - which would naturally position the executive team to focus from the macro aspects, as in from the top-down, although the identity with what it takes to be a good entrepreneur seems to all around. 

From the point of view on a learner-entrepreneur, as they start their startups, they won't find behavioral materials which supports a readiness level as human beings that generates a good entrepreneur. As there is no agenda for that which especially if they are biased within the frames of their urge to growh. By that, they may filter solutions in front of them, such as to pull the market of solutions, as in they enter a capsule for growth, which naturally starts with a space of pressure for growth, thus they are subject to leading themselves, or misleading, into the too many topics oriented to growth, included interactions and cycles, natural of the fast-paced networked ecosystem of entrepreneurship which by the way continues to improve in richness with coherent stories. Example a local startup program offers a quite enchanting opportunity that resonates with Silicon Valley top tier programs and even may link to the possiliby of networking your way up. All of this is not unlinked from how people work, as in industry behaviors, cultural, economic and social aspects. It is then easy to lose focus on the most precious resource - themselves.  

In other words, Blitzscaling and startup as growth exists. But as the possibilities for people to make startups continues to growth, with the abundance and richness of the modern ecosystem, a special attention must be paid to self-awareness and conscious entrepreneurship. Some of the information from the Blitzscaling properly feed this perspective and provides a rich support to a readiness level in terms of behaviors which support the growth of founders as doers that think through, conscious entrepreneurs, humble/infinite learners, among other perceived characteristics. In other words, it is as if we have a consciousness gap - perhaps due to the richness of stories for entering the game - where even the folks passing the test don't even know of the readiness state of them as human beings that may have supported them. As if the top-tier entrepreneurs could even take for granted their readiness level in terms of growth as humans. And as for the others that failed, temporarily or not, might also not know that human and behavioral aspects, such as analysis and reflective thinking around anxiety, obsession, instant gratification, following instincts, and the alike, drove them into a path leading to frustration, waste of energy, and failure perceived as real failure. 

Although the system of growth responds to that - such as from the point of view of top tier VC firms that may support the winners that somehow passes tests, or in other words that the contest takes care of itself selecting the best - this book is concerned with the individual in a holistic way, from end to end. Which naturally sets a challenge as through this frame we can't see entrepreneurs as expendable, which naturally sets a a frame for the book where growth of a startup is liked to the growth of self as individuals which forms conscious entrepreneurship, which naturally forces a frame where success has to be adjusted and can't be about capturing the prize on done in ways such as where the end justifies the means. 

Since the author started from entrepreneurship, and not philosophy or psychology, the book carries the reader from a world as it seems, through the goggles that it is an urgent world that somehow is too rich, which indeed offers possibilities for startups, which also happens to be chaotic, which happens to be a complication through this view exactly as - by the terms of a narrative of a somehow mechanized world - entrepreneurs are likely pushed into being okay with chaos. By starting with the "train in movement", an urgent train, the book attempts to carry the reader to be okay with establishing a reflective thinking, or reflective tour, so that reflections about behaviors can brought to our attention and a wider context of absctraction is aimed, towards conscious entrepreneurship that respects humans.

## Motivations 

The effect that I want to provoke, to the reader - being them entrepreneurs, managers, practitioners, investors, anyone interested in the startup ecosystem - is not about improving their awareness of risks of moving too fast into the fast-paced world that promises a lot where one can drive fast because of an abundant world of possibilities. Although this is part of the situation of entrepreneurship which we start from, I want the reader to consider that the possiblity of transcendence - such as the development of their enlighted entrepreneur and willingness to do so - is reduced in the face of present needs which gets in the way, such as the willingness to do right, to achieve success, to pursue outcomes. The point being is that this transcendence is critically necessary to move into growth. In other words, startups depends on growth for the whole system and growth of the self, the indidivuals in it. Although learning and execution is generally recognized by entrepreneurs, urgency leads to learning in retrospect while leadership in entrepreneurship, or conscious entrepreneurship, involves the development of a humble mindset that sets the entrepreneur as a doer and apprentice, where they are required to transcend the urgency of now, and embrace change, such as one that recognizes that what gets you here is not what takes you there.
