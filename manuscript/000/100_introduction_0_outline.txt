## V2.6 Strategy, abstract, subject, and SCqA 

* Strategy - Avoid - Not touch on transcendence, such as the pratical transcendence that could be linked to creative destruction of the self - was touched on foreword. (kl-050.3)
* Strategy - Avoid - Don't dig into supermarket of abundance details. (kl-050.2)
* Strategy - Evolve - From supermarket, reach out to expendable. (kl-100.)

* Abstract - introduction - The need to break the "ongoing conversation" of the corporate world as a train that affects how we work, and also has mechanized the entrepreneurial behavior. Situation is that if try to stop the train, is bad or slow, as opposed to urgent and fast. Complication is that urgent models defines our behaviors. Let's introduce abundance of current platform - with data, and tools and systems - supports mechanized cognition. With limited attention span as culturally accepted (foreword has covered this). With growth systems which enlarges risks. Reasons for moving forward is awareness, conscious entrepreneurship. Part 1,2,3. 
 
* Subject - There is an "ongoing conversation" and an "ongoing train" in the corporate world - one that is fast, urgent, frenetic, or fast paced. Even for entrepreneurs, which are generally required to be generalists, they find themselves onto certain tracks when engage to execute their startups. These tracks show on their ways, like train tracks, calls for urgent and fast paced approach to entrepreneurship; which can prevent them to see how to be effective managers of their entrepreneurial effort.  

* Situation - Culture intro - Entrepreneurs falls in traps as they navigate the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, or the fast-paced culture of entrepreneurship. Ongoing conversation is real. Narratives are real. Such as failing. Well, falling is not even perceived as trap but as part of the equation, to fail and learn, or to learn fast. So, right there, after a fail, no time to reflect. But the situation is that the generalist mindset can run as a mechanized approach to entrepreneurship in the face of the urgent, frenetic, fast-paced, world of entrepreneurship; where being faster is coherent and goes well with good reasons to move fast, such as access to knowlege, role models, stories, methodologies, data, and support systems such as investors and other systems for scaling. 

* Complication - The complication is that a lot of models exist to help, like lean methologies which are strong, but it is undeniable that in the fast-paced setting, or when attention span is limited, and pressure for growth is present, entrepreneurs might be trapped - not by the tools but - by themselves, as they fail to reflect, to judge, to see from above, to shock-absorb their behaviors, to revisit and review how they are managers of entrepreneurship. 

* Support - kl-100.1 - As individuals, we are compelled in an action machine, the specialist mode for all areas, the world of work. Thus a language of action, a train that can't lose momentum, is not only need for hurry with; but it is connected with data/information abundance, tools abundance and platform systems. These are resources that git into coherent stories of action. 

* Support - kl-100.2 - We face the pressure also from peers, as we move into tribes. We have pressure as systems and supporting growth models too. We deny respecting peers. 

* Support - We have mechanized decision with data, tools, and systems. Thinking that they are moving into the next stage. Example, as in foreword we had "shop for solutions", Michael points "out the shelf" actions like "Hiring people" check blitzscaling talk. There is no way, time, to keep management open, to think how they are doing, as urgency drives them to deliver, to focus in what. Breaks them from breaking the norm of excitement which breaks them to unfold the "moving across" of Michael.
