* [x] Friends - Jorge Henrique, Jow, helped with the digging bringing that Lion King is Hamlet, that Hamlet becoming Hamlet is a struggle, perhaps to a certain extent, transcending. This gave me support to go dig for understanding that scene of the Lion King (Simba and his father the ghost.) All this goes along with the be and not to be and also a synchronicity point is that English from Britain has changed after USA colonization. https://chatgpt.com/share/cc0f0c63-5cba-44ae-a78a-5d531cd0915d

It is with immense appreciation that I dedicate these words to those who took me to advance the materials that have created this book. First, to Vanessa Oliveira, whose sensibility and vision continuously helps me to restructure the tracks I have laid, with a smile and less worried. As an example, she has seen that the prior acknowledgment section seemed to be an article. So then, I made it into the chapter in part two - Expressing gratitude. 

The experience of - I hate to say virtually - meeting investor Michael Dearing was a landmark. His lecture, entitled Michael Dearing on Capitalism, Creativity, was a turning point that motivated me to reflect on what it means to be an entrepreneur and the importance of management. 

I thank John Lilly from the Blitzscaling crew, and all those involved in the Blitzscaling course. The structure of the lectures, and the pace of it as interviews, helped me to understand the readiness levels that it takes for entrepreneurs before they can be in charge of accelerating. I also thank Fred Filho, Elderclei Reami, and Rael Gugelmin, who helped in the subtitle translation work we did as volunteers. 

For feedback, through the moment of first reading with annotations, exposing emotions, Rodrigo Silva. 

To Barbara Minto and Limarc Ambalina that had given to be a good energy to trust and to think through and to be a writer when faced with the excitement to use AI tools for writing. 

For supporting of research and enriching content with data from the world of narratives and history, Jorge Oliveira. 

For feedback while writing, I would like to thank Fabricio Zuardi, who gave me the book "It Does Not Have to be Crazy at Work", and Andre Figueiredo for his willingness to read early drafts and commenting. For supporting research work, Emilio Palma. 

For support for the growth of a management perspectice: Melissa and Jonathan, ex-colleagues from Mozilla network that had shipped to me their great book, How F4(ked Up Is Your Management) and important feedback and support of my path as a learner of management. 

Finally, I thank you, the reader, for participating in this exploration about personal and business growth. Every chapter ahead had to do with puzzles I had to get in, as part of a journey. Thus, I rather see them as invitation for reflections, for a discussion, a conversation, a walk. To you, my sincerest gratitude.

To my good friends, Elder Reami, Christian Guimarães, Roger Soares, Robson Butaca, and their patience for listening to unclear thoughts thorugh decades.
