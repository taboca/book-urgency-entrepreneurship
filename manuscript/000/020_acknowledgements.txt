# Acknowledgements

It is with immense appreciation that I dedicate these words to those who have propelled the creation of this book. First of all, Vanessa Oliveira, whose vision allowed for a restructuring to begin by changing the location of the old acknowledgment section which is now situated in part 3 in "The act of saying thanks and the reflective process".

The experience of virtually meeting investor Michael Dearing was a landmark. His lecture on creative destruction and management was a turning point that motivated me to reflect better on what it means to be an entrepreneur and the note-taking process that initiated this book.

I thank John Lilly, former CEO of Mozilla, and all those involved in the Blitzscaling course. The Blitzscaling classes were fundamental to understanding that accelerating often requires a conscious slowdown. Here, this concept is explored in the context of the individual - you, the entrepreneur of your life. I also thank friends Fred Filho, Elderclei Reami, and Rael Gugelmin, who helped in the initial translation of some of the Blitzscaling lectures.

Finally, I thank you, the reader, for participating in this exploration about personal and business growth. Every inflection point in my journey is an invitation for profound reflections on our own. To all, my sincerest gratitude.
