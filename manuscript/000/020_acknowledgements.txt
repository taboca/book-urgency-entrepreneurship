It is with immense appreciation that I dedicate these words to those who took me to advance the materials that have created this book. First, to Vanessa Oliveira, whose sensibility and vision continuously helps me to restructure the tracks I have laid, with a smile and less worried. As an example, she has seen that the prior acknowledgment section seemed to be an article. So then, I made it into the chapter in part two - Expressing gratitude. 

The experience of - I hate to say virtually - meeting investor Michael Dearing was a landmark. His lecture, entitled Michael Dearing on Capitalism, Creativity, was a turning point that motivated me to reflect on what it means to be an entrepreneur and the importance of management. 

I thank John Lilly from the Blitzscaling crew, and all those involved in the Blitzscaling course. The structure of the lectures, and the pace of it as interviews, helped me to understand the readiness levels that it takes for entrepreneurs before they can be in charge of accelerating. I also thank Fred Filho, Elderclei Reami, and Rael Gugelmin, who helped in the subtitle translation work we did as volunteers. 

Finally, I thank you, the reader, for participating in this exploration about personal and business growth. Every chapter ahead had to do with puzzles I had to get in, as part of a journey. Thus, I rather see them as invitation for reflections, for a discussion, a conversation, a walk. To you, my sincerest gratitude.
