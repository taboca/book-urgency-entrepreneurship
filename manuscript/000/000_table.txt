* @todo - p1 ( ) - Strategic - In Success -  The following quote is from Dorothea Brandy from 1936, page 14, of Wake Up and live, there is a concept which may be applicable to the section Success: "Now this is something which we seldom see at once. Because we commonly think of failure as the conventional opposite of success, we continue to make false antithesis of the qualities which attend success and failure. Success is bracing, active, alert; so the typical attitude of failure, we believe, must be lethargy, inertia, a supine position. True enough; but that does not mean that no energy is being used. Let any psychologist tell you how much energy a mature person must expend to resist motion. A powerful struggle must be waged against the forces of life and movement in order to remain inert, although this struggle takes place so far beneath the surface of our lives that we do not always become aware of it. Physical inaction is no true sign that life-force is not being burned away. So even the idler is using fuel while they dream." (Brande, Dorothea., 2014/1936, p.14) @meta-refid 1212-2323-8838-4848

* @todo - p1 (Done) - In Success or Impact - Dorothea Brande's insight for success; Quote from p.43 of Wake up and Live: "That is the mental picture we make of the trial and error method of learning. Roughly, it is right, but it omits to emphasize one element of the process which, although we may not dwell upon it intentionally, is never forgotten by the Unconscious: the element of pain. We believe, or speak and write as though we believed, that the one success remains as the total residue of the series of attempts, and that it cancels from our minds all the failures which went before it. We do not take into account the tremendous importance to our future conduct of those discarded trials which ended in failure. We succeed at last, it is true; but meanwhile we experience failure, sometimes ridicule, sometimes real pain, sometimes grave humiliation. We by no means retain in our memories only the item of the final success, nor does the success operate to make the failures and pain unimportant to our Unconscious." @meta-refid 1222-9393-9393-4444

* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Foreword vs. Introduction - Reconcile the point of abundance from capitalism with the confusion of information. Check foreword_world check "Therefore, we are in a paradoxal situation. Because despite the turbulence and potential confusion, we have so much more information and tools of unquestionable quality in front of us, more accessible and cheaper. This should be a factor that promotes an optimistic view, for better chances. And if you dig, it is quite rational as we must agree that we now have much more data, more stories, more references, more tools, more means of interaction, more for growth, and even more. In this regard, we should consider the optimistic view from A16Z, the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley, for where we are going: > "We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life." > (Andreessen, 2023)" @meta-refid 1222-3334-8884-9999

* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Part One, Impact - A note, consideration for an insight to be used within the chapter entitled Impact. When writing Morning Pages, I have considered an insight, an idea that aligns with what Dorothea Brande said which perhaps aligns with that path that we get in line with what she called The Will to Fail. But I think I came upon another perspective for the same truth, which is that we're unwilling to kill our lions when it is time to reset ourselves into growth. Thus, it is not that we accept death, as in that we guide ourselves to the death slowly, as in pushing ourselves slowing from the cliff. But, in alignment with her thinking, we may accept death or the Will to Fail as we do not accept to reborn again, reinvent ourselves again, to be open again, to make mistakes again, and that's basically maybe there is an alignment with being naked, an idea from Steve Jobs, and also correlates with the Raw Fear ideas from Doug Leone. This idea may be supportive to our chapter Impact because it may have a correlation with the story from Michael Dearing (Harriet and scaling model). @meta-refid 1234-4354-7474-8383

* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Environment, Bundle and Unbundle - #unbundle #bundle #vertical-to-horizontal. Andy Grove, in Only the Paranoid Survive, considers that through the 80-90s the computing industry went through changes in its structure, from the vertical solutions to a technology that directly sold horizontally. This may be well a case of a industry-wide unbundling phenomenon. A potential quote from an article [1] : "The landscape, however, shifted with advances in microprocessors – technology to put “what before had been many chips on one single chip”. Once microprocessors “became the basic building block of the industry, … manufacturing computers became extremely cost-effective”. Old vertical structures began to erode. By the mid- 90s, people could select from “ready-to-use applications off the shelf” that mixed-and-matched different chipmakers, computer manufacturers and operating systems. Sales and distribution channels, likewise, diversified and proliferated." https://athenarium.com/only-the-paranoid-survive-andy-grove/.

The healthy infant or child, just Being, as *part* of his Being, is randomly, and spontaneously curious, exploratory, wandering, interested. Even when he is non-purposeful, non-copying, expressively, spontaneous, not motivated by any deficiency of the ordinary sort, he tends to try out his powers, to reach out, to be absorbed, fascinated, interested, to play, to wander, to manipulate the world. *Exploring*, *manipulating*, *experiencing*, being interested, choosing, delighting, enjoying, can all be seen as attributes of pure Being, and yet lead to Becoming, though in a serendipitous way, fortuitously, unplanned, unanticipated. Spontaneous creative experience can and does happen without expectations, plans, foresight, purpose, or goal." (Maslow, 2011, p. 43).  Reference - Maslow, A. H. (2011).

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Running, Fear, Grown Up Situation - This is supporting note from Dorothea Brande, exploring the thesis that we are goog in investing time to the failure path. "When failure comes about through devoting precious hours to time-killing pursuits, we can all see that energy is being diverted from its proper channel. But there are ways of killing time which do not look like a dissipation. They can seem, on the contrary, like conscientious and dutiful hard work, they often draw praise and approval from onlookers, and arouse a sense of complacency in us. It is only by looking more closely, by discovering that this work gets us nowhere, that it both tires us and leaves us unsatisfied, that we see here again energy is being devoted to the pursuit of failure."

The goal of identity seems to be simultaneously an end goal in itself and also a transitional goal, a rite of passage, a step along the path to the transcendence of identity. This is like saying its function is to erase itself, put the other way about, if our goal is the Eastern one of ego-transcendence and obliteration, of leaving behind self-consciousness and self-observation, of fusion with the world and identification with it, of homonomony, then it looks as if the best path to this goal for most people is via achieving identity, a strong real self, and via basic need gratification rather than via asceticism."

* @todo - p2 ( ) In Identity or In Environment - Consider the note from Maslow from Toward the Psychology of Being which may support something that "we know" from inside about the dependency from others. He wrote, in p. 48-49, "If this is also if the child himself must finally make the choice by which he grows forward, since only he can know his subjective delight experience, then how can we reconcile this ultimate necessity for trust in the inner individual with the necessity for help from the environment? For he does need help. Without help he will be too frightened to dare. How can we help him to grow? Equally important, how can we endanger his growth? The opposite of the subjective experience of delight, trusting himself so far as the child is concerned, is the opinion of other people. Love, respect, approve, admiration, reward from others, trusting others rather than himself. Since others are so important and vital for the helpless baby and child, fear of losing them, as providers of safety, food, love, respect, etc., is primal, terrifying danger. Therefore, the child, faced with the difficult choice between his own delight experience and the experience of approval from others, must generally choose approval from others and then handle his delight by repression or letting it die, or not noticing it or controlling it by willpower." @meta-refid 1234-8585-9595-9595

* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Environment - An observation, after reading Maslow's Toward a Psychology of Being, that must influence the chapter entitled Environment has been considered by Marcio today when writing his morning pages. It turns out that the whole chapter entitled Environment may be perceived by the audience as a chapter that suggests an environment that is not friendly to the forward movement of entrepreneurs. To some extent it is true and it is Marcio's intention to do it that way given that his work or point of view starts from the reference point that there is just enough or too much part of an abundant world. Far too many options that suggests that everything and all the means and all the building blocks in the environment are actually given in the sense of good givens and optimistic building blocks for building. Because of a potential reaction that being pessimistic or negativist is bad for entrepreneurship, it should be given in the very chapter in the beginning and likely in the end to remind the audience of the importance of being fine and being calm and being reflective about the potential traps in the environment and likely that many of these traps are never traps which gives us the understanding that everything and failures that we do in the end will also serve and will fill a certain well, the well of failures enabling us to learn. But exactly because being too comfortable failing and failing again is a means to learn, it's a potential concern, the awareness for the whole environment becomes important. In the end, Marcio's goal is to set entrepreneurs to be just okay. It is the environment, it is what we have, it is what brought us here, but it doesn't have to be exactly the environment telling every single step we should do in terms of what to do, how to do and why to do.

Option A "In an interview given to Brad Stone, DePaschoale the then-chairman Taxi Magic, had recognized that "Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably." DePaschoale had given to us the feeling of how the perspective is felt when you are there, in the road, in front of cross-roads, where you can't embrace all and have to take a path. But given that an experienced person like De Pasquale, that were actually involved in the business that had achieved a certain level of maturity, to even use the word bet, it reveals not only the multiple potential bets in place, but that these were in fact different strategies or perspectives, as in theses, more than anything related with gambling. In other words, his phrasing that reveals a certain degree of humility, is not enough to hide the well-informed characteristizations of their strategies." And option B is "In an interview with the chairman of Taxi Magic, De Pasquale, his recognition that Uber made a risky bet that has paid off unbelievably, had much less to do with innocence or lack of professionalism and more in terms of revealing the size of the challenge they were onto. Given the experience of a professional like De Pasquale, quite involved in that business that had reached to a certain extent a level of maturity, to even use the word bet is more to do with the humbling spirit that went along the more these leaders get into the growth potential in a space where uncertainty is maintained at the proportion of the potential they unleash." / @meta-refid 1223-3321-2323-3344

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Communication - Consider a quote from Barbara Minto, from page 73, Introduction to Part 2, Logical Thinking: "The tendency to list appears to be universal, and as a technique for getting a rough approximation of your thinking out where it can be looked at critically, it is fine. The trick is not to stop there, but to go further to make sure that the ideas in each grouping actually possess an intrinsic logic, and then explicitly to state the insight that that logical relationship implies.Looking critically at groupings of ideas requires hard work - indeed it is the essence of the thinking process - which is no doubt why it is so often ignored. But ignoring it means that you never quite say what you meant to your reader and - worse - you never quite grasp the essence of your thinking. That in turn not only wastes time and resources but, sadly, could mean you don't achieve all the major insights and breakthroughs in thinking that are possible." @meta-refid 1222-7373-4843-9877

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Communication - Consider the insight from Barbara Minto that can be applicable to the section where Marcio talks about communication being used to achieve clarity. The following quote should be considered on page 89 of the Minto pyramid principle under the chapter entitled imposing logical order. Consider the following quote, from p. 89: "The point I wish to reiterate is that you cannot tell that nonsense is being written on that unless you first impose a structure on it. It is the imposition of the structure that permits you to see the flaws and omissions." Further, in "summarizing grouped ideas," Barbara continues to trust the point that throught the development of the pyramid you are essentially discovering, iterating. Consider the following quote from p. 94: "In other words, the act of summarizing the groupings is the act of *completing the thinking*." @meta-refid 1222-3434-8383-8383

In the Course from Measure What Matters, 3 kinds of OKRs are presented to show that flexibility is important, and that there can be strategies that gives the team the opportunity to see what is happening in perspective. * These three kind of OKRs are: committed, aspirational and learning and the structure shoes order and logic ,from being specific, to allowing flexibility or to stretch, to allow the doer to be in learning mode. * [The reference to this is under the Coursera Course from Measure What Matters, reading entitled "The 3 kinds of OKR". ]  * Scqa note - complication and answer - If success defined in a flexible way is not set upfront, it will be then defined as progress happens which will cause frustration, will be unfair, and "create turmoil." This flexibility is what makes possible for the team to actually be able to set success upfront and not after the fact or during the progress. [Ref from the course is "Define Success Upfront"] According to this reading, the attitudes of the team will be different. It says that "Designating OKRs as committed or aspirational will help direct a team's actions.

They win everything! Right? They negotiate more effectively at work. People are more likely to listen to and abide by the plans that they formulate. They formulate better plans. They can negotiate better with their spouse and their children, because they're articulate. And it's such a funny thing, because it's so seldomly the case. You know. What's the utility of a liberal arts degree? Well, right now, damn little, I would say. But previously the whole idea was, well, it would teach you to communicate. It would teach you to write. Why is that useful? Well, because if you could communicate effectively, then you always do better at everything. You know. And it doesn't matter what endeavor you're pursuing. If you're a housing contractor and you have to negotiate with your clients, if you can formulate your plans and your arguments in an articulate way, you're way ahead of the game.

Eric was quite happy with the results and had in mind that the meeting would be about the decision to propose a new plan to the direction. To his surprise, mostly everyone denied moving forward. What he had discovered was that the change proposed, fundamented by the prior learning, would create additional costs for the company. Then Eric dug more asking help to find out the costs and they figured that it would be worth it to move forward. But still, another person brought up yet another good reason to not move forward, which was human resources: The fact that if an employee happen to rework in something, that would count against his career evaluation.

* p2 ( ), #outcome #output #okr, Andy Grove in p.17 of High Output Management uses output in the sense of outcome in his example: "Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity)." Of course, his use of output seems in the way of a further more strategic output which could be understood as outcome, in the sense of objectives. But nevertheless, the right breakdown, in Marcio's opinion is about not hiding the activity and the output in the face of an outstanding objective or outcome, thus enabling the window of opportunity to learn. 

* p2, ( ) Check the footnote, Adam Grant and the map of giver and taker, which is the book, and which was the talk - [^editornote_adamgrant_give_or_take] within 410_automatic_reaction_breaking..

* p1, ( ) Check Fred Kofman into "Searching impact" under Transcending with compassion 

* p1, ( ) reorder - It seems that "time for unreadiness" has to do with Julia Cameron's Containment concept, where protection has to exist, and the nurturing of the critic for growth to emerge, the one that is compassionate for the under development collaborator. Pick quotes from The Right to Write .168-170. This is under a subsection within 410_automatic_reaction_breaking... ref 43849384-43984983-4938948-5935935

* p1, ( ) insight - check containment protection notion (feat. Julia Cameron, p178-180) with 210_automatic_reaction_breaking and "lean narratives" or #okr #shock-absorbers - check if group thinking carrying values, such as values tied to outcomes, can supress the opportunity when growth of an individual would be possible, ideas for example, by using "he is best at" could lead to reaarangement into mediocre too - this Julia indicates writers in potential becoming journalists - as seen we supress the inner self that could save the situation. Thus, the topic of protection before critics. Might tie with case of "containment" by Julia Cameron, p168-170, check her amazing quotes on picking the friendly critis or friendly editor vs. protecting. Marcio had designed a notion of a black box producer in the face of a critic, when "under development" or vulnerable work, if seem from as a box, might be killed as exposed. But a strategic growth developer-coach, might see into the box, and unbundle, allowing growth, like p178-180 Julia Cameron indicates. Thus the management consideration could have to do with bundle to criticize and unbundle to allow development and growth. 9438988-4304093490-04304903-4928408 (lean, breaking auto reaction)

I mean it is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky and be flooded with a cocky feeling and then feel like pretty cool...or I can make all kind of phony things, you see what I mean, blinded by it or I can show you some really fancy movement. But to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself...now that, my friend, is very hard to do.”" and the question that was given to him in the first place at https://youtu.be/fEDfznOP820?si=EPhz-bNuv1971ugB&t=750

However, moments of uncertainty do not arrive with a banner — moment of uncertainty, new winds ahead. We end up falling into traps in the sequence of execution." 

* ( ) In the intro of foreword, there is "on one hand" and "on the other hand" and also a third element. I figure that it would ironic and interesting to continue the third aspect with "on yet another hand".

* ( ) Content structure review - Inercia movement - Marcio had removed 030_razoes_para_correr.txt from the part 2  but the article touches the subject of induction as a movment that does not want to stop. We need to check and celebrate if this idea has a place. In addition there is a reference to a note from Ogilvy. 

* ( ) Review Andy Grove's maturity within 470_culture_productivity which is poited by Michael Dearing's course GM2 / f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479 Marcio believes that maturity as indicated by Andy Grove in High Output Management has a connection with the model from effort to high-order objectives that might also transcend objectives. 

* ( ) Review the citation (2018, p.43) in 600_driven_by_fear.txt because the page reference is from the pt-br book while the actual reference is for the English book which I didn't buy. 

* ( ) Consider the quote from Michael "If Josephy Schumpeter were alive, he might point to all this and call it "creative destruction at the level of the individual rather than the economy." which is not public but could be really, likely, a good descriptor for the road that Marcio has taken. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/michael+harriet/KtbxLxgGBWTcQLPZfPBsFjsMVMTPkfMkDB

* ( ) As I have added the points of Michael, to section "How we experience" and also the section "The ethical performer" wihch connects with an e-mail message that Marcio has written to Michael Dearing; I have brought what seems to be a duplication of reference about Michael, perhaps. The part is duplicated, the quote "First you have to have an insight,.." which appears on "610_driven_by_love.txt" a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-a1b2-1234567890ab . I think that the quote can be likely removed from driven by love. 

* ( ) Check quote and note at [^editornote_reid_stages], the quote from Reid, perhaps from the above interview video if not from the Blitzscaling one. 

* ( ) Check Impact - there the situation of "flowing at the expense of denial of the important" fits, perhaps Impact? // * ( ) Anedoctal of Marcio - when Marcio had insight and told Michael that the major problem was of a party, for what was nice, like flow. And not the denial to do the boring. So the doing the so good things led to use of energy in excess.  Insigh of Marcio - Thank you Michael. Your reply resonated so much with things in my head, concerns, sometimes not clear; it adds so much clarity. A few months ago, I had, virtually speaking, screamed — ah! It's that freaking party the problem. The party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course). The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow. Insight of Michael, not a public quote, "Categorization --> clusters --> patterns --> priorities -- that's it exactly. Natural multi-taskers with a strong work ethic (that's what I hear in your opening above) can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them. That's a problem if you compound the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time. Thank you for the note. It's very helpful to see through your goggles." 

* ( ) Carving the stone - In the article about "Driven by Love", the point Marcio wants to bring the fact that the entrepreneur works in a discovery task as much in a execution task; and as they find value they carve themselves too, their identity melts. The influence to bring up the analogy of the artist was inspired in what Armando (Marcio's friend) said about arts in stones in Italy; and then Marcio seems to remember that Steve Blank used a similar metaphor. 

* ( ) Consider to talk about maturity model of Andy Grove, eighter in "driven by love" or "culture productivity". 

* ( ) Consider in "driven by love"  Feat. Reid hoffman, Reid Hoffman, em Comece por Você, indica em p.61 em "Mantenha uma identidade independente de empregadores específicos" cobre a situação onde pessoas, diante de projetos que acabam, ficam sem norte.

* ( ) @430_self_staging.txt Consider to match what Paul Graham has provoked, the growth situation, with the projection for growth situation, leading to complications such as the through of sorrow, and the note from Michael that "freaking PR" is not good. There is a reference about this in the editornote of the introduction = [^editornote_paulgraham_growth]: Paul Graham covers both the aspect that startups are for a growth situation but also covers that founders follow instincs such as a willingness to play the game. The through of sorrow of Paul Graham also depicts that startups force their status as political, projections, leading to falling in their own traps, such as to be sad that their projections were not real.

The real point is, as if there's no time, or as if time is not important, because of course, we know that time is important, therefore, consequently, conversely, if you think that time is important, you're actually gonna pressure yourself and do the wrong thing, so, here it is as if time is not important, therefore, Against the Accelerators is the movement of harmony, asking for reflection for founders, not that the actual knowledge that there is a lot of materials out there, that these materials out there are good, but you need to be reflective in order to decide, in order to pick the right materials, in order to have the amount of dedication for every single topic that deserves dedication, to have, to follow your intuition and reflective time for deciding the things you need to ignore, and the things you don't need to ignore, so that's my hope here, is to create a sort of a moment, as if we're all walking together, like a 10 mile hike, sort of trying to create a new spirit for your entrepreneurial endeavor." / The text is essentially stating that "Against the Accelerators" is not meant to be a critique of the accelerated world or the accelerator system, but rather a call for reflection and thoughtful decision-making. The book emphasizes the importance of being reflective and selective when encountering the abundance of materials available to entrepreneurs. It encourages founders to follow their intuition and dedicate time to the topics that truly deserve attention, in order to create a new spirit for their entrepreneurial journey. / - "Against the Accelerators" is not a critique of the accelerated world or accelerator system - Calls for reflection and thoughtful decision-making - Emphasizes the importance of being reflective and selective - Encourages founders to follow their intuition - Dedicate time to topics that truly deserve attention - Aims to create a new spirit for entrepreneurial journey

* ( ) Consider - 300/ strategic dissonance - The approach given by Fred Kofman, in Conscious Business, would be applicable to bring up the fact that the "organization" creates a social contract, an entity contract, and then the identity of that creates a value system which affects the employees identities.

# Part 0 

* Foreword - For entrepreneurs, interested in being around, for their lasting business or as professionals. Calls for slow down as organization to a complex process; that needs reflective character that respects the self. Motivation is the recognition that after industrial revolution, we can see the creative destruction as what changes econmic order and defines new, frees something indeed but also create new challenges for what is next. One challenge is a need to think outside platforms in general and outside entrepreneurial platforms that are likely urgent and mechanized. Why entrepreneurs and why it's important to think outside the urgency, mechanized, transactional box. 

* Introduction - Corporate world is a train for an ongoing conversation and being aware about what breaking conversation is worth it. SItuation is that if try to stop the train, is bad or slow, as opposed to urgent and fast. Complication is that urgent models defines our behaviors. Let's introduce abundance of current platform - with data, and tools and systems - supports mechanized cognition. With limited attention span as culturally accepted. With growth systems which enlarges risks. Reasons for moving forward is awareness, conscious entrepreneurship. Part 1,2,3.

* @todo - p1 (Done, reviewed with the idea of this beinng hard in the face of action energy) - In Introduction - Leading paragraph - On "getting things done" and "initial energy" against "slowness". On the first, leading paragraph, of the Introduction, I have started with "getting things done", and then saying and acknowledging that as a pretty strong statement. The prior elaboration had to do with an idea of some "faster" ways of doing it, as in gambling or to capture prizes. These can be valid but it may call the attention of the reader too far. In this review I consider that to be slow can be too daring in the face of the actual energetic movement; in other words because the team starts in energetic ways, with motivation, and inspiration, or vision, or passion, or you name it; And then they face a world that embraces them to work and supports it, a world given by a rich ecosystem that is also vibrant and which comes with call to actions, oriented to action first, and furthermore it is networked.

She had pointed in p.43 that we do not account the cost of failures to the being, the Unconscious. And within our growth situation of founders doing a startup, it may be so that the leaning towards some of the methods, a in lean methods (which makes sense if an entity does not hurt itself,) may actually account to the well-beings of the beings, the individuals, given that they are too active to impact the future. @meta-refid 1222-3332-3334-4444

* @todo - p2 (Done, not understood ) - In Part 2 - In Searching Impact - there is a whole section entitled "The guardian" which seems as a good introduction to the chapter "The feedback of urgency". Ref 9884-8944-9492-9044 #duplicated #crossreference 

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Impact - #self-actualization #growth #transcending #impact - On Redefition of Self-Actualization from Maslow - Consider the quote "This makes it possible for us to redefine self-actualization in such a way as to purge it of its static and typological shortcomings, and to make it less a kind of all-or-none pantheon into which some rare people enter at the age of 60. We may define it as an episode, or a spurt in which the powers of the person come together in a particularly eficient and intensely enjoyable way, and in which he is more integrated and less split, more open for experience, more idiosyncratic, more perfectly expressive or spontaneous, or fully funcioning, more creative, more humorous, more ego-transcending, more independent of this lower needs, etc. He becomes in these episodes more truly himself, more perfectly actualizing his potentialitiws, closer to the core of his Being. " (Abraham, Maslow., 2011, p.91) / @meta-refid 1222-2333-4333-5666

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Running / Fears / 3rd section #grove #intel #fears #growth - Supporting footnote for the exercise of Grove and Moore - The one in the conditions, able to grow or defend, may engage in projecting gains for the growth option. Consider the quote from page 56 from chapter Defense and Growth from the book Toward the Psychology of Been, by Abraham Maslow: "12. In this process the environment (parents, therapists, teachers) is important in various ways, even though the ultimate choice must be made by the child: a) it can gratify his basic needs for safety, belongingness, love and respect, so that he can feel unthreatened, autonomous, interested and spontaneous and thus dare to choose the unknown. b) it can help by making the growth choice positively attractive and less dangerous, and by making the regressive choice less attractive and more costly." Note: I think this in a way aligns with the mental exercise that Grove has given, when he considered them to be out, fired, and what the other CEO would do. @meta-refid 1212-3232-7676-7474

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Space - Check on the metaphorical of "I think therefore I am... " @meta-refid 1222-2323-3342-4466 - Ref - In other words, anything that is built, that exists in the environment, and that is actively being used is what explains the "I think therefore I am .." exaclty because it requires them to be ".. using a tool," in the first place. 

* @todo - p2 (Done, taken out) - In Environment, Spaces, Bundled forcers - Consider the insight from Maury Klein for the unleash of innovation that had happened when the Bolton and Watt patents expired. Check the quote from 53-54 of The Power Makers: "versions of a railroad had been around since at least the 17th century to ease the hauling of coal and ore from mines. Railroads paved with stone were built. Around 1630, an Englishman named Belmont got the bright idea of replacing the stone with heavy planks. This gradually evolved into rails made first of wood and then of iron. By the late 18th century, the wheels running over these rails had flanges to improve their grip. The road of rails had become familiar at least to miners by the early 19th century, but it lacked a source of power beyond the horse. The steam engine was an obvious possibility. Work on it expanded rapidly after the 1800s when the Bolton and Watt patents expired. Across England, the continent, and the United States, men with a mechanical bent tinkered doggedly with versions of the steam engine, each one in search of a unique solution to whatever problem or challenge intrigued him. Some worked in the privacy of their own homes, others went into the business of building engines. Many of the men who had worked for Bolton and Watt took their expertise elsewhere or went into business for themselves. They soon realized, as did most of other builders, that the Watt low-pressure engine would not do for a land carriage because it simply could not generate enough power. Yet, strong fears remained about the dangers of high-pressure engines. As late as the 1820s, in England, the stationary steam engine was still considered a serious, even preferred alternative to the high-pressure engine for railroad motive power."

* @todo - p1 (Done) - In Environment - Following, The situation of Brian and the writer that may appear to be valid, as a research or a check for the competition may well show the very point where the weak is validated as strong; thus how the fact that the competition appears through a given channel makes the competition even stronger. @ref-id 1122-3323-4432-2233

* @todo - p1 (Done) - In Environment - @above, Just like Identity we have seen how we operate by developing ourselves identitying ourselves with others, or groups; this chapter is an exploration of how we identify, choose with, choose by, methods, platforms, tools, and data from the environment of a specific domain. @meta-refid 1122-3323-3324-5544

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment Space - Consider to bring ideas from Joseph Schumpeter as Marcio is talking about the situation of abundance of solutions in a space - which it might have to do with the unrealistic exploration by Schumpeter that the entrepreneurial function is not needed if all needs are satisfied - but know too that where Marcio is going is that needs are too created, so spaces can be a trap plus the hint of leisure from Schumpeter might be a case to consider too. Nevertheless the saturated situation of Schumpeter can be realized. @meta-refid 1212-2233-3433-3933

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment - Add a footnote about Schumpeter and the notion that the entrepreneur is essentially one that executes an entrepreneurial function of getting things done. @meta-refid 1212-2233-4433-9494

* @todo - p1 (Done) - In Identity - Maslow and identity developed by work -  It might be worth it to point that Maslow indicator for the development of an identity in the work place could be challenged with the simple idea that people live a life beyond work. I think that Maslow's point has to be seen under the context in time that people used to be a lot in the same work space and under the isolated observation that there are situations which is likely to be the case, due to the points given such as when the work or team embraces the person. @meta-refid 1233-1234-4567-0987

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Not so Radical Focus - Peter Drucker wrote something about tops-down in the Managing Oneself where he brings back the historical context. A supporting point, so that the reader reflects on the full denial of the tops-down under the impression that free is good may align with what Peter Drucker may have said in the "managing oneself" and also  I recall that Jonathan or Melissa said it too in some article in the HFIYM book.

* p2 (Done, @Marcio), In Lean Attention Deficit, 630_lean_no_lean - Consider to quote Julia as she explains how a write internalizes the "editor" - what he would say.
