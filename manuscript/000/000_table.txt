We may consider for this leading paragraph to exercise a pitch using a SCqA so that you lead the audience to understand that the potential for the exploration of a space where one happens to be bundling or unbundling, they happen to do that to optimize the actual job-to-be-done but at the same time to pick a battle of a job given an anchoring of a zoom level.

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Environment, Spaces, Bundled forcers - Consider the insight from Maury Klein for the unleash of innovation that had happened when the Bolton and Watt patents expired. Check the quote from 53-54 of The Power Makers: "versions of a railroad had been around since at least the 17th century to ease the hauling of coal and ore from mines. Railroads paved with stone were built. Around 1630, an Englishman named Belmont got the bright idea of replacing the stone with heavy planks. This gradually evolved into rails made first of wood and then of iron. By the late 18th century, the wheels running over these rails had flanges to improve their grip. The road of rails had become familiar at least to miners by the early 19th century, but it lacked a source of power beyond the horse. The steam engine was an obvious possibility. Work on it expanded rapidly after the 1800s when the Bolton and Watt patents expired. Across England, the continent, and the United States, men with a mechanical bent tinkered doggedly with versions of the steam engine, each one in search of a unique solution to whatever problem or challenge intrigued him. Some worked in the privacy of their own homes, others went into the business of building engines. Many of the men who had worked for Bolton and Watt took their expertise elsewhere or went into business for themselves. They soon realized, as did most of other builders, that the Watt low-pressure engine would not do for a land carriage because it simply could not generate enough power. Yet, strong fears remained about the dangers of high-pressure engines. As late as the 1820s, in England, the stationary steam engine was still considered a serious, even preferred alternative to the high-pressure engine for railroad motive power."

* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Introduction - As in guide for the book - Check page 16 of the introduction of the book entitled Flow by Mihaly, how he had geniously presented a sort of strategy of the book which may be a perspective or a mindset that he wonders from the reader. This seems to be a way to filter out things and to invite the reader. @meta-refid 7383-6383-7383-7383

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Communication - Consider a quote from Barbara Minto, from page 73, Introduction to Part 2, Logical Thinking: "The tendency to list appears to be universal, and as a technique for getting a rough approximation of your thinking out where it can be looked at critically, it is fine. The trick is not to stop there, but to go further to make sure that the ideas in each grouping actually possess an intrinsic logic, and then explicitly to state the insight that that logical relationship implies.Looking critically at groupings of ideas requires hard work - indeed it is the essence of the thinking process - which is no doubt why it is so often ignored. But ignoring it means that you never quite say what you meant to your reader and - worse - you never quite grasp the essence of your thinking. That in turn not only wastes time and resources but, sadly, could mean you don't achieve all the major insights and breakthroughs in thinking that are possible." @meta-refid 1222-7373-4843-9877

* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Communication - Consider the insight from Barbara Minto that can be applicable to the section where Marcio talks about communication being used to achieve clarity. The following quote should be considered on page 89 of the Minto pyramid principle under the chapter entitled imposing logical order. Consider the following quote, from p. 89: "The point I wish to reiterate is that you cannot tell that nonsense is being written on that unless you first impose a structure on it. It is the imposition of the structure that permits you to see the flaws and omissions." Further, in "summarizing grouped ideas," Barbara continues to trust the point that throught the development of the pyramid you are essentially discovering, iterating. Consider the following quote from p. 94: "In other words, the act of summarizing the groupings is the act of *completing the thinking*." @meta-refid 1222-3434-8383-8383

Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation. We are indeed influenced to an amazing extent by people with whom we identify."

In the Course from Measure What Matters, 3 kinds of OKRs are presented to show that flexibility is important, and that there can be strategies that gives the team the opportunity to see what is happening in perspective. * These three kind of OKRs are: committed, aspirational and learning and the structure shoes order and logic ,from being specific, to allowing flexibility or to stretch, to allow the doer to be in learning mode. * [The reference to this is under the Coursera Course from Measure What Matters, reading entitled "The 3 kinds of OKR". ]  * Scqa note - complication and answer - If success defined in a flexible way is not set upfront, it will be then defined as progress happens which will cause frustration, will be unfair, and "create turmoil." This flexibility is what makes possible for the team to actually be able to set success upfront and not after the fact or during the progress. [Ref from the course is "Define Success Upfront"] According to this reading, the attitudes of the team will be different.

* p2 ( ) - In Part 2, Communications, 040_communications.txt - Jordan Peterson may have a good point about the interaticve nature of editing, with technological tools like word processors, and which also gives a hint that one could enter into being arbitrarily editing if one didn't have a process https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3otsJZWKbk&t=915s This can support the idea of the macro version of this where workers are doing arbitrary movements and trying to edit in retrospect; which eventually works, perhaps, although have a cost to pay; such as the cost that people could never really think through the process themselves, just plug the good reasons and eventually the machine puts together the "chapters".

* p2 ( ) - In part 2, Communications, 040_communications.txt - Consider Jordan Peterson's insight about writing and arguments: "As you progress through life, one of the things you realize, especially if you're dealing with people in relatively sophisticated situations -- but it doesn't really matter -- is that those who formulate the best arguments win. They win everything! Right? They negotiate more effectively at work. People are more likely to listen to and abide by the plans that they formulate. They formulate better plans. They can negotiate better with their spouse and their children, because they're articulate. And it's such a funny thing, because it's so seldomly the case. You know. What's the utility of a liberal arts degree? Well, right now, damn little, I would say. But previously the whole idea was, well, it would teach you to communicate. It would teach you to write. Why is that useful? Well, because if you could communicate effectively, then you always do better at everything. You know. And it doesn't matter what endeavor you're pursuing. If you're a housing contractor and you have to negotiate with your clients, if you can formulate your plans and your arguments in an articulate way, you're way ahead of the game.

Eric was quite happy with the results and had in mind that the meeting would be about the decision to propose a new plan to the direction. To his surprise, mostly everyone denied moving forward. What he had discovered was that the change proposed, fundamented by the prior learning, would create additional costs for the company. Then Eric dug more asking help to find out the costs and they figured that it would be worth it to move forward. But still, another person brought up yet another good reason to not move forward, which was human resources: The fact that if an employee happen to rework in something, that would count against his career evaluation.

* p2 ( ), #outcome #output #okr, Andy Grove in p.17 of High Output Management uses output in the sense of outcome in his example: "Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity)." Of course, his use of output seems in the way of a further more strategic output which could be understood as outcome, in the sense of objectives. But nevertheless, the right breakdown, in Marcio's opinion is about not hiding the activity and the output in the face of an outstanding objective or outcome, thus enabling the window of opportunity to learn.

* p1, ( ) Check Fred Kofman into "Searching impact" under Transcending with compassion 

* p1, ( ) reorder - It seems that "time for unreadiness" has to do with Julia Cameron's Containment concept, where protection has to exist, and the nurturing of the critic for growth to emerge, the one that is compassionate for the under development collaborator.

Julia Cameron, p178-180) with 210_automatic_reaction_breaking and "lean narratives" or #okr #shock-absorbers - check if group thinking carrying values, such as values tied to outcomes, can supress the opportunity when growth of an individual would be possible, ideas for example, by using "he is best at" could lead to reaarangement into mediocre too - this Julia indicates writers in potential becoming journalists - as seen we supress the inner self that could save the situation. Thus, the topic of protection before critics. Might tie with case of "containment" by Julia Cameron, p168-170, check her amazing quotes on picking the friendly critis or friendly editor vs. protecting. Marcio had designed a notion of a black box producer in the face of a critic, when "under development" or vulnerable work, if seem from as a box, might be killed as exposed. But a strategic growth developer-coach, might see into the box, and unbundle, allowing growth, like p178-180 Julia Cameron indicates. Thus the management consideration could have to do with bundle to criticize and unbundle to allow development and growth. 9438988-4304093490-04304903-4928408 (lean, breaking auto reaction)

But to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself...now that, my friend, is very hard to do.”" and the question that was given to him in the first place at https://youtu.be/fEDfznOP820?si=EPhz-bNuv1971ugB&t=750

* ( ) Review the citation (2018, p.43) in 600_driven_by_fear.txt because the page reference is from the pt-br book while the actual reference is for the English book which I didn't buy. 

* ( ) Consider the quote from Michael "If Josephy Schumpeter were alive, he might point to all this and call it "creative destruction at the level of the individual rather than the economy." which is not public but could be really, likely, a good descriptor for the road that Marcio has taken. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/michael+harriet/KtbxLxgGBWTcQLPZfPBsFjsMVMTPkfMkDB

* ( ) As I have added the points of Michael, to section "How we experience" and also the section "The ethical performer" wihch connects with an e-mail message that Marcio has written to Michael Dearing; I have brought what seems to be a duplication of reference about Michael, perhaps. The part is duplicated, the quote "First you have to have an insight,.." which appears on "610_driven_by_love.txt" a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-a1b2-1234567890ab . I think that the quote can be likely removed from driven by love. 

* ( ) Check quote and note at [^editornote_reid_stages], the quote from Reid, perhaps from the above interview video if not from the Blitzscaling one. 

* ( ) Check Impact - there the situation of "flowing at the expense of denial of the important" fits, perhaps Impact? // * ( ) Anedoctal of Marcio - when Marcio had insight and told Michael that the major problem was of a party, for what was nice, like flow. And not the denial to do the boring. So the doing the so good things led to use of energy in excess.  Insigh of Marcio - Thank you Michael. Your reply resonated so much with things in my head, concerns, sometimes not clear; it adds so much clarity. A few months ago, I had, virtually speaking, screamed — ah! It's that freaking party the problem. The party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course). The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow. Insight of Michael, not a public quote, "Categorization --> clusters --> patterns --> priorities -- that's it exactly. Natural multi-taskers with a strong work ethic (that's what I hear in your opening above) can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them. That's a problem if you compound the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time. Thank you for the note. It's very helpful to see through your goggles." 

* ( ) Carving the stone - In the article about "Driven by Love", the point Marcio wants to bring the fact that the entrepreneur works in a discovery task as much in a execution task; and as they find value they carve themselves too, their identity melts. The influence to bring up the analogy of the artist was inspired in what Armando (Marcio's friend) said about arts in stones in Italy; and then Marcio seems to remember that Steve Blank used a similar metaphor. 

* ( ) Consider to talk about maturity model of Andy Grove, eighter in "driven by love" or "culture productivity". 

* ( ) Consider in "driven by love"  Feat. Reid hoffman, Reid Hoffman, em Comece por Você, indica em p.61 em "Mantenha uma identidade independente de empregadores específicos" cobre a situação onde pessoas, diante de projetos que acabam, ficam sem norte.

* ( ) @430_self_staging.txt Consider to match what Paul Graham has provoked, the growth situation, with the projection for growth situation, leading to complications such as the through of sorrow, and the note from Michael that "freaking PR" is not good. There is a reference about this in the editornote of the introduction = [^editornote_paulgraham_growth]: Paul Graham covers both the aspect that startups are for a growth situation but also covers that founders follow instincs such as a willingness to play the game. The through of sorrow of Paul Graham also depicts that startups force their status as political, projections, leading to falling in their own traps, such as to be sad that their projections were not real.

The real point is, as if there's no time, or as if time is not important, because of course, we know that time is important, therefore, consequently, conversely, if you think that time is important, you're actually gonna pressure yourself and do the wrong thing, so, here it is as if time is not important, therefore, Against the Accelerators is the movement of harmony, asking for reflection for founders, not that the actual knowledge that there is a lot of materials out there, that these materials out there are good, but you need to be reflective in order to decide, in order to pick the right materials, in order to have the amount of dedication for every single topic that deserves dedication, to have, to follow your intuition and reflective time for deciding the things you need to ignore, and the things you don't need to ignore, so that's my hope here, is to create a sort of a moment, as if we're all walking together, like a 10 mile hike, sort of trying to create a new spirit for your entrepreneurial endeavor." / The text is essentially stating that "Against the Accelerators" is not meant to be a critique of the accelerated world or the accelerator system, but rather a call for reflection and thoughtful decision-making. The book emphasizes the importance of being reflective and selective when encountering the abundance of materials available to entrepreneurs. It encourages founders to follow their intuition and dedicate time to the topics that truly deserve attention, in order to create a new spirit for their entrepreneurial journey. / - "Against the Accelerators" is not a critique of the accelerated world or accelerator system - Calls for reflection and thoughtful decision-making - Emphasizes the importance of being reflective and selective - Encourages founders to follow their intuition - Dedicate time to topics that truly deserve attention - Aims to create a new spirit for entrepreneurial journey

* ( ) Consider - 300/ strategic dissonance - The approach given by Fred Kofman, in Conscious Business, would be applicable to bring up the fact that the "organization" creates a social contract, an entity contract, and then the identity of that creates a value system which affects the employees identities.

# Part 0 

* Foreword - For entrepreneurs, interested in being around, for their lasting business or as professionals. Calls for slow down as organization to a complex process; that needs reflective character that respects the self. Motivation is the recognition that after industrial revolution, we can see the creative destruction as what changes econmic order and defines new, frees something indeed but also create new challenges for what is next. One challenge is a need to think outside platforms in general and outside entrepreneurial platforms that are likely urgent and mechanized. Why entrepreneurs and why it's important to think outside the urgency, mechanized, transactional box. 

* Introduction - Corporate world is a train for an ongoing conversation and being aware about what breaking conversation is worth it. SItuation is that if try to stop the train, is bad or slow, as opposed to urgent and fast. Complication is that urgent models defines our behaviors. Let's introduce abundance of current platform - with data, and tools and systems - supports mechanized cognition. With limited attention span as culturally accepted. With growth systems which enlarges risks. Reasons for moving forward is awareness, conscious entrepreneurship. Part 1,2,3.

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Environment Space - Consider to bring ideas from Joseph Schumpeter as Marcio is talking about the situation of abundance of solutions in a space - which it might have to do with the unrealistic exploration by Schumpeter that the entrepreneurial function is not needed if all needs are satisfied - but know too that where Marcio is going is that needs are too created, so spaces can be a trap plus the hint of leisure from Schumpeter might be a case to consider too. Nevertheless the saturated situation of Schumpeter can be realized. @meta-refid 1212-2233-3433-3933

* @todo - p1 (Done) - In Identity - Maslow and identity developed by work -  It might be worth it to point that Maslow indicator for the development of an identity in the work place could be challenged with the simple idea that people live a life beyond work. I think that Maslow's point has to be seen under the context in time that people used to be a lot in the same work space and under the isolated observation that there are situations which is likely to be the case, due to the points given such as when the work or team embraces the person. @meta-refid 1233-1234-4567-0987

* @todo - p2 (Done) - In Not so Radical Focus - Peter Drucker wrote something about tops-down in the Managing Oneself where he brings back the historical context. A supporting point, so that the reader reflects on the full denial of the tops-down under the impression that free is good may align with what Peter Drucker may have said in the "managing oneself" and also  I recall that Jonathan or Melissa said it too in some article in the HFIYM book.
