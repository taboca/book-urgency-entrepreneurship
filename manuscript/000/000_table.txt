* ( ) Check Impact - there the situation of "flowing at the expense of denial of the important" fits, perhaps Impact? // * ( ) Anedoctal of Marcio - when Marcio had insight and told Michael that the major problem was of a party, for what was nice, like flow. And not the denial to do the boring. So the doing the so good things led to use of energy in excess.  Insigh of Marcio - Thank you Michael. Your reply resonated so much with things in my head, concerns, sometimes not clear; it adds so much clarity. A few months ago, I had, virtually speaking, screamed — ah! It's that freaking party the problem. The party would be, for example, a 4h engineering activity that goes over the time of other important things (not seen as critical of course). The benefit was so great that a sort of specialized mindset acts. I was not conscious and would never judge that as a potential evil act. Well, how could it be? The very greatness, supposedly my creative engine, the productive engine. And worse, the general brain command was — continue! Do it, Marcio, advance that. You can fix other things later. I was assuming that a great actor would compensate for the other stuff running slow. Insight of Michael, not a public quote, "Categorization --> clusters --> patterns --> priorities -- that's it exactly. Natural multi-taskers with a strong work ethic (that's what I hear in your opening above) can easily lose site of what matters most because getting things done feels terrific and is comparatively easy / cheap for them. That's a problem if you compound the implicit deprioritization of the few most important things, in favor of many things because we love to get lots of things done, over a long period of time. Thank you for the note. It's very helpful to see through your goggles." 

* ( ) Carving the stone - In the article about "Driven by Love", the point Marcio wants to bring the fact that the entrepreneur works in a discovery task as much in a execution task; and as they find value they carve themselves too, their identity melts. The influence to bring up the analogy of the artist was inspired in what Armando (Marcio's friend) said about arts in stones in Italy; and then Marcio seems to remember that Steve Blank used a similar metaphor. 

* ( ) Consider to talk about maturity model of Andy Grove, eighter in "driven by love" or "culture productivity". 

* ( ) Consider in "driven by love"  Feat. Reid hoffman, Reid Hoffman, em Comece por Você, indica em p.61 em "Mantenha uma identidade independente de empregadores específicos" cobre a situação onde pessoas, diante de projetos que acabam, ficam sem norte.  

* ( ) Consider the note of Steve Blank about bundle/unbundle and "their were masters of their own fate"  https://youtu.be/UFx2CQUTpYo?si=qM8ABQJpKuhmHs8c&t=2349 which can be applicable to the situation of "Space" and fairchild Semiconductor, and more. 

* ( ) @430_self_staging.txt Consider to match what Paul Graham has provoked, the growth situation, with the projection for growth situation, leading to complications such as the through of sorrow, and the note from Michael that "freaking PR" is not good. There is a reference about this in the editornote of the introduction = [^editornote_paulgraham_growth]: Paul Graham covers both the aspect that startups are for a growth situation but also covers that founders follow instincs such as a willingness to play the game. The through of sorrow of Paul Graham also depicts that startups force their status as political, projections, leading to falling in their own traps, such as to be sad that their projections were not real.

* ( ) Consider - against the accelerators - "In regards to Against the Accelerators, that's the title for my paragraph, I guess, or section in the chapter, therefore, Against the Accelerators is not really a proposition to a negative thinking, that an attack to the accelerated world or the accelerator system, that it's pretty much embodied or affecting every single entrepreneur there, Against the Accelerators is actually a proposition for a reflection, therefore, it's not that what should be said is against, but the actual what should be said is in favor of the accelerators, therefore, this is a book in the field of acceleration, in a way, but needless to say, that it's about accelerating, that it's about getting there faster. The real point is, as if there's no time, or as if time is not important, because of course, we know that time is important, therefore, consequently, conversely, if you think that time is important, you're actually gonna pressure yourself and do the wrong thing, so, here it is as if time is not important, therefore, Against the Accelerators is the movement of harmony, asking for reflection for founders, not that the actual knowledge that there is a lot of materials out there, that these materials out there are good, but you need to be reflective in order to decide, in order to pick the right materials, in order to have the amount of dedication for every single topic that deserves dedication, to have, to follow your intuition and reflective time for deciding the things you need to ignore, and the things you don't need to ignore, so that's my hope here, is to create a sort of a moment, as if we're all walking together, like a 10 mile hike, sort of trying to create a new spirit for your entrepreneurial endeavor." / The text is essentially stating that "Against the Accelerators" is not meant to be a critique of the accelerated world or the accelerator system, but rather a call for reflection and thoughtful decision-making. The book emphasizes the importance of being reflective and selective when encountering the abundance of materials available to entrepreneurs. It encourages founders to follow their intuition and dedicate time to the topics that truly deserve attention, in order to create a new spirit for their entrepreneurial journey. / - "Against the Accelerators" is not a critique of the accelerated world or accelerator system - Calls for reflection and thoughtful decision-making - Emphasizes the importance of being reflective and selective - Encourages founders to follow their intuition - Dedicate time to topics that truly deserve attention - Aims to create a new spirit for entrepreneurial journey

* ( ) Consider - 300/ strategic dissonance - The approach given by Fred Kofman, in Conscious Business, would be applicable to bring up the fact that the "organization" creates a social contract, an entity contract, and then the identity of that creates a value system which affects the employees identities. 

* ( ) Consider - 000/foreword - Testimonial of Marcio that the book, due to its origins and the research work - a startup supposed to be called Fast Clip - would have an actual other title as "The B side of Blitzscaling"  

* ( ) Consider - 000/foreword or 000/introduction Chris Yeh quote, about the "inner workings" or "pre workings" of Blitzscaling, some of the conditions, such as when the founders have "To Things That Don't Scale". https://youtu.be/IyY3t4loUig?si=9PKW_yywrr5o3nhS&t=228 and then, the complication, what is the readiness level to be able to take yourself towards that sort of movement, that it takes to "be there" towards that readiness level.

* ( ) 720_do_things_that_dont_scale.txt "Do things that don't scale" -> Perhaps  this can fit within "maximizing value" which may actually connect with value and pricing, again, Michael. perhaps Marcio should be able to find a connection with "discovering value for defining pricing"

* Foreword - For entrepreneurs, interested in being around, for their lasting business or as professionals. Calls for slow down as organization to a complex process; that needs reflective character that respects the self. Motivation is the recognition that after industrial revolution, we can see the creative destruction as what changes econmic order and defines new, frees something indeed but also create new challenges for what is next. One challenge is a need to think outside platforms in general and outside entrepreneurial platforms that are likely urgent and mechanized. Why entrepreneurs and why it's important to think outside the urgency, mechanized, transactional box. 

* Introduction - Corporate world is a train for an ongoing conversation and being aware about what breaking conversation is worth it. SItuation is that if try to stop the train, is bad or slow, as opposed to urgent and fast. Complication is that urgent models defines our behaviors. Let's introduce abundance of current platform - with data, and tools and systems - supports mechanized cognition. With limited attention span as culturally accepted. With growth systems which enlarges risks. Reasons for moving forward is awareness, conscious entrepreneurship. Part 1,2,3.
