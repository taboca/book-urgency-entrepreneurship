* ( ) Consider - against the accelerators - "In regards to Against the Accelerators, that's the title for my paragraph, I guess, or section in the chapter, therefore, Against the Accelerators is not really a proposition to a negative thinking, that an attack to the accelerated world or the accelerator system, that it's pretty much embodied or affecting every single entrepreneur there, Against the Accelerators is actually a proposition for a reflection, therefore, it's not that what should be said is against, but the actual what should be said is in favor of the accelerators, therefore, this is a book in the field of acceleration, in a way, but needless to say, that it's about accelerating, that it's about getting there faster. The real point is, as if there's no time, or as if time is not important, because of course, we know that time is important, therefore, consequently, conversely, if you think that time is important, you're actually gonna pressure yourself and do the wrong thing, so, here it is as if time is not important, therefore, Against the Accelerators is the movement of harmony, asking for reflection for founders, not that the actual knowledge that there is a lot of materials out there, that these materials out there are good, but you need to be reflective in order to decide, in order to pick the right materials, in order to have the amount of dedication for every single topic that deserves dedication, to have, to follow your intuition and reflective time for deciding the things you need to ignore, and the things you don't need to ignore, so that's my hope here, is to create a sort of a moment, as if we're all walking together, like a 10 mile hike, sort of trying to create a new spirit for your entrepreneurial endeavor." / The text is essentially stating that "Against the Accelerators" is not meant to be a critique of the accelerated world or the accelerator system, but rather a call for reflection and thoughtful decision-making. The book emphasizes the importance of being reflective and selective when encountering the abundance of materials available to entrepreneurs. It encourages founders to follow their intuition and dedicate time to the topics that truly deserve attention, in order to create a new spirit for their entrepreneurial journey. / - "Against the Accelerators" is not a critique of the accelerated world or accelerator system - Calls for reflection and thoughtful decision-making - Emphasizes the importance of being reflective and selective - Encourages founders to follow their intuition - Dedicate time to topics that truly deserve attention - Aims to create a new spirit for entrepreneurial journey

* ( ) Consider - 300/ strategic dissonance - The approach given by Fred Kofman, in Conscious Business, would be applicable to bring up the fact that the "organization" creates a social contract, an entity contract, and then the identity of that creates a value system which affects the employees identities. 

* ( ) Consider - 000/foreword - Testimonial of Marcio that the book, due to its origins and the research work - a startup supposed to be called Fast Clip - would have an actual other title as "The B side of Blitzscaling"  

* ( ) Consider - 000/foreword or 000/introduction Chris Yeh quote, about the "inner workings" or "pre workings" of Blitzscaling, some of the conditions, such as when the founders have "To Things That Don't Scale". https://youtu.be/IyY3t4loUig?si=9PKW_yywrr5o3nhS&t=228 and then, the complication, what is the readiness level to be able to take yourself towards that sort of movement, that it takes to "be there" towards that readiness level.

* ( ) Check add Michael on Bad investors, proprietary in the boat 
* ( ) 720_do_things_that_dont_scale.txt "Do things that don't scale" -> Perhaps  this can fit within "maximizing value" which may actually connect with value and pricing, again, Michael. perhaps Marcio should be able to find a connection with "discovering value for defining pricing"
