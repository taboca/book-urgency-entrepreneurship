# Foreword #

The good news for entrepreneurs is that their ground allows them to accelerate. The world promises results, for entrepreneurial projects and their lives. In this connected and interactive setting, entrepreneurs are empowered to swiftly navigate towards their goals. This empowerment start with stories that are brithly coherent but further accelerate with them with a rich ecosystem where a lot of resources can be verified as proven such as popular startup methodologies. 

Consider, for example, the cost for acessing motivation from networks, for instance as we can network and be thrilled with stories that enlighten our entrepreneurial spirit. On the other hand, consider the tools, such as methodologies that are proven to advance collaboration. But more than motivation and processes, we are equally able to advance the actual startup using networks of support - the interactive systems where we can get in touch with potential customers, investors, mentors, practitioners, cofounders, partners, and more. 

In this world, there are far many solutions to help us now throughout all the process steps [^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap] of the entrepreneurial effort. In other words, the modern entrepreneur is better equipped - if not in a hypermarket of offerings - with solutions that helps them from definition to execution to conclusion. No way all that there is now can be thought, not generally under the circustances and the pace of execution, as a bad bad ground for founders. Even if when starthing things look like a desert and quite lonely, it is not so lonely on the other hand, as anyone will feel like less naked and quite equipped, like wearing an armor super equipped which make us to feel energetic and empowered. The inner human is there, confirmed by the beat of the heart and following what was dreamed upon, these modern extensions are optimistically augumenting the potential. A single command we give to ourselves - quite consciously - and we can get in the flow, quite quasi-unconsciously we fall into action with tools and methods of all sorts and get the feeling that we are traveling fast or performing like heroes. There are always online .com solutions from Monday to Monday and entry points supporting us to feel that we are ready to go in front of the challenges ahead which now may sound more like battles to be won. This ground, or the equilibrium in this ground, seems really around the fact that they not only feel empowered to jump to action but motivated that there is a world of resources that they can access, such as tools, such as assistance with others - weapons for the action, the fight. But what is the enemy ahead? It could be to change the market reality, to help a group of people with a need, to put a dent in the universe, implement the rocket, you name it. Undeniably, in essense, there is ahead indeed a world problem which we want to solve - a reality to change. As we enter that quest, they also know that they are in a quest as learners, equally undeniable. But we know too that there is a lot available to help us to do it better, to do it faster, to do it through collaboration; available through the frameworks of all kinds, through role models, through stories, through networks, through paltforms, through collaborators that can also be recruited. It is undeniable that they can access collaboration especially using the digital and networked matrix where everything happens. The equilibrium in this space, this terrain, starts with the fact that the fight, and movement, demands a vision, a quest, a goal, first, like what they have volunteered for. After that, they also recognize their ecosystem as the space allowing them to move fast such as fight specific battles; or scale themselves, so that they can get more equipment, more "weapons", more people, access other levels and grow themselves. This is the space where startups can grow, and they can warp, increase in size, grow from the founders in armors to family and tribes in a small ship to become leaders of a more complex ship and a quest with larger teams. 

[^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap]: In the article "Mapping the Job-to-be-Done" (Ulwick, 2017), Tony Ulwick defines job map as an "ideal process flow" that customers go through as they are involved in a job to be done. The steps are: Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude. The main point of the job map is to help the deconstruction of a job that customers are trying to get done, thus with the understanding of customer needs, before considering the opportunities in terms of products or solutions. With that said, I have drawn an analogy from this concept - due to its underlying universality - to provoke us to consider that if the very job of the entrepreneurial is yet another job to be done and conversely many solutions exists: methods, tools, platforms, and more.

But the cost for maintaining that equilibrium is not generally as topic especially when one is eager towards the battle, especially when an entrepreneur jumps into the superchanged armor. The problem is that this urgent, accelerated, and high-pressure mode, frames their present. Now, just like experts, entrepreneurs make accelerated decisions, even when they are starting - in the understanding phase when ideas are still forming - along with the discovery process, trying to find the value in their team, for their product, for serving needs of customers, seeking investors, etc. But how would this be a problem? It isn't, or at least it does not appear to be, as a lot of good solutions, or product-like solutions, are cheaply available in what appears to be a supermarket with all sorts of solutions which are all approved by the regulating community, the ecosystem, which appear as quality solutions. The problem is precisely that in the pressure to undertake arises the pressure for decision which stifles the consideration for management of entrepreneurship. This leads to entrepreneurs to fall in traps as they navigate the ecosystem of entrepreneurship and the fast-paced culture of entrepreneurship. Well, falling is not even perceived as trap but as part of the equation, to fail and learn, or to learn fast. So, right there, after a fail, there is no time to reflect, as in one that went to the supermarket in a hurry and hungry, picked a rotten meal, but in a hurry goes back to the same market searching for drugs for indigestion. 

For me, the confrontation with this fast-paced intent was a major reason to advance this book, which came out of my own struggle or the swim in the ocean of solutions. I had the opportunity to engage with reflective thinking and recognized the importance of bringing up strategic management to entrepreneurs, especially duringn the initial stages of an entrepreneurial effort. Strategy is usually a word reserved for, or related to, the strategy for pushing a solution to the market. If that is true, then the problem is exposed, right there, as the word fails to find its place in the managemerial context of entrepreneurship. The price to pay is generally not seen - as there are not many stories of the many that gave up - not if you search for solutions for great results. What is under, though, is everywhere, and it is being said, and it is sad and not exciting. That the price we pay when entrepreneurial management is not present, comes in terms of confusion, frustration, willpower loss, impacting the premature end of a journey, dying slow journey, following instincts, inability to learn, changing directions prematurely, failing to create products that people love, losing interest of good investors, arbitrary use of resources, disrespect for constituents, and more. 

Our overarching theme ahead does not escape the subject of productivity, for the entrepreneur's life and their act of entrepreneurship, which naturally in the case of startups involves risk management, which naturally finds a confrontation with the struggle for being performant. In this regard, Peter Drucker, in The Practice of Management, sets a managerial thought that guides us to reflect about the challenge of productivity:

> *"Finally, productivity is vitally affected by organization structure and by the balance between the various activities within the business. If, for lack of clear organization, managers waste their time trying to find out what they are supposed to do rather than doing it, the company's scarcest resource is being wasted. "* (Drucker, 1986, p. 45)

* Review ( ) Marcio Digs into the "Doing it" of Peter Drucker, applicable to the entrepreneurial setting of startups, which would mean, organizing, the meta. In foreword, in the paragraph that uses Peter Drucker's quote to add clarity, the point of question, complication, has to do with the meaning of the word "doing" as the setting of startups the doing is unknown. Right, there, of course, when in the face of uncertainty, what remains valid can be as simple as split your time to reflect 50%.  @8ab346b4-699e-4066-855d-f342ba599cc9 

--> 

It is a perspective that prompts us to consider the complications for any kind of organization. If we don't know what to do, and if we are "trying to find out what they are supposed to do," then we are not productive. On the other hand, although it is ethical to be productive and advance, the context of a startup involves navigating a path of uncertainty. In other words, the possibility of a paradox might rise - what can I do if I don't know how to do? However, if we respect the situation of startups, the level of uncertainty, and the essence of Drucker's thought, we should confront the reality that doing it posits a call for organization, for reflective thinking, which naturally frames the constituents, such as founders, and the team, to respect themselves as beings that produce the entrepreneurs. In other words, if we become preoccupied with not waste the team, the vital force, it implies that we need to determine a code of conduct, such as that we are not gambling with these resources. In other words, the top priority goes to the people involved, which includes respecting their time, their willpower, their mental health, and their well-being. Thus, in the light of Peter Drucker's thought, when not knowing where you are going, respect the self, the team, and the goal or the matter ahead. Which naturally calls for the need for clear organization. How would this translate in a more realistic example? If a solo founder, willing to enter a field where she has no idea what to do, should acknowledge that part of the work involves spliting time, such as to allow a conscious organization, and reflective management, to be applicable as part of the work time. In other words, if entrepreneurs don't have a clear roadmap on how to proceed (which is natural in the innovation process,) there is a natural need for organizing the process which starts with the initiative to reflect on the act of entrepreneurship and the activities of entrepreneurship. In other words, it is valid, if not vital, for them to be concerned with "the balance between the various activities." 

In other words, if we consider Peter's thought on top of the startup situation, it will provoke us to reducing the action of moving fast. Or better, sets a call for splitting the usage of time which allows room for reflective thinking and reasoning about how things are going. This book exercises that view. But it does so in the light of the lighting speed and networked situation of modern entrepreneurship. In other words, we will start from the "ongoing conversation," from being inside the train, and try to jump out of it, to look from outside. In other words, we are to recognize the environment of modern entrepreneurship that empowers us for action and guiding us in many ways. 

Now, and before we put step towards the introduction, I invite you to consider a visit to when things started to change, to when fast-paced seemed to walk into our world. Then, we shall briefly visualize the world of abundance we caught ourselves into, where the urgencies of our environment sets much of what we do, where attention is limited; and how even the generalist role of an entrepreneur that is now harassed by information overload with all sorts of solutions which are powerful in the sense of boosting them but also becomes challenging and obfuscates their ability to manage what they do. In this regard, we start our mindful instrospection about the entrepreneurial ventures of valuing and respecting the beings and their ability to tame entrepreneurship. 

Now, as for the environment and the accelerated pace of the world, or how the acceleration started to change our way of thinking and acting in the world, I invite you to set our time machine to November 10, 1876. On this date, the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, activated [^editornote_check_activated] a massive steam engine at the inauguration of the centennial exhibition of the United States' independence in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. This milestone symbolizes the onset of new era, perhaps when the people's clock became faster. The engine, named the Corliss Centennial Engine, became the icon of the exhibition. Standing 14 meters tall and boasting a power of 1400 horse-power, it was responsible for powering the entire exhibition setup, which encompassed more than 200 buildings spread over 5 km in length. (Wikipedia, 2019)

[^editornote_check_activated]: Editor note: Check the word "activated" from the book of Maury Klein, The Power Makers. 

![Illustration of the Corliss Engine, public domain.](images/100/CentennialEngine.png)

According to historian Maury Klein (2008), the exhibition showcased all the modern wonders of the mechanization of the industrial revolution: machines that prepared molds for printing machines, sewing machines, telegraph devices, locomotives, automatic saws, belt presses, winches, scales, excavators, drilling machines, giant sugarcane mills, cotton presses, stone-crushing machines, diamond drills, stone cutters, various tools, agricultural equipment, carriages, tile and brick-making machines, bookbinding machines, paper-making machines, cardboard, machines for making threads, cables, screws, car wheels, train wheels, and so much more. Machines. I know, it might seem too much to name 26 examples - that now seem antiquated - instead of focusing on big numbers, such as 200 buildings, or the 14 meters steam engine, or the 5 kilometers lenght of the exhibition, or the 10 million visitors, or the 7 days time which one would take to visit the whole exhibition. A bit antiquated for us but nevertheless amusing in size and impact, especially for the ones who experienced the exposition and had a chance to see revolutionary solutions in many sorts of fields as all of these things were new. 

These solutions, much of it materialized as mechanical solutions, were fruits of human work and collaboration at the epicenter of a destruction to an economic order heavily based on slavery. The rising new economic model were supported by technological innovations that redefined rules of labor force that went along with societal changes in the system and shaped a new economy. The situation in the United States, the north vs. south confrontation, illustrated the advancement of the new order and how it deconstructed a present economic order where slavery persisted. As these worlds collided, the industrial revolution defined the economic context that accelerated the destruction of the old system based on slavery and gave rise to a new system that brought more freedom and innovation. This new pace, a new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come.

[^footnote_creativedestruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development.

To better illustrate the formation of a new platform, consider the flour mill created by American inventor Oliver Evans around 1790. Evans' automatic mill [^footnote_oliverevans_mill] was innovative as it eliminated numerous hours of human work and at the same time reduced the risk of contamination. 

![Evan's design for the automated flour mill](images/100/Oliver_Evans_-_Automated_mill.jpg)

[^footnote_oliverevans_mill]: The illustration of Evans' automatic mill, which is in the public domain, was made by James Poupard and documented in the work titled "The Young Mill-Wright & Miller's Guide."

The new entrepreneurial order, born from the process of Creative Destruction, broke the rules of the "previous game" but at the same time established new rules, and a new economic and social order. And with that, room is being made for the next cycle. Therefore, this very example depicts how innovative solutions responded as viable, or were favored, in the face of the historical context of the dismantling of a system based on slavery. 

And back to the future, in front of a new order, we have different challenges that prevents, or provokes, entrepreneurs from making the world a better place. Challenges that prevents and conversely creates the opportunity. Therefore, if we look at entrepreneurship from the lenses of creative destruction, we shall first recognize that revolutions are set in a way that rewrite the platform, and history, or act as a macroeconomic force that unbundles the reality, then bundling comes our new as new economic platforms, which enables a reality that might provoke us to either comform, and accept the rules, or join the call for unbundling again and seeking opportunities. In other words, our celebration for what brought us to be here, after cycles of the Creative Destruction process, is less about celebrating all the aspects of the world as we have inherited. In other words, it is undeniable that live in a world that needs help, as we look at the macro outset, our planet's horizon, and the rise in diseases linked to diet, the rise of unhealthy lifestyle, the rise of stress, or the destruction of our nature, and even general attention loss of people. The celebration can be turned for respecting how big are the consequences of any revolutinary platform that changes the economic order, and our lives, as in the raise the respect for "the size of the beast" which might help us to put order, or to be aware, for how much we can be stick into a societal and economic reality, for good or bad. 

Let us consider, back to the future and a few chapters ahead in the history told by Creative Destruction, how people behave and interact in the modern hyperconnected world is certain an area that deserves reflection - an area that shows opportunities but it is challenging. Consider information access, for example, the contrast of a visitor of that 1876 exhibition, where an entire week was needed to fully appreciate it and where only the 10 million who could physically travel to Philadelphia were able to see firsthand the possibilities of a more automated world. Today, with large exhibitions extinct, people are bombarded with #hashtags and stories through the social media walls of their "smart phones." The irony is that although we can literally walk through hallways of an exhibition which is cheap and continuous, and it not difficult to be guided by the an experience, likely powered by an algorithm, that can literally take us into a tesseract of infinite possibilities including to be stuck in the dimension of the food carts. Today, we can find ourselves immersed in a surreal abundance of images, stories, and projections, and a lot more that captivates us with increasingly better sensational narratives, sometimes visceral. But how could we blame abundance, right? Since it is possible to find the right moment in time and space where opportunity to change our future exists for all. Still, although much of what arises every second is promising, one problem with navigating the digital space is that the visitor can navigate alone, or in the company of a algorithmic guide that favors instints such as to take them to be stuck in the "icecream cart" of the exposition and unable to reach out to new themes. 

In other words, from abundance there is also the price of turbulence in the hyperconnected space which might set us to become less apt to engage in deeper reflections as we compelled to experience things superficially. Consider how a visitor, when accessing social media, is captivated into an experience that invites them to jump from section to section, page to page, message to message, too quickly and without time to digest. 

In this context, journalist Johann Hari, in "Stolen Focus," challenges us to reflect on how the overexposure to information generally reduces our attention: According to a study cited in the book, and published in the journal Nature (Hari, p.39-40, 2023), we can understand that social media contributes to decreased attention the more we are exposed to larger amounts of content. In other words, althought it seems that social media - as it is today - is to be blamed, in doing so should consider the wider view of the systems and platforms that enabled more information to reach out to every human - the internet, the telecommunications revolution, the telegraph, and the various means of transport that delivered letters. 

> "Foi a primeira prova obtida de que o espectro de nossa atenção coletiva vem encolhendo. Um fato crucial é que isso está acontecendo não apenas desde o surgimento da web, mas ocorreu durante toda a minha vida, a vida dos meus pais e dos meus avós. Sim, a internet trouxe uma rápida aceleração da tendência - mas o fato crucial é a descoberta feita por essa equipe científica de que esta não é a única causa." (Hari, p.40, 2023).

Therefore, we are in a paradoxal situation. Because despite the turbulence and potential confusion, we have so much more information and tools of unquestionable quality in front of us, more accessible and cheaper. This should be a factor that promotes an optimistic view, for better chances. And if you dig, it is quite rational as we must agree that we now have much more data, more stories, more references, more tools, more means of interaction, more for growth, and even more. In this regard, we should consider the optimistic view from A16Z, the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley, for where we are going:  

> "We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life."

This situation does not put the entrepreneur out of the opportunities and risk in of the party. In other words, in front of a explosion of solutions - like processes, tools, methodologies, systems, and more - our attention can be limited and we might be pressured to act, to judge, to decide. The ecosystem of entrepreneurship is what gives us the chance and at the same time can be the trap. One thing we know - we are compelled to move fast, with decisions, and informed decisions. But also superficial analysis will find our way. 

#### Entrepreneurial action bundled 

However, entrepreneurs who try to execute their processes are also equally fit to operate in the current economic environment or platform, for instance, continuing the accelerated movement where prioritization of execution is the motto. This is not just because they can't see that they are victims of the economic system, but because they genuinely see many opportunities in the economic system as it stands. In other words, there are no compelling reasons - such as the evident chaos of a decaying society - that could help them see why to change. Under these conditions, it's not easy to recognize the pace at which the entrepreneurial system conditions them, especially in a hyperconnected environment, faced with a plethora of technologies, tools, methods, approaches, systems - all promising to support decisions and introduce solutions into the current machinery.

Another aspect of concern has to do with the situation where the generalist mindset falls into a mechanized approach for entrepreneurship in the face of the urgent, frenetic, fast-paced, world of entrepreneurship; where being faster is more like a response for the abundance of solutions that seem coherent and which goes well with good reasons to decide fast; as in the movement of an entrepreneur moves to being about moving around the aisles, or categories, in a huge supermarket of solutions for how to do it, such as cheaply acessible knowledge, access to thoughts of role models, stories, research data, lists of prospects, methodologies, vouchers to support systems, tickets to acceleration systems, boosters, passes, gift cards, free coupons, invitations to investors, and more. Although the abundance is a challenge, we can't blame the supermarket for its options and the abundance; as what is out there on the shelves is backed by information that makes sense. As in, if one had the time to check the cover, one will find the appropriate nutritional information. In other words, an entrepreneur is well equipped to get into a premium supermarket where many solutions are socially approved by the regulating community, the entrepreneurial ecosystem. They are also equipped to ask their friendly online search engine doctor.  

We, as entrepreneurs, who strive to change the world and our lives, recognize the complexities of navigating a stormy sea. But like any environment that needs to change, we don't have time to adjust our routine. We are bound to the pace of acceleration, to the urgent drumbeat, the pressure for decision. We are pushed to decide, to move forward. Consider, for example, how we are bombarded by a torrent of information, we are immersed in constant overexposure that submerges us in a sea of choices. The channels we subscribe, the "newspapers" we read, and the systems and networks that shape behaviors; with data, with what we think as "good reasons," empowering us to the next step. In this environment, entrepreneurs might see themselves as protagonists, empowered to execute faster with a feeling of certainty to an iminent success; 

In other words, a dive into the situation that we live shows the projections of the current order - as it seems - at all levels which includes influencing the management of entrepreneurship, which makes it not immune to the urgent forces or pressures of the interconnected platforms we live in. Thus, how we act and behave is always a symptom of bring framed, or victim of the accelerated environment, that not only might suck their project's potential but their energy. The ranges of what can go on with the too fast mover goes from wasting resources to just launching things that are not useful on top of existing platforms without reconsidering that a lot of what is out there is a created reality in the first place.  

#### Why for entrepreneurs, what kind of 

But why a book geared towards entrepreneurs? First, because we are all entrepreneurs, even if we're just navigating our own lives. Second, entrepreneurs who strive to better the world are the ones genuinely in need to improve entrepreneurship itself. In other words, the impact of entrepreneurship feeds back into a more appropriate approach to both entrepreneurship and management. This book, for instance, arose from my learning experiences rooted in the work of individuals - such as managers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners - who inspired me as they champion a more conscious form of entrepreneurship. Thus, this book is a culmination of lessons learned, but it also stands as an accessible resource, an organized body of knowledge, spurring debate. Even though it might be finalized in editions, it remains fluid in terms of knowledge and inspiration in a broader discussion. Third, according to Maslow (1998, p.232), entrepreneurs warrant attention because they play key roles in societies:

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)

Maslow's message reinforces a perspective of an entrepreneur as a role that transcends other specialists roles and in fact can support anyone. In this regard, support for the entrepreneurial role is support for a reflective moment as an opportunity to  understanding of navigation, organization, productivity, and conscious entrepreneurship. For entrepreneurs, interested in being around, for their lasting business or as professionals. A call for slowing down has more to do with the needs reflective character that respects the self, and respect the new cycles too. It is by respecting creative destruction process, its powerful magnificent power - that solidifies a reality that recycles the economic order - is about respecting the new order, the new platofrm, new rules; up to the point of recognizing the abundance of options of now, modern entrepreneurship, and including any traps we might be into it. We are bundled in the package of now. Respect that what destroyed, prior order, was creatively destroyed. Respect that first shall lead us to respect ourselves as the beings that can free ourselves. See, it is not easy to see the needs to free ourselves which might lead to innovation, truly. In order to see problems, you have to be into the reflective state to see things as problematic. I have considered that, with the many resources that were light to my perosnal path, brought me to see the bundled situation, the fworld; and a need for us to move our entrepreneurship with a willingness to unbundle things, such as the pathways of entrepreneurship. 

This moment of reflection becomes urgent because the act of entrepreneurship starts with motivation but generates the potential for action towards innovation. I am grateful that you are engaging with this material, as the articles gathered here promote conscious entrepreneurship in this era of urgencies and pitfalls that besiege the act of embarking on entrepreneurial ventures. This brief pause is for the entrepreneur to become a better protagonist and less a victim of the world's pressing agendas. In this sense, it provides support so that we can navigate towards our dreams without inadvertently becoming victims of the accelerated environment of entrepreneurship, which can be cruel and devastating.
