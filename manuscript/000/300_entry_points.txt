## Procrastination 

* temp chatgpt on isolated, individual and "his mind" in judgement  - Self-Procrastination Isolated from Social Pressure: It's theoretically possible for an individual to procrastinate in isolation, driven purely by internal cognitive or emotional factors without any social or community influence. For instance, a writer in solitude might delay writing due to personal fears or insecurities, even without any external deadline or societal pressure. However, in most real-world scenarios, a mix of internal and external factors contributes to procrastination. - https://chat.openai.com/share/2c74d31e-73de-4c30-b387-f606148c7e2c

* Procrastination and analysis paralysis - ChatGPT brought the possibility, after my prompt research on procrastination "with merits" that analysis paralysis could be a sort of procrastination. "Analysis Paralysis: This is when someone becomes so overwhelmed by the options and data available that they fail to make a decision or take action. It's a form of procrastination where the person is stuck in the planning or analyzing phase without moving forward." - https://chat.openai.com/share/2c74d31e-73de-4c30-b387-f606148c7e2c

* Procrastination and fear of failure - "Fear of Failure: At the root of many procrastination tendencies, especially in startups and business ventures, is the fear of failure. People sometimes avoid challenging tasks because they fear the outcome if they don't succeed. This fear can be paralyzing, leading to inaction." -  - https://chat.openai.com/share/2c74d31e-73de-4c30-b387-f606148c7e2c

* Procrastination and perfectionism - "Perfectionism: Some people procrastinate because they want everything to be perfect. They might avoid starting a task or project because they're waiting for the "perfect" time or the "perfect" resources. This can be a major obstacle in businesses and startups, where agility and adaptability are often more valuable than perfection." https://chat.openai.com/share/2c74d31e-73de-4c30-b387-f606148c7e2c

* Procrastination and heroic movements - It could be that entrepreneurs shift the matter of the work, sometimes, as in not continuuing, for the sake of finding another good reason to work - check 600_emotions_and_identity.txt, the case of "The superhero" pointed by Melissa. 

## 2 months or 2 years

* ( ) -> "Time is relative"

* Feat. John Lilly, perhaps he  brought that up in Blitzscaling. 

## Effort vs. outcomes 

* Check the situation, where we can talk, about effort, and when we measure by effort, which refers to the book of Jonathan and Melissa. 

## Solitude 

* An article that Marcio wrote and has communicated with Fabricio, that has the word solitude in it. Check that as it promotes a view that being alone is not alone, which connects with Julia Cameron. 

## UI distracting, parallel stories of apps, and the park of apps 

* And the situation which has happened to me drive us into the complex interface of modern systems, such as mobile devices. The situation with mobile devices is incredibly more complex than what used to be the PC. That because apps are always running, and they are all open, all the time. Notifications from Whatsapp, from the sms system, from Instagram, from Facebook, from email, Google Calendar (the many calendars). In addition, browsers also have their own notification systems, it's a hell of events all the time.

* (100_space.txt) Marcio and the Google Well-being app - (title: The lost world of apps) For weeks now I am using the Well-being app by Google, quite interesting name, which allows an interesting option, it enables me to check off, turn off, all Android apps. This case helps to make the point about the competition of UI elements, and also the "organized flow" of certain events, such as notifications, that comes my way with a small screen device. Since the Android is more connected, modern, the Android has more connections with knowing what all apps do, and channels it, controls it. The safety of the marketplace, which generate trust to use, retro feed the trust of actions to be in the control of Google, and then all that has permissions, then becomes like habits that are system-level. Consideing that the device is a sort of extension of my body at this point - which is likely not unfair to say, then the impact, the extension is receiving notifications for all the sort of things, such as messages from family, friends, bank notifications, entertainment, leisure, system updates, social network updates. It's like all the birds of a country are sent over my tour all together. Or, if you were visiting a Jurassic Park, if they give you all the dinossaurs at the same time. Wait, let me run from the t-rex first, then have an icecream, then go back to face the velociraptor. The system-level attachment with multiple stories of all the apps which I have subscribed - and note that installing is a form of subscription too - can't account the storied context of all the apps in synch with my own storied context. I would need my grandmother to help me as my parents are busy too. But I am alone and I am no composer or conductor. It's a lot of noise if you could hear all events of updates as dinossaurs screams. 

* (100_space.txt)  when I was reading the book entitled Foco Roubado, Stolen Focus, and the story of the 66 yo professor researcher in the field of willpower, Roy Baumeister, author of Willpower, and reading what Roy told him Johann, that the professor used to be able to seated, reading and writing, and not anymore; that now he thinks that his mind jumps a lot more from one activity to another; it reminded me of my great insightful experience that I have called Uber University, when I became an Uber driver for one year, for 1000 trips. The insight I found was that u was able to replace the radio with YouTube videos. I have told passengers that I was learning English and if they were okay with the audio. Then then, long story short, only on Fridays, I was able to watch about 120 talks. Yes I had to polish a process, over time, such as to put a bit of effort to curate my playlist, not perfect but making sure I went to the streets with about 10 talks in the same theme. Then I wrote about that amazing experience of productivity. I have reported, later trying to convince many Uber drivers to do that, that it didn't take many months for me to think I was a sort of expert in the field of entrepreneurship. When explaining to many other app drivers, as we call them in Brazil, many have agreed that on the computer, or a mobile screen, the user interface offers too many notification systems on our way. I miss the days of driving and just listening and sometimes replaying parts of the audio talks as they were full of insights. The app driver university pack I created could work like an university.

## Animated systems UI and happiness

* We do have an article about things as animated, such as products in a store, such as a sweet. And in that regard, I have presented the fact that these things are talking to us now. 

Now, when I wrote the draft of the story about the happiness pot, and used my imagination, and not a lot of observation, to sense the idea that the item were talking, communicating, giving the customer good reasons to be eaten, I didn't properly, or fully, couldn't see a connection with other too books that I was reading at that time. One was "amigos da mente" which gives us a good idea about the damage that we live, in the current world we life, where good gut bacteria is not promoted as brings in our gut, and in contrast, other bacteria took place, bacteria that in excess does not make good gut , it damages a lot of things in our lives; and the gut populated with that bacterias in excess are fully connected with the excessive eating of gluten and sweet things. Now, now clearly. The world I am in, as I walk and approach public spaces, pulls me to buy, to do the transaction, the sweets are dancing. And that dance promotes not only the engagement with them but also the habit of eating them many times during the week. It is as if the producers achieved the highest possible performance level of a situation that pushes us naturally to fall: the cheapest possible ingredients, the more addictive as possible, full of sugar and colors, arranged in a way that talks. It is like it's now socialized, they entered the network, the brain network and more.  These sweets, pizzas, like the crazy sweet pizza, are everywhere and also in the digital space. They talk with us. The closest thing I used to see about a talking, communicative, food was the quite common display of happy porks or a happy cow displayed as the logo of butcher stores. Quite odd, I used to think.  As in, that pork isn't happy. That chicken isn't happy. That cow isn't happy. But that was a logo. What has changed over time is that the chicken thighs started to talk with us, in the menu boards, menus, digital qrcode based menus, store displays, social networks. Properly feeding the networks, pulsing for us in the augmentation of what used to be physical displays. 

The communication, the appeal, storytelling, call it whatever you want, puts the product in the mouth of the user, teases as one click prevent them from having it. It retro feeds the feed. Plus, the world has evolved too. Now the story of consumption for these things evolve in time. There is a managemnt system, an accounting system, an storytelling based system, a narrative system, a rewards system. 

The producer, the seller, has reached the level of acting in the algorithm basis too. Likely much easier to advertise a video for your sweet pizza extravaganza for users that are addicted to pizza. 

So the mechanism, as indicated by Johann Hari, the new display, went online. But what has happened is beyond the digitalization. It is a mechanism that pushes these live products in the front of the right people in the right time. The ones that can't get even turn off their addiction anymore. 

 P 20 of Johann has inspired Márcio to relate social networks with the animated products.

[^infinitelearner]: Reid Hoffman, cofundador do LinkedIn, na entrevista intitulada "Blitzscaling 18: Brian Chesky on Launching Airbnb and the Challenges of Scale", se refere a Brian Chesky como um aprendiz infinito. O termo que ele usa é "infinite learner" e ele aponta que é chave para o sucesso no processo de gestão de start-ups que buscam escalar. https://youtu.be/W608u6sBFpo?t=3635
