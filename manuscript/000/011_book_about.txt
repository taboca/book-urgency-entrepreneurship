In today's entrepreneurial world, founders and teams are overwhelmed with options and face constant pressure to move quickly, execute, and be productive. As they seek guidance from the startup ecosystem, they often try to "scale their way up" by opting for solutions that appear to pave the way to success.

While there's undeniable value in moving fast, learning quick, failing fast, pivoting, and the like; the journey often leaves little room for reflective thinking and to gain broader perspectives about the entrepreneurial activities and behaviors from the doers. The result is not always a failure that leads to success but it may too bring about waste of the most precious resources, team's time and energy; and moreover motivation, willpower and creativity.

"Slow Down to Start Up" starts by asking us the courage to slow down and the the recognition that time spent in reflective thinking is valuable and has to be valued as actual work time. Although it may seem costly, it's less expensive than continuously trying and failing and being lost in the overwhelming and abundant world of solutions that aren't asking us to call to action. What we win from this reflective journey, is the recognition that management of execution is worth and essential to any entrepreneurial activity.
