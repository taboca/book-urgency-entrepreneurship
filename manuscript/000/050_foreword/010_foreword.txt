Who is this author? Am I a qualified entrepreneur? I am certainly not a qualified practitioner, or an investor, or even a qualified software engineer which was the formal title I got when I moved to Silicon Valley. When I wondering why that iconic [^footnote_netscape] company had hired an unqualified software engineer that could not speak proper English it comes to my mind the facet of my unqualified artist. But I share something with entrepreneurs and many of these characters who are generally interested in helping them. I'm sympathetic to the cause. When I wear my founder helmet, which I did many times, I had seen a promising ground, like a salt lake flat. I had put gas in the tank, focused my energy to accelerate. I hacked my own motorcycle, forged its pistons by hand, and polished its unqualified tires. Like many others, I haved crossed an ocean, in terms of time anyway. And arrived there, I wanted to be timed or validated. And perhaps to break the world’s record too. But too, like other founders who aren't different from sport professionals and real artists, I was also in for the ride. I share these values. 

[^footnote_netscape]: Background note - I were invited to work for the then-iconic company known as Netscape after a longer period of attempts, having arrived around 2000 with the official tittle were software engineer although I hired to be technology evangelist to help Netscape's marketing.

From that situation we know a few things. That we look for love - for good things to happen like growth and opportunity. And too that we don't have time for tears. But we know too that we want to make it, that we can make it if we try. But between us  - just the two of us - there is a conversation that we shouldn't wait too long. It's starts with that road ahead of us. I invite you to take a seat, take a deep breath, and picture a founder, you or a founder you care. She is now inside that screen, in the video clip, on a desert with her luggage. And she is eager to take that ride, the real ride, so she waves her thumbs up to the passers. Many of them are coming, all interested, all offering that ride. With their shiny machines they seem pretty smart, pretty right, some even think they are geniuses. Now, from your safer seat, we can get things, how that don't impress us much. But from the arena, we can see, how she struggles by the impressions they cause. And how they drive her up the wall. Who are they? They are the folks carring on the building blocks, qualified tools and methods. They are the potential mentors, potential advisors, potential practitioners, potential investors, potential marketeers, incubators, accelerators, you name it. They are all interested and eager to give her that ride.

Can we, or should we blame what we have? Well, it's tough, we know. Because while it appears to be chaotic, they are quite passive, not aggressive. All in all, we know, they are just another brick. From far, it is fair to consider the perpective, the optimistic one, from Marc Andreesseen, the founding partner of A16Z, the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley. Marc reminds us that abundance does not mean aggressiveness:  

> *"We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life."*  (Andreessen, M., A16z, 2023)

That can't be missed. Indeed, it looks like a supermarket, one hyperconnected and networked, one which is abundant and cheap. So when I put on again that founder helmet and my hands on the cart, there I go, optimistic. It's inescapable, to feel that raise, a raise in entrepreneurial action, one which take us through the aisles. And these are now aisles for all our startup needs for all the job steps [^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap] of the job we know that has to be done. It set us to be literally equipped, literally augmented, literally empowered to run into the process. 

[^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap]: In the article "Mapping the Job-to-be-Done" (Ulwick, 2017), Tony Ulwick defines job map as an "ideal process flow" that customers go through as they are involved in a job to be done. The steps are: Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude. The main point of the job map is to help the deconstruction of a job that customers are trying to get done, thus with the understanding of customer needs, before considering the opportunities in terms of products or solutions. With that said, I have drawn an analogy from this concept - due to its underlying universality - to provoke us to consider that if the very job of the entrepreneurial is yet another job to be done and conversely many solutions exists: methods, tools, platforms, and more.

#### In the arena 

It is hard to blame the environment. If that is good or bad, or, bright or evil, that's how it goes in real life. We know that we are in to break signal from noise, to put on and off that helmet, to think through. That is how we get the credit, from the arena. Plus we know of the needs to learn faster, that we are challenged to be fast learners. Plus we know what it feels to take that helmet off - watching many other runners passing. Plus we know of the challenges and what it means to do that, how far we can go, how philosophical to get, and to wonder if what we see is real or not. 









<!--
@outline - in and out 
--> 


Let us consider the explosion of accelerators in the world of founders. I will tell you of a particular experience, from 2016 when I had joined a Silicon Valley-based accelerator program that landed in my city in Brazil. My interest started with a background check about the program' reputation. It took me 15 minutes to do that plus a 2-hour inspiring lecture. The accelerator's CEO seemed well-connected. They also had a well-known startup in their account. Things were looking coherent so I wanted to check their educational resources. All were quality stuff, check, in synch with the modern start-up theories. I leaned towards. I did some initial tests, a screening process, and sent my résumé. Then I was awarded a sponsorship which saved me from the tuition fee. Check, check, check, I got a bagde of an aspiring founder, so 3,2,1, take off. The ride went on for one, two, and three weeks, and then I was a drop out. That came about because command control gave me a penalty - a homework. That was an opportunity for me to course-correct a movement I have done wrong. I couldn't really figure the point of the homework but in terms of evidence it had to do with a bad score from a presentation pitch event, plus some of my behaviors. At the time, in terms of my excuses to drop, I didn't like the homework.  






<!--
@outline - grief 
--> 

Now, as we know, many reflections happens after real complications, like rocket explosions, or from post-mortem exercises. I was mad and wanted to blame them. Then I was energetic and wanted to figure things out. From that incident, or accident, perhaps I took a bargain. I took off that helmet and may have entered a rabbit role. One that took me to be here with you and not continue my start-up project. If this sounds like the phases of one experiencing a major loss, it's not a coincidence. Perhaps this whole book relates to that although in the context of entrepreneurship. Perhaps this foreword is a prelude to a requiem, the startup's requiem or the founder's requiem that takes place before evolving a startup.  










<!-- 
@outline - living the denial 
--> 




Anyway, and while being mad, or living that phase of denial, I started to dig from what had happened. Why my pitch wasn't good? I was mad because it seemed that their program, from that initial lecture, had motivated me with a bold and global idea. But them, when it was time to judge, they seemed to favor things with a strong local market bias, as in Brazil's market if not the region where my city is located. I were forging a conspiration theory. My hint into that had to do with required me to think of three different ideas, and to pitch them to get feedback, and then to stick to one. I noticed that when some of the advisors loved my 3rd best idea which had to do with something to split bills of student groups drinking beer in pubs. Right there I felt a problem as my weakest idea (to my eyes which by the way were the one I had less connection with) seemed to be the best. And worse, that my other idea, which I thought were the best and the one which I referred as "yet another slides platform," wasn't hot to them. 

As you may guess, I wasn't so sure about that. I was mainly there, in the arena, coming up with some soft guesses and being in a space of frustration. I sensed too - besides market attachment - that other teams that had more cofounders and more advanced products or solutions, were moving along with better traction. Another thing that seemed to be complex, or weird, was that the directors and mentors had a stake from the startup pie - from the 3% given to the program. So I thought that some of them would perhaps push further the ones more promising to give financial reward, instead of gambling with bold and weird or global ideas likely not possible. 

As an aside, a couple years later and yet feeling that pain, I came across a research paper in 2019, entitled *How do accelerators select startups? Shifting decision criteria across stages* (Yin & Luo, 2018), which gave me a bit of clarity about my conspiration theory that some accelerators were too biased by current markets and other professional characterizations of teams. To be fair, the paper supported my conspiration theory but at the same time supported the position of the accelerator. Yes, they had to filter by quantitative aspects first, like number of founders or traction with the market, using data before subjective and qualitative analysis. But that too had supported some of my views which took me to coin the "filter-first think-later effect." In other words, I was clearly involved in a phase of denial, escapism, or bargain.

Before moving on, at the time I also I sensed some characterizations of a show going on, like a reality show. As an example, one day I pointed to the director who were giving a lecture that a homework as presented by him had a difference with the homework as specified in the book. To which he had energetically replied that "we are not in an university," which brought my fellow entrepreneurs - not to say students - to laugh quite hard from the back of the room, not to say class. I didn't understand what happened but in a way that brought me back to 16 years ago to the days when I did university. Nevertheless, I had a puzzle being formed, or a paradox, or a gap, a dissonance, or a dichotomy, something different.

@outline - Blitzscaling 
--> 


#### Moving on 


So I kept moving on, a bit confused. Is it the movement? Is it the program? Is it myself? In other words, a new phase of learning was going on. This is when the Blitzscaling lectures came my way - a work which turned out to be an inflection point in my life and one of the results of that is this book. I had paid attention to Blitzscaling because of many reasons. At the time, my motivations seemed to have a connection with the organizers, to the folks interviewed, and with Silicon Valley in terms of love and hopes and from having worked there. But too because of John Lilly. A decade ago John were the CEO of Mozilla, when I was the only employee from Brazil. I didn't know much about John but something he said touched me profoundly - something from a video discussion where he and an UX expert were discussing the future of Firefox. The expert made a point, that a perfect tool consists of the actual problem solved, as in when the actual tool is not on the way of the problem. That was super coherent. But John made another point, that through the development of tools, imperfect tools included, teams could make better tools. That was profoundly coherent. I had especially loved that conversation because although it was a video, live and public, it was heated and honest. To watch those senior leaders presenting different views in a quite honest setting was quite the opposite of what I have seen from that real situation - no video being recorded - which I characterized as a reality show. Through LinkedIn, I asked John Lilly to help me to get the subtitles since I wanted to translate to portuguese. I got the subtitles in 2016, recruited a couple friends and we started. Needless to say but worth observing, that when we are subtitling we are watching in slow motion. So we did the first, an interview with Brian Chesky, and the second, the interview with Nirav Tolia. These amazing lectures were changing my life. Now were the talks amazing because they were amazing or because I was engaged in a slow learning process? Yes. And that is how it goes in real life. 


Now here it comes the 3rd talk. I wasn't following an order and somehow I picked one that was quite unconventional from the others. While most where interviews this one was a bit odd, not to say eccentric. It is a half lecture and a half interview. But that was when I got to know a special person - Silicon Valley investor and professor Michael Dearing. From this point on I would say that another inflection point where forming while the subtitling project pausing, my "slides platform" becoming learning project, and new perspectives from Blitzscaling rising. As an aside, at this point my start-up consisted of a tool to clip [^footnote_fastclip] these and other Youtube videos with annotations. From Michael's lecture, and digging into Harrison Metal's content, I was caught by insights combining management and entrepreneurship and some precious lectures, such as *Two Blasts From the Past*, *Executive Communications*, and his *General Management 2 course about OKR*. Michael were becoming a conductor for enlightened views to the tracks I were laying. I wrote to Michael to say thanks, many times, too many times. From Michael's materials, I met other great minds, like Barbara Minto. I wrote to Barbara too, to say thanks, had the opportunity to meet her through video. Plus she sent to me her book, *The Minto Pyramid Principle*, another turning point in my life.

@outline - Back to complication 
--> 


#### The dilemma 


Back to the problem, the puzzle, now a dilemma. Blitzscaling were giving me a viewpoint about the accelerated world (of startups) and the reflective characterizations of great leaders. As a lightning strike, I had found peace between the fast and slow world, where values and principles could actually be use to shock-absorb the fast-paced mind in order to help startups to grow. It was different, to consider Blitzscaling as a framework, and to see the connections between scalable startups and a style of leadership very different from that local accelerator program. Of course, it is unfair to compare, starting with the fact that one were a practical program and the other mostly lectures organized with things in perspective. But right there is part of the puzzle - that a lot of people may watch some of what I call top-tier lectures and ignore points of it as in when they think that things from there might not be entirely true. I didn't watch Blitzscaling with that point of view. Perhaps it had to do with that video from John. 

The contrast for me was clear. As an example, when I wrote a letter to that accelerator's program director, asking a word about why they gave me that specific punishment homework, his answer were "just do it." On the other hand, although the Blitzscaling lectures were essentially about fast growth or startup growth, their reflections through the interviews valued the reflective experience, carried values and principles. How I were navigating my reflections about Blitzscaling seemed to be, although I didn't see at the time precisely, a quest to understand the self, the being, a quest to understand the characterizations of leaders that could actually do that sort of thing. 

At this stage, I had two circles on my way. One that actual practical program living the realities which I felt that were too fast too confusing and perhaps a bit artificial. On the other hand, the Blitzscaling circle with some of the above characterizations. But another circle was right in the middle of them, the lean circle. Here is where the name Steve Blank appears. First, because Steve is the father of the lean startup movement, along with Eric Ries of course. Second, because the lean methods were exactly being activelly used in the arena by founders alone or within startup tracks. Now Steve is especially special here because of his values. After clipped - or slow-watching - some of his talks I could not avoid noticing his reflective mindset. I had noticed Steve's concerns about the actual use of lean, how lean methods were being used or misused, his views about the behaviors of founders when doing it. Moreover, he kept on as a learner, evolving by learning and evolving his views. As an example, Steve cared to talk about a situation when founders engage in what he sees as being procrastinating with lean, when they claim to be using lean but aren't. Steve kept on engaged, and attentive, to when founders were lost, or less conscious. Steve kept on alert about the meaning of the market too. In terms of misuses of lean, or the complexity of using lean, Eric Ries had also understood a phenomenon where many engage with lean and miss the view of purpose. Another plus, about Steve, had to do with his considerations that founders are not so different from artists.  




It was becoming clear, that dilemma, between the produced echoes of Silicon Valley (by narratives, tools, methods, platforms, and accelerated networking systems) driven by pressures of our accelerated world, with the possibility of a value-system seriously being considered by top-tier leaders, not only entrepreneurs but the executive leaders of grown-up organizations brought by Blitzscaling, plus the leading practitioners who cared about the misuses and behaviors. From that I also sense, that top leaders were calmer, were people that reads more, or not so strict in terms of following frameworks. More aware. While, on the other hand, the anxiety of entrepreneurs (or whowever supports them) seemed to set themselves to miss, to miss being aware. 

This is the gap I caught myself in which set myself to advance, and to achieve clarity. From that I were helping myself but too felt that a point of view could be helpful to others. Let us say that the audience is the entrepreneurial spirit in us. We know, from now today, that entrepreneurs are critical to our future. This view goes along with a view according to Maslow (1998, p.232), of entrepreneurs unique place: 

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)


For a second, if we are too fast, we may read Maslow's message from a perspective they they are a kind, as in part from the others. But the actual view from Maslow is one that transcends and one that aligns with views that in all of us there is an entrepreneur. 

But that characterization, help us to see an identity, and to be worried about that gap. But moreover, and in the face of the that accelerated movement, to actually consider the entrepreneur characterization as is endangered exactly because the generalist movement they do might well be taken by a way of doing that can be considered like of a specialized generalist, or mechanized in many ways. 


<!--
@lost 
Now if you're characterized as a part entrepreneur or not fully qualified entrepreneur yet or not fully qualified investor, practitioner, but you are still involved in all this, we are all sharing the same entrepreneurial spirit or we share our interest with the entrepreneurial function, which is that we strive to change the world in our lives. We want to be in the equation, therefore we are aimed to recognize the complex of navigating this stormy sea.
-->


As this reflection is in your way, my hope is that you will see what is out there in different ways. My hope is that our moment, now just the two of us, sets a seed to your path, to your course, one that will grow and spread through the culture of your organization, not just to the two of us. My hope is for us to have this conversation. For me, this book is not different from a perspective I have seen from *What Writers are Like*, from *Becoming a Writer* by Dorothe Brande: 

> *"There are some handbooks so valuable that no writer should be without them. .. This book is not even a companion volume to such works as those; it is a preliminary to them. If it is successful it will teach the beginner not how to write, but how to be a writer; and that is quite another thing."* Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)

<!--

Likewise, this book has no place among the play books that teaches how to execute a startup. But I do think that it works across the board, for all audiences interested in the entrepreneurial world and the startup ecosystem - founders, to practitioners, to investors, to parents of founders, to the future of founders. Thus, it's for entrepreneurs which are beginners but for the grown up others that recognize that the true entrepreneur is always a learner, an apprentice.
