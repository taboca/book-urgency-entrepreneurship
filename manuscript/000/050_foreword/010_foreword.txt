Who is this author? I'm not a qualified entrepreneur. I'm also not a qualified practitioner, or an investor, or even a qualified software engineer which was the formal title I got when I moved to Silicon Valley. Now and wondering how that iconic company [*] had hired an unqualified software engineer that could not speak English, it comes to my mind another facet - of the unqualified artist. But I share something with all of these characters - that I'm sympathetic to their causes, to their movement. When wearing my founder helmet, which I did many times, I had seen a promising ground, like a salt lake flat. I had put gas in the tank, an energy to accelerate, an invitation to run. And I hacked my own motorcycle, forged its pistons by hand, and polished its tires, unqualified. Having arrived there, I wanted to be timed, or validated, perhaps break the world’s record. But too, I knew, I wanted to run, to be there, to accelerate. Founders are not different from qualified sport professionals or qualified artists. They want to break the record, perhaps put a dent in the universe; But they also love to be part of the movement. 

Our environment - of tools, methods, and the social mechanisms - given by this now networked and digital world, sometimes looks like that salt lake flat. They invite us to join and to accelerate. And we know, of the so many things in front of us, an abundant world of solutions, with voices, narratives, tools, methods, platforms, and networks - all which give us a means for interacting and iterating. While it can be overwhelming, we don't see all of that as a flat land meant to slow us down. In reality, what we see, and what we get, are things to boost us, to take us to move even faster. Consider, for example, the cost to access motivation from these networks. We can be thrilled with stories that enlighten our entrepreneurial spirit. On the other hand, consider the tools, or methods, that are proven to advance collaboration. But more than motivation and processes, we are equally able to advance the actual startup using actual networks of support, the interactive spaces where we can get in touch with potential customers, investors, mentors, practitioners, cofounders, partners, and more. 

In this world, there are far many solutions to help us throughout all the process steps [^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap] of the entrepreneurial effort. In other words, the modern entrepreneur is well equipped - if not in a hypermarket of offerings - with solutions to help them from definition into execution and up to conclusion. No way all that there is can or should be thought, as a bad ground for founders and their start ups. Even if their starting journey looks a bit like a desert and quite a lonely place, as soon as they set foot they get to be literally equipped, literally augmented, and literally into a process - which sets them into what it feels to be state of readiness,  feeling energetic and being empowered, and ready to action. 

[^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap]: In the article "Mapping the Job-to-be-Done" (Ulwick, 2017), Tony Ulwick defines job map as an "ideal process flow" that customers go through as they are involved in a job to be done. The steps are: Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude. The main point of the job map is to help the deconstruction of a job that customers are trying to get done, thus with the understanding of customer needs, before considering the opportunities in terms of products or solutions. With that said, I have drawn an analogy from this concept - due to its underlying universality - to provoke us to consider that if the very job of the entrepreneurial is yet another job to be done and conversely many solutions exists: methods, tools, platforms, and more.

But we can't blame, can't we? Because we know that althouth through turbulence and chaos these building blocks are passive, not aggressive. We know that is up to us to use these bricks, when we need, as we need. That is what we do, in that arena, it is how we get our credits, our grades. All in all, we know, they are just another brick for us to build. This situation goes with an optimistic view from Marc Andreesseen - the founding partner of A16Z, the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley - of how abundance correlates to power of action: 

> *"We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life."*  (Andreessen, M., A16z, 2023)

Marc's note take me see our world like a hypermarket, abundant, infinite, colorful, expensive in a way but fastastically cheap, when I wear my consumer hat. But it also takes me into another market when I put on my founder helmet. One which is, again, optimistic. Being there, I feel the raise, a raise in terms of the entrepreneurial power. When I enter it, I feel empowered to run throught the aisles - of tools, methodologies, platforms, networks, and the crowds, and more. All that is given sounds like a given, I know. And all in all, and through the shelves, and to a certain extent, I know that all these things are well qualified.

#### In the arena 

So all of that impact us anyway. From the good side, we have seen, we can run. From the bad side, it may take our attention. And that may be so much that if we pause too watch and see what is there, we may feel paralized in comparisong with us runners. These extremmes would be the case if we could not reason, just jump as if the world if binary. But we, entrepreneurs, aren't machines. We are the doers and we get this credit because, as we know, we are the ones in the arena. So if the ecosystem gives us the opportunity and at the same time can be a trap, that is yet another reason for us to wear the helmet of entrepreneurs and to be in the position of doers that are also learners, to be learning in the arena, from the arena. 

To consider the explosion of accelerators throughout the world, I will tell you of one of my experiences from around 2016, when I had joined a Silicon Valley-based accelerator program that came to my city in Brazil. My application started with a quick background check about the program' reputation. It passed my initial criteria, I may have used 15 minutes plus watched an inspiring lecture which they gave. I also noticed that the accelerator CEO seemed to be well-connected. Plus, they had a well-known startup in their account. With all things coherent going on I did a check with their educational materials. Check there, I found quality stuff in terms of theories, and narrative was sound and seemed to go along with methods and theories which were actively being used by founders and carried over by other and known top-tier Silicon Valley narratives. So I did their initial tests, got a scholarship, and I were in. Having entered the program I caught myself, three weeks after, out of it. 

That came about because the program gave me a penalty, a task, which was a chance for me to course-correct what I have done. I couldn't really figure why that task but it had to do with a bad grade I got from a pitch plus something from my behavior. But the actual reason I left were, initially anyway, due to the homework which they gave it to me which I didn't like. 

Now, as we know, usually, many of our reflections happens in a post-mortem fashion. The first things I did was to be mad, and to blame the problem. First, I noted that program required me to think of three different ideas, to pitch them and get feedback, and to refine. That was weird for me because I suspected that the variability of the ideas and its totally different markets would actually create a sort of complication for myself in terms of values, a potential disconnect of my interest, in case the one receiving best feedback were the one I didn't have the best connection with. In a way, it seemed that the program didn't care about my connection with the idea so much, and I had to deal with that myself. The other thing I realized is that the advisors and mentors were locals; and they seemed pretty much interested in market-specific solutions instead more global or bolder ideas. While the actual program motivated us with big and bold cases of entrepreneurs, from the lectures, when it was about time to judge they seemed to be favoring things that were obviously market-driven in Brazil if not my region. I noticed that when some of the advisors loved my 3rd best idea which had to do with something to split bills of student groups drinking beer in pubs. 

That was weird, my weakest idea seemed to be the best. While my other, the yet another slides platform, wasn't see as hot. But, as you know, I wasn't so sure about that while in the arena. It was a kind of a soft guess that something were wrong. Of course because things were happening in a fast-paced approach. Mostly set in a hurry, and with some filter-first think later mentality, it seemed that the teams that had companies set - with more cofounders and more developed products/solutions, for the local market, were in fact moving with attention, or accelerated traction, from the program directors and mentors which where, to some extent, exercising validation. One other thing I didn't like was a characterization were the directors and mentors had a stake in the startups. In other words, anyone that passed the four weeks milestone were required to give 3% of their start-up which would be distributed to the advisors. So it felt, for a moment of suspicious, that they weren't in it for bold or weird ideas which I thought were the things of a global nature. To be fair, perhaps they would detect that if data were obvious. Anyway, I had that reflection going on at that moment so it could be a clear sign of a process of denial about my own and poor situation. 

Another thing I did't like was that some characterization of a show, like a TV show, seemed to happening. One day I pointed to the director, giving a lecture, a problem between the homework as told with the homework as given in the book materials, to which he quickly replied that "we are not in an university," and a lot of the participants - not to say students - laughed hard in the back of the room. I didn't get because that situation for me, of myself not able to bring a serious point, seemed to actually be a characterized setting of an university. Nevertheless I had a puzzle, or a prompt, or a páradox, and even started to consider how these interactions could have been misused not only by the founders but also by all the others involved, for example if we were too fast, or mechanized, sort of dancing in a show. Something seemed wrong.

#### Keeping on 


So I kept on walking, althought confused, but going. Is it the movement? Is it the program? Is it myself? So then it comes, having passed that point of denial, the moment of acceptance where learning starts. If this sounds like the phases of one experiencing a major loss, it's not a coincidence. Actually in fact this whole book is about that notion applied to the situation of entrepreneurship. For now, let us think that this foreword is a prelude to the requiem. Having entered a new learning zone, with the entrepreneurial lights yet on, I caught myself in front of the Blitzscaling lectures. This lectures became an inflection point which took me towards this book. I might have paid attention to Blitzscaling because of my connections with Silicon Valley, my love and hopes, for having worked there back in the days, and because I knew John Lilly who were one of the professors plus were the CEO when I worked for Mozilla about a decade before.  

I didn't know much about John but but can't forget something great he said once in a video. He were discussing a point about the future of Firefox with an UX specialist. The specialist made a point that the perfect tool consists of the actual problem solved; as in when the actual tool is not on the way of the problem. That was super coherent. But then John provoked a view where the development of tools - imperfect tools included - could take teams to make better tools. For me, that was profoundly coherent. The conversation was heated and video was taken from the web, although the thought was kept in my heart. Anyway I asked John Lilly to help me to get the subtitles because I wanted to translate them to portuguese. I got the subtitles in 2016, recruited a couple friends and started. Needless to say that when we are subtitling we are watching in slow motion. So we did the first, an interview with Brian Chesky, and the second with Nirav Tolia. These amazing lectures were changing my life. Now were these talks amazing because they were amazing or because I was engaged in slow motion? Yes, that is how it goes in real life. 

Which brings me to the 3rd talk. That one was unconventional, comparing to the others. This is when I heard of Michael Dearing, from Harrison Metal. And this is too when the subtitling project paused and where a new learning phase start, which later had characterized this book. As an aside, at this point I was clipping - and annotating - these and other video lectures with a tool which I named Fast Clip [^footnote_fastclip] and had hopes to make that a start-up. 

[^footnote_fastclip]: Here is a vide of myself presenting some of the ideas of the Fast Clip prototype https://youtu.be/DpZv9Jxk8ZY?si=wOwuqgulr0N2eU4I&t=132

These where days where I caught myself writing to Michael to say thanks many times. From Michael's materials, I met other great minds, like Barbara Minto, a light on my way. I wrote to Barbara to say thanks, had a chance to make a video call with her and she sent to me her book, *The Minto Pyramid Principle*, another turning or inflection point in my life. After watching some of his precious lectures, such as *Two Blasts From the Past*, *Executive Communications*, and his *General Managemnt 2 course about OKR*, Michael were becoming a conductor to what for me were enlightening views to the tracks I were laying. 

But back to the problem I had, which would be characterized as a dilemma, something was taking shape. Blitzscaling were giving me a viewpoint about the accelerated world (of startups) and the reflective characterizations of great leaders. As a lightning strike, I had found peace between the fast and slow world, where values and principles could actually be use to shock-absorb the fast-paced world, especially the fast-paced interactions in the start-up world. It was different, to see the Blitzscaling as a framework giving me the views to make scalable startups by offering a style of leadership very different from that local accelerator program. Of course, it is unfair to compare, starting with the fact that one were a practical program and the other mostly lectures organized with things in perspective. But anyway, and as an example, when I wrote a letter to that program director asking a word, pointing that I didn't like the task punishment they gave me, his answer were as simple as - just do it. On the other hand, although the Blitzscaling lectures were essentially about fast growth or startup growth, their reflections through the interviews carried the need for a reflective experience, carried values, and principles. How I were navigating my reflections about Blitzscaling seemed to be, although I didn't see at the time precisely, a quest to understand the self, the being, a quest to understand the characterizations of leaders that could actually do that sort of thing. 

By now, in terms of influences, I had two circles. One that actual practical program, the realities which I felt that were too fast and too confusing, a bit like a show and artificial. On the other hand, the Blitzscaling circle. But another circle had also influenced this work, the lean circle. Here is where the name Steve Blank appears. First, because Steve is the father of the lean startup movement, along with Eric Ries of course. Second, because the lean methods were exactly there, being used and activelly being used, in the arena. Now Steve is especially special here also because of his values. After having studied some of his talks, perhaps clipped or watching slowly, I could not avoid noticing his reflective mindset. I felt Steve's concerns about the actual use of lean, how lean methods were being used or misused, his views about the behaviors of founders when doing it. Moreover, he kept on as a learner, evolving by learning and also evolving his views. As an example, Steve cared to talk about a situation when founders engage in what he sees as being procrastinating with lean, when they claim to be using lean but aren't. Steve kept on engaged, and attentive, to when founders were lost, or less conscious. In terms of misuses of lean, or the complexity of using lean, Eric Ries had also understood a phenomenon, something where doers engage in ways in a way doing it while in many ways missing the view of purpose. Another plus, about Steve, was to see some of his views about the characterizations of founders in comparison with of artists.

#### The dilemma 


It was becoming clear, through the early studies and drafts before this book, the paradox, or the dilemma, between the produced echoes of Silicon Valley - by narratives, tools, methods, platforms, and accelerated networking systems - driven by need to reach outcomes, with the actual value system of top-tier leaders, not only entrepreneurs but the leaders of the grown-up organizations brought by Blitzscaling, and leading practitioners who cared about the misuses and behaviors. My attention was caught by that perpective, my start-up fading, and the book rising. In other words, through studying Blitzscaling, I started to sense that the people involved in the startups that had achieved success, seemed to be calmer, seemed to be people reading more, seemed to not follow one or other framework too strictly, seemed to be aware. On the other hand, the anxiety of entrepreneurs, seemed to set themselves to miss listening these voices. This is the gap I caught myself in and set myself to work and by this work I caught myself feeling the need to help others too. 


Now if you're characterized as a part entrepreneur or not fully qualified entrepreneur yet or not fully qualified investor, practitioner, but you are still involved in all this, we are all sharing the same entrepreneurial spirit or we share our interest with the entrepreneurial function, which is that we strive to change the world in our lives. We want to be in the equation, therefore we are aimed to recognize the complex of navigating this stormy sea.

But why a book geared towards entrepreneurs? First, because we are all entrepreneurs, even if we're just navigating our own lives. Second, entrepreneurs who strive to better the world are the ones genuinely in need to improve entrepreneurship itself. In other words, the impact of entrepreneurship feeds back into a more appropriate approach to both entrepreneurship and management. But, as it is evident from my motivations, the entrepreneur, or the true entrepreneurial characterization, can be living an attack endegered species. Third, according to Maslow (1998, p.232), entrepreneurs warrant attention because they play key roles in societies:

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)

Maslow's message set us to consider a perspective or a characterization of entrepreneurs which in fact may sometimes take us to see them apart. That they are generalists, or able to break from their specialists mindset. Now to see this as a characterization is important too not only because any of us will be called to be. But because in the face of our modern world we are being called to enter entrepreneurship in ways to be driven by the environment we may embrace a characterization of a generalist who happens to be mechanized in many ways. So I am here, in the face of our fast-paced nature, considering how our world full of bundled solutions now has a power to also bundle us, with its so many methods and tools and advises and narratives and voices where all is highly iterative through interactions. So I am here, asking us to be here, and asking us to unbundle the way that we are doing things. 

May this reflection be in your way, my hope is that you will see what is out there in different ways. You will be a more conscious entrepreneur, I hope. My hope is that our reflection will plant a seed in your path, on your course, one that will grow and spread through the culture of organization. This is not so because of any recipe, precise playbook given, but by the very moment that you took to join this as a conversation. For me, through this book reading moment, you have reflections from my learning experiences rooted in the work of individuals - such as managers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners - who inspired because they made a point about the necessity to be conscious, and for a conscious form of entrepreneurship. Thus, this book may carry on reflections but also stands as an accessible resource which calls for a conversation. 

I think that the intention of this book is not different from a perspective from "What Writers are Like," from "Becoming a Writer" by Dorothe Brande, where she had beautifully positioned her book outside the domain of craftsmanship: 

> *"There are some handbooks so valuable that no writer should be without them. .. This book is not even a companion volume to such works as those; it is a preliminary to them. If it is successful it will teach the beginner not how to write, but how to be a writer; and that is quite another thing."* Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)

Likewise, I feel that this book has no place among many play books that teaches how to execute a startup. But I do think that it works across the board, for all audiences interested in the entrepreneurial world and the startup ecosystem. Thus, it's for entrepreneurs which are beginners but for the grown up others that recognize that the true entrepreneur is always a learner, an apprentice.
