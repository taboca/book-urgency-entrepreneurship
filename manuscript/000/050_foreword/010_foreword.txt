Who is this author? Am I a qualified entrepreneur? I am certainly not a qualified practitioner, or an investor, or even a qualified software engineer which was the formal title I got when I moved to Silicon Valley. Now and wondering how that then-iconic company had hired an unqualified software engineer that could not speak proper English it comes to my mind another facet - of my unqualified artist. But I share something with all of these characters. I'm sympathetic to their causes, to their movement. When wearing my founder helmet, which I did many times, I had seen a promising ground, like a salt lake flat. I had put gas in the tank, an energy to accelerate, an invitation to run. And I hacked my own motorcycle, forged its pistons by hand, and polished its tires, unqualified. Having crossed an ocean and arrived there, I wanted to be timed, or validated, perhaps to break the world’s record. But too, I know, I was there to run, to accelerate. This is so because, as we know, founders aren't different from sport professionals and real artists. They want to break records, true. But they are in it for the love of being part too. I share these values.

Now, you may ask, why we are here? You and I. Why are you and I am here? For now, I ask us to look at our space and to see a rain on our way. I know, that we look for love, that we have no time for tears. But that might be exactly a good reason to consider our building blocks - given by tools and methods and social mechanisms - to consider that richer, faster, and accelerated networked environment which wants to give us that ride. I ask us to see us, ride takers, from perspective, like that music clip where we are waiving to them, eager to pick a ride. From here, looking at myself there impressed by their shining machines, I can easily say that that don't impress me much. But we know how it goes, in real life, in the arena, when we are using yhat hungry founder helmet, how do. And they do because most of them seem pretty smart, or pretty right - some of them are geniuses. But then, again and again, they can drive us up to a wall. What are them building blocks? They are the potential customers, potential mentors, potential advisors, potential practitioners, potential investors, potential marketeers, incubators, accelerators, you name it. And with their bright and qualified tools and methods or frameworks or platforms, they want to ride with us, to give us what they have, to give us that ride.

But can we blame all that? Well, it's tough. Because we know that althouth through turbulence and chaos these building blocks are passive, not aggressive. We know that is up to us to use these bricks, when we need, as we need. That is what we do, in that arena, it is how we get our credits, our grades. All in all, we know, they are just another brick. And they are there for us to build. From the fair side, we know of that, and it goes well with the optimistic view from Marc Andreesseen - the founding partner of A16Z, the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley - of a raise in quality of life: 

> *"We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life."*  (Andreessen, M., A16z, 2023)

#### In the arena 

That can't be missed, indeed. Because indeed it looks like a supermarket, a big one, hyperconnected, networked, abundant, and cheap. When I put on my founder helmet, and take the cart, there I go again, optimistic. I feel a raise in entrepreneurial action, I run throught the aisle, aisles for all our startup needs. There we can find solutions for everything, qualified and coherent, for every single job step [^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap] of the startup's job to be done, setting us to be literally equipped, literally augmented, literally into the process. 

[^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap]: In the article "Mapping the Job-to-be-Done" (Ulwick, 2017), Tony Ulwick defines job map as an "ideal process flow" that customers go through as they are involved in a job to be done. The steps are: Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude. The main point of the job map is to help the deconstruction of a job that customers are trying to get done, thus with the understanding of customer needs, before considering the opportunities in terms of products or solutions. With that said, I have drawn an analogy from this concept - due to its underlying universality - to provoke us to consider that if the very job of the entrepreneurial is yet another job to be done and conversely many solutions exists: methods, tools, platforms, and more. 

That is that, from the good side, we have seen it, we can run. From the bad side, it may take our attention. But we, entrepreneurs, aren't machines. We are the doers and we get this credit because, as we know, we are the ones in the arena. So if the ecosystem gives us the opportunity and at the same time can be a trap, that is yet another reason for us to wear the helmet of entrepreneurs and to be in the position of doers that are also learners, to be learning in the arena, from the arena. 



Now, what we know in the arena of founders is that we can't blame the ecosystem or that supermarket. And we know because that's part of entrepreneurial entrepreneurship is that we are in the arena to deal with those things. So we know that there is a good side or a bright side and also an overwhelming side up to the point when we think of it as an evil side. But that's really how it goes in the real life of founders. It is part of the challenge, that we deal with the external environment, the ladder, and the building blocks, and that we have to be responsible, able to identify signal from noise, to put on the helmet on and off, to think through. We know that and we know that that is how we get the credit, for being in the arena. That we have to learn from doing, we know, and we know too that trial and error is faster, or cheaper, which challenge us to learn faster too. And because things can be overwhelming, it's also weird when we pause, when we take that helmet off. We never know, how philosophical, how deep, we can go. It feels that we are paralyzed, to think of even a brief moment of analysis, especially when we see so many other doers or runners passing by, with their helmets, somewhat protected, faster and faster.

@outline - in and out 
--> 


To consider the explosion of accelerators throughout the world, I will tell you of one of my experiences from around 2016, when I had joined a Silicon Valley-based accelerator program that came to my city in Brazil. My application started with a quick background check about the program' reputation. It passed my initial criteria, I may have used 15 minutes plus watched an inspiring lecture which they gave. I also noticed that the accelerator CEO seemed to be well-connected. Plus, they had a well-known startup in their account. With all things coherent going on I did a check with their educational materials. Check there, I found quality stuff in terms of theories, and narrative was sound and seemed to go along with methods and theories which were actively being used by founders and carried over by other and known top-tier Silicon Valley narratives. 

So then I had engaged and also did some tests, plus they saw my resume and I was lucky to get one of two scholarships among the class and not pay the tuition fee. So I were all set and excited, somehow characterized by them as a technical aspiring founder, because of my background in computer science from almost 2 decades ago, and entered the program feeling energetic. That lasted for three weeks, so I became a dropout. That came about because the program gave me a penalty, a task, which was a chance for me to course-correct what I have done. I couldn't really figure why why that task but it had to do with a bad grade from a pitch event plus something from my behaviors. But the actual reason I left were, initially anyway, due to the homework which they gave it to me which I didn't like. Now, as we know, usually, many of our reflections happens in a post-mortem fashion. The first things I did was to be mad, and to blame the problem. Later I engaged in reflections, trying to understand. Perhaps I did a bargain, allowed a movement into what can be a rabbit role.

@outline - living the denial 
--> 




Anyway as part of the process of denial or being made, one think it was very clear which was obviously tied to the situation that had happened - why my pitch wasn't good? I noted that program required me to think of three different ideas, to pitch them and get feedback, and to refine. The other thing I realized is that the advisors and mentors were locals; and they seemed pretty much interested in market-specific solutions instead more global or bolder ideas. While the actual program motivated us with big and bold cases of entrepreneurs, from the lectures, when it was about time to judge they seemed to be favoring things that were obviously market-driven in Brazil if not my region. I noticed that when some of the advisors loved my 3rd best idea which had to do with something to split bills of student groups drinking beer in pubs. 

That was weird, my weakest idea (to my eyes which by the way were the one I had less connection with) seemed to be the best. While my other, which I had referred as "yet another slides platform," wasn't hot to their eyes, only for me. It seemed that the teams that had more cofounders and more developed products/solutions, in a way or another tied to the local market, were in fact moving with better attention. But, as you may guess, I wasn't so sure about that. I was mainly there, in the arena, coming up with some soft guesses and being in a space of frustration. It took me a couple years to actually figure more about some of the potential characterizations of accelerator programs. The thought I came across, which I referred to it as "filter-first think later" [^footnote_accelerators] mentality. I came across a research paper in 2019, entitled *How do accelerators select startups? Shifting decision criteria across stages* (Yin & Luo, 2018), which gave me a bit of clarity about my conspiration theory that some accelerators were selecting by market first, and other characterizations of what appeared to be professional teams. Back to the days, I also didn't like that directors and mentors had a stake from the startup pie - from the 3% given to the program. So I felt, under that moment of suspicious, that they weren't in it for bold or weird ideas which I thought were the things of a global nature. To be fair, from the accelerator point of view, that other perhaps they would detect that if data were obvious. Anyway, I had that reflection going on at that moment so it could be a clear sign of a process of denial about my own and poor situation.

Another thing I did't like was that some characterization of a show, like a TV show, seemed to happening. One day I pointed to the director, giving a lecture, a problem between the homework as told with the homework as given in the book materials, to which he quickly replied that "we are not in an university," and a lot of the participants - not to say students - laughed hard in the back of the room. I didn't get because that situation for me, of myself not able to bring a serious point, seemed to actually be a characterized setting of an university. Nevertheless I had a puzzle, or a prompt, or a páradox, and even started to consider how these interactions could have been misused not only by the founders but also by all the others involved, for example if we were too fast, or mechanized, sort of dancing in a show. Something seemed wrong.

#### Keeping on 


So I kept on walking, althought confused, but going. Is it the movement? Is it the program? Is it myself? So then it comes, having passed that point of denial, the moment of acceptance where learning starts. If this sounds like the phases of one experiencing a major loss, it's not a coincidence. Maybe this whole book is about that thing applied to the situation of entrepreneurship. For now, let us think that this foreword is a prelude to the requiem. Having entered a new learning zone, with the entrepreneurial lights yet on, I caught myself in front of the Blitzscaling lectures. This lectures became an inflection point which took me towards this book. I might have paid attention to Blitzscaling because of my connections with Silicon Valley, my love and hopes, for having worked there back in the days, and because I knew John Lilly who were one of the professors plus were the CEO when I worked for Mozilla about a decade before.  

I didn't know much about John but but can't forget something great he said once in a video. He were discussing a point about the future of Firefox with an UX specialist. The specialist made a point that the perfect tool consists of the actual problem solved; as in when the actual tool is not on the way of the problem. That was super coherent. But then John provoked a view where the development of tools - imperfect tools included - could take teams to make better tools. For me, that was profoundly coherent. The conversation was heated and video was taken from the web, although the thought was kept in my heart. Anyway I asked John Lilly to help me to get the subtitles because I wanted to translate them to portuguese. I got the subtitles in 2016, recruited a couple friends and started. Needless to say that when we are subtitling we are watching in slow motion. So we did the first, an interview with Brian Chesky, and the second with Nirav Tolia. These amazing lectures were changing my life. Now were these talks amazing because they were amazing or because I was engaged in slow motion? Yes, that is how it goes in real life. 

Which brings me to the 3rd talk. That one was unconventional, comparing to the others. This is when I heard of Michael Dearing, from Harrison Metal. And this is too when the subtitling project paused and where a new learning phase start, which later had characterized this book. As an aside, at this point I was clipping - and annotating - these and other video lectures with a tool which I named Fast Clip [^footnote_fastclip] and had hopes to make that a start-up. 

[^footnote_fastclip]: Here is a vide of myself presenting some of the ideas of the Fast Clip prototype https://youtu.be/DpZv9Jxk8ZY?si=wOwuqgulr0N2eU4I&t=132

These where days where I caught myself writing to Michael to say thanks many times. From Michael's materials, I met other great minds, like Barbara Minto, a light on my way. I wrote to Barbara to say thanks, had a chance to make a video call with her and she sent to me her book, *The Minto Pyramid Principle*, another turning or inflection point in my life. After watching some of his precious lectures, such as *Two Blasts From the Past*, *Executive Communications*, and his *General Managemnt 2 course about OKR*, Michael were becoming a conductor to what for me were enlightening views to the tracks I were laying. 

But back to the problem I had, which would be characterized as a dilemma, something was taking shape. Blitzscaling were giving me a viewpoint about the accelerated world (of startups) and the reflective characterizations of great leaders. As a lightning strike, I had found peace between the fast and slow world, where values and principles could actually be use to shock-absorb the fast-paced world, especially the fast-paced interactions in the start-up world. It was different, to see the Blitzscaling as a framework giving me the views to make scalable startups by offering a style of leadership very different from that local accelerator program. Of course, it is unfair to compare, starting with the fact that one were a practical program and the other mostly lectures organized with things in perspective. But anyway, and as an example, when I wrote a letter to that program director asking a word, pointing that I didn't like the task punishment they gave me, his answer were as simple as - just do it. On the other hand, although the Blitzscaling lectures were essentially about fast growth or startup growth, their reflections through the interviews carried the need for a reflective experience, carried values, and principles. How I were navigating my reflections about Blitzscaling seemed to be, although I didn't see at the time precisely, a quest to understand the self, the being, a quest to understand the characterizations of leaders that could actually do that sort of thing. 

By now, in terms of influences, I had two circles. One that actual practical program, the realities which I felt that were too fast and too confusing, a bit like a show and artificial. On the other hand, the Blitzscaling circle. But another circle had also influenced this work, the lean circle. Here is where the name Steve Blank appears. First, because Steve is the father of the lean startup movement, along with Eric Ries of course. Second, because the lean methods were exactly there, being used and activelly being used, in the arena. Now Steve is especially special here also because of his values. After having studied some of his talks, perhaps clipped or watching slowly, I could not avoid noticing his reflective mindset. I felt Steve's concerns about the actual use of lean, how lean methods were being used or misused, his views about the behaviors of founders when doing it. Moreover, he kept on as a learner, evolving by learning and also evolving his views. As an example, Steve cared to talk about a situation when founders engage in what he sees as being procrastinating with lean, when they claim to be using lean but aren't. Steve kept on engaged, and attentive, to when founders were lost, or less conscious. In terms of misuses of lean, or the complexity of using lean, Eric Ries had also understood a phenomenon, something where doers engage in ways in a way doing it while in many ways missing the view of purpose. Another plus, about Steve, was to see some of his views about the characterizations of founders in comparison with of artists.

#### The dilemma 


It was becoming clear, through the early studies and drafts before this book, the paradox, or the dilemma, between the produced echoes of Silicon Valley - by narratives, tools, methods, platforms, and accelerated networking systems - driven by need to reach outcomes, with the actual value system of top-tier leaders, not only entrepreneurs but the leaders of the grown-up organizations brought by Blitzscaling, and leading practitioners who cared about the misuses and behaviors. My attention was caught by that perpective, my start-up fading, and the book rising. In other words, through studying Blitzscaling, I started to sense that the people involved in the startups that had achieved success, seemed to be calmer, seemed to be people reading more, seemed to not follow one or other framework too strictly, seemed to be aware. On the other hand, the anxiety of entrepreneurs, seemed to set themselves to miss listening these voices. This is the gap I caught myself in and set myself to work and by this work I caught myself feeling the need to help others too. 


Now if you're characterized as a part entrepreneur or not fully qualified entrepreneur yet or not fully qualified investor, practitioner, but you are still involved in all this, we are all sharing the same entrepreneurial spirit or we share our interest with the entrepreneurial function, which is that we strive to change the world in our lives. We want to be in the equation, therefore we are aimed to recognize the complex of navigating this stormy sea.

But why a book geared towards entrepreneurs? First, because we are all entrepreneurs, even if we're just navigating our own lives. Second, entrepreneurs who strive to better the world are the ones genuinely in need to improve entrepreneurship itself. In other words, the impact of entrepreneurship feeds back into a more appropriate approach to both entrepreneurship and management. But, as it is evident from my motivations, the entrepreneur, or the true entrepreneurial characterization, can be living an attack endegered species. Third, according to Maslow (1998, p.232), entrepreneurs warrant attention because they play key roles in societies:

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)

Maslow's message set us to consider a perspective or a characterization of entrepreneurs which in fact may sometimes take us to see them apart. That they are generalists, or able to break from their specialists mindset. Now to see this as a characterization is important too not only because any of us will be called to be. But because in the face of our modern world we are being called to enter entrepreneurship in ways to be driven by the environment we may embrace a characterization of a generalist who happens to be mechanized in many ways. So I am here, in the face of our fast-paced nature, considering how our world full of bundled solutions now has a power to also bundle us, with its so many methods and tools and advises and narratives and voices where all is highly iterative through interactions. So I am here, asking us to be here, and asking us to unbundle the way that we are doing things. 

May this reflection be in your way, my hope is that you will see what is out there in different ways. You will be a more conscious entrepreneur, I hope. My hope is that our reflection will plant a seed in your path, on your course, one that will grow and spread through the culture of organization. This is not so because of any recipe, precise playbook given, but by the very moment that you took to join this as a conversation. For me, through this book reading moment, you have reflections from my learning experiences rooted in the work of individuals - such as managers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners - who inspired because they made a point about the necessity to be conscious, and for a conscious form of entrepreneurship. Thus, this book may carry on reflections but also stands as an accessible resource which calls for a conversation. 

I think that the intention of this book is not different from a perspective from "What Writers are Like," from "Becoming a Writer" by Dorothe Brande, where she had beautifully positioned her book outside the domain of craftsmanship: 

> *"There are some handbooks so valuable that no writer should be without them. .. This book is not even a companion volume to such works as those; it is a preliminary to them. If it is successful it will teach the beginner not how to write, but how to be a writer; and that is quite another thing."* Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)

Likewise, I feel that this book has no place among many play books that teaches how to execute a startup. But I do think that it works across the board, for all audiences interested in the entrepreneurial world and the startup ecosystem. Thus, it's for entrepreneurs which are beginners but for the grown up others that recognize that the true entrepreneur is always a learner, an apprentice.
