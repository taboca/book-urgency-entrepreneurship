Who is this author? I'm not a qualified entrepreneur. I'm also not a qualified practitioner, or an investor, or even a qualified software engineer which was the formal title I got when I moved to Silicon Valley. Now and wondering how that iconic company [*] had hired an unqualified software engineer that could not speak English, it comes to my mind another facet - of the unqualified artist. But I share something with all of these characters - that I'm sympathetic to their causes, to their movement. When wearing my founder helmet, which I did many times, I had seen a promising ground, like a salt lake flat. I had put gas in the tank, an energy to accelerate, an invitation to run. And I hacked my own motorcycle, forged its pistons by hand, and polished its tires, unqualified. Having arrived there, I wanted to be timed, or validated, perhaps break the world’s record. But too, I knew, I wanted to run, to be there, to accelerate. Founders are not different from qualified sport professionals or qualified artists. They want to break the record, perhaps put a dent in the universe; But they also love to be part of the movement. 

Our environment - of tools, methods, and the social mechanisms - given by this now networked and digital world, sometimes looks like that salt lake flat. They invite us to join and to accelerate. And we know, of the so many things in front of us, an abundant world of solutions, with voices, narratives, tools, methods, platforms, and networks - all which give us a means for interacting and iterating. While it can be overwhelming, we don't see all of that as a flat land meant to slow us down. In reality, what we see, and what we get, are things to boost us, to take us to move even faster. Consider, for example, the cost to access motivation from these networks. We can be thrilled with stories that enlighten our entrepreneurial spirit. On the other hand, consider the tools, or methods, that are proven to advance collaboration. But more than motivation and processes, we are equally able to advance the actual startup using actual networks of support, the interactive spaces where we can get in touch with potential customers, investors, mentors, practitioners, cofounders, partners, and more. 

In this world, there are far many solutions to help us throughout all the process steps [^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap] of the entrepreneurial effort. In other words, the modern entrepreneur is well equipped - if not in a hypermarket of offerings - with solutions to help them from definition into execution and up to conclusion. No way all that there is can or should be thought, as a bad ground for founders and their start ups. Even if their starting journey looks a bit like a desert and quite a lonely place, as soon as they set foot they get to be literally equipped, literally augmented, and literally into a process - which sets them into what it feels to be state of readiness,  feeling energetic and being empowered, and ready to action. 

[^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap]: In the article "Mapping the Job-to-be-Done" (Ulwick, 2017), Tony Ulwick defines job map as an "ideal process flow" that customers go through as they are involved in a job to be done. The steps are: Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude. The main point of the job map is to help the deconstruction of a job that customers are trying to get done, thus with the understanding of customer needs, before considering the opportunities in terms of products or solutions. With that said, I have drawn an analogy from this concept - due to its underlying universality - to provoke us to consider that if the very job of the entrepreneurial is yet another job to be done and conversely many solutions exists: methods, tools, platforms, and more.

How could we blame abundance, right? Since there is always the right moment and time where each solution fits a need. Yes, there is turbulence, and chaos. But in no way can these building blocks break our optimistic view. This is so because we are in the arena, it’s part of our calling, to break from noise and record the signals. This is how we get the credit. A perspective can be seen if we zoom out. Consider the optimistic view from Marc Andreesseen, the general partner of A16Z the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley, for where we are and what we have built:  

> *"We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life."*  (Andreessen, M., A16z, 2023)

Marc's note makes me see our world as a hypermarket, abundant, almost infinite, colorful, expensive and cheap, for when I wear my consumer hat. But it took me to consider another market, one that I see when I put on my founder helmet. And again, it's positive. Being there, I feel empowered with a raise, a raise in entrepreneurial power. When I enter it, I feel empowered when I run throught its aisles - of tools, methodologies, platforms, networks, and the crowds, and more. All that is given sounds like a given, and it is applicable to a given time, I know. And all through its shelves are, to some or more extent, fully qualified. 





#### In the arena 

<!-- 
@outline - Should we worry? My case. 
--> 


So all of that impact us anyway. From the good side, we have seen, we can run. From the bad side, it may take our attention. And that may be so much that if we pause too watch and see what is there, we may feel paralized in comparisong with us runners. These extremmes would be the case if we could not reason, just jump as if the world if binary. But we, entrepreneurs, aren't machines. We are the doers and we get this credit because, as we know, we are the ones in the arena. So if the ecosystem gives us the opportunity and at the same time can be a trap, that is yet another reason for us to wear the helmet of entrepreneurs and to be in the position of doers that are also learners, to be learning in the arena, from the arena. 

To consider the explosion of accelerators throughout the world, I will tell you of one of my experiences from around 2016, when I had joined a Silicon Valley-based accelerator program that came to my city in Brazil. My application started with a quick background check about the program' reputation. It passed my initial criteria, I may have used 15 minutes plus watched an inspiring lecture which they gave. I also noticed that the accelerator CEO seemed to be well-connected. Plus, they had a well-known startup in their account. With all things coherent going on I did a check with their educational materials. Check there, I found quality stuff in terms of theories, and narrative was sound and seemed to go along with methods and theories which were actively being used by founders and carried over by other and known top-tier Silicon Valley narratives. So I did their initial tests, got a scholarship, and I were in. Having entered the program I caught myself, three weeks after, out of it. 

That came about because the program gave me a penalty, a task, which was a chance for me to course-correct what I have done. I couldn't really figure why that task but it had to do with a bad grade I got from a pitch plus something from my behavior. But the actual reason I left were, initially anyway, due to the homework which they gave it to me which I didn't like. 

Now, as we know, usually, many of our reflections happens in a post-mortem fashion. The first things I did was to be mad, and to blame the problem. First, I noted that program required me to think of three different ideas, to pitch them and get feedback, and to refine. That was weird for me because I suspected that the variability of the ideas and its totally different markets would actually create a sort of complication for myself in terms of values, a potential disconnect of my interest, in case the one receiving best feedback were the one I didn't have the best connection with. In a way, it seemed that the program didn't care about my connection with the idea so much, and I had to deal with that myself. The other thing I realized is that the advisors and mentors were locals; and they seemed pretty much interested in market-specific solutions instead more global or bolder ideas. While the actual program motivated us with big and bold cases of entrepreneurs, from the lectures, when it was about time to judge they seemed to be favoring things that were obviously market-driven in Brazil if not my region. I noticed that when some of the advisors loved my 3rd best idea which had to do with something to split bills of student groups drinking beer in pubs. Yet, I wasn't so sure. It was a kind of a soft guess that something were wrong. Other point is that things were happening in a fast-paced approach - which seemed to not be a problem if not was an actual high-beat mood part of doing things - so the actual potential for digging, as in to wonder, or to have conversations, these sort of dynamics, seemed to be artificial, or superficial. Mostly set in a hurry, and with some filter-first think later mentality, it seemed that the teams that had companies set - with more cofounders and more developed products and solutions for the local market - were moving with better attention of the directors and the mentors through their validating moments. One other characterization were that the directors and mentors had a stake in the startups according to the agreements. In other words, anyone that passed the four weeks time frame would actually be required to give about 3% to the program. So it felt for a moment that they weren't in it for really bold ideas, or things of a global nature. To be fair, perhaps they would detect that if data was obvious. Anyway I had that reflection going on, so clearly a denial of my own poor situation. 

Another thing I did't like was that some characterization of a show, like a TV show, seemed to happening. One day I pointed to the director, giving a lecture, a problem between the homework as told with the homework as given in the book materials, to which he quickly replied that "we are not in an university," and a lot of the participants - not to say students - laughed hard in the back of the room. I didn't get because that situation for me, of myself not able to bring a serious point, seemed to actually be a characterized setting of an university. Nevertheless I had a puzzle, or a prompt, or a páradox, and even started to consider how these interactions could have been misused not only by the founders but also by all the others involved, for example if we were too fast, or mechanized, sort of dancing in a show. Something seemed wrong.

#### Keeping on 


But I kept on, a bit confused but going. Is it the whole movement? Is it that program? Is it myself? And of course it comes, from that point of a denial of your own movement, another learning process, about the self at certain point; which sounds like phases of one experiencing a major loss. So perhaps I were there, having failed miserably, in front of consiering the assumptions about what I were doing. That is when I had entered a new learning zone, since my interest about entrepreneurial action, and entrepreneurship in general, was yet alive in me and I didn't decide to go back to work for a grown-up company. Coincidentally at that time I caught myself in front of the Blitzscaling lectures which became an inflection point taking my attention towards the actual new perspectives and values which took me towards this book eventually. Maybe I paid attention to Blitzscaling too because of my connections with Silicon Valley, for having worked there back in the days, or because of John Lilly who where the CEO of Mozilla when I were an FTE from Brazil. 

Now I didn't know much about John - besides the fact that he were the CEO of Mozilla at the time - but I remembered a great point I heard from him from a heated conversation in an video which was taken out from the web. He were discussing a point about the future of Firefox with an UX expert from Mozilla. And the UX professional said that the perfect tool would consist of the actual problem, or need, solved; as in when the tool is not needed or almost transparent. But John gave a view that I loved. He made his point, that through the development of tools - imperfect tools included - through using it, through collaboration, through conversations, teams could understand the problem and arrive at better tools. I had understood how they both were talking about the same thing. But I loved the angle from John. The video was taken from the web but kept in my heart. So I asked John Lilly to connect me with the subtitles of the Blitzscalinng lectures because I wanted to help to produce, translate, to bring the pt-br ones to help Brazil. So I got the subtitles and recruited a couple friends to help and we did about two of them, Brian and Nirav, amazing lectures, a change to my life, perhaps due to the slow subtitling experience. 

But then, the 3rd I picked were a talk from this person named Michael Dearing. That is when the subtitling project paused. It's on hold up to now, although now we have the book. So I caught myself in front of Michael Dearing talk, stuck, which brings us to Michael Dearing. Michael Dearing, a known Silicon Valley angel investor and professor of management and entrepreneurship brought up his educational system which gave me a new perspective through the works which led me to characterize the book and more precisely some of my current views. This were forming quite slow through the moments which I thought I was making a start-up, named Fast Clip [^footnote_fastclip]. (A side note about Fast Clip: I heard Reid Hoffman saying the word 'fast clip'. So I used that as a name for an idea of a tool which allowed me to clip the Blitzscaling video talks. In other words, the idea consisted of enabling a community of people to study/have conversations about various precious moments from these special videos which happen to have low views but were great. In other words, by clipping, I hoped to bring about good conversations from user collaboration to elevate attention and reflective thinking.) 

[^footnote_fastclip]: Here is a vide of myself presenting some of the ideas of the Fast Clip prototype https://youtu.be/DpZv9Jxk8ZY?si=wOwuqgulr0N2eU4I&t=132

Where I making a start-up or a science project - as Michael would say - or studying and trying to figure something and also struggling with my own struggles as an entrepreneur? This connection with Michael brought me to write to him on various occasions, nevertheless inspired and engaged, which brought me to other great minds like Barbara Minto. I wrote to Barbara too and even had a video call with her, plus she sent to me her book, The Minto Pyramid Principle which was a turning point in my life. Back to Michael, some two or three precious lectures/reflections from Michael were his *Two Blasts From the Past* and the *Executive Communications* and his GM2 course about OKR. Thoughts in alignment with what I think are thoughts from Michael are all over this book, aside from the specific points where Michael appears as a conductor. 

But back to the problem, or the dilemma I had, and through the Blitzscaling, something I was taking, as in answers about that fast mode and the slow mode, about a value-system which perhaps that other program were lacking. When doing the program, it seemed that the leaders and advisor-directors were quite oriented to the actual key results they needed. Oh well, that makes sense right? as it was a practical program. For example, when I wrote a letter to a director asking a word, pointing that I didn't like the task punishment they gave me, the penalty they gave me, and I wanted to talk about that, his answer were as simple as - just do it. That short. No talks, no comments, no considerations. On the other hand, although the Blitzscaling lectures were essentially about fast growth or startup growth, their reflections through the interviews carried something totally different. Blitzscaling showed a reflective experience, with values, with principles. How I were navigating my reflections about Blitzscaling seemed to be, although I didn't see at the time precisely, a quest to understand the self, the being, a quest to understand the characterizations of leaders that could actually do that sort of thing. 

Now, if we go back to other characterizations of the richer geneneral ecosystem, and lean movements were all around, i have to mention Steve Blank. This is so because Steve is a father of the lean startup movement, along with Eric Ries of course, and also because the lean methods were exactly there, in the middle. I mean, perhaps the problem space I were looking, in terms of concentric circles, could be characterized as the accelator closer to you, the lean circle, and the Blitzscaling circle. When editing this section, I did a search across this book work's repository and found 161 results with the term "Steve Blank". A first point to bring Steve, besides his role as a father of the Lean Startup movement, goes back to that sort of characterization and values. After having studied some of his materials, I also observed something in him, also through the videos and interviews, his reflective mindset. I always felt that Steve were concerned about the actual use of lean, how lean methods were using used and misused, as in the behavioral patterns of founders when doing it. As an example his observation about founders procrastinating with lean. In other words, Steve is aware of how founders misuse these methods and he kept going on, quite engaged and attentive, to when founders were lost, or less conscious, or as Eric Ries would put it to lack the view of purpose. Plus, a big plus, Steve had reflected about the role of the founders vs. artists.  





#### The dilemma 


<!-- 
@outline - Back to complication 
--> 

It was becoming clear, through the early studies and drafts before this book, the paradox, or the dilemma, between the produced echoes of Silicon Valley - by narratives, tools, methods, platforms, and accelerated networking systems - driven by need to reach outcomes, with the actual value system of top-tier leaders, not only entrepreneurs but the leaders of the grown-up organizations brought by Blitzscaling, and leading practitioners who cared about the misuses and behaviors. My attention was caught by that perpective, my start-up fading, and the book rising. In other words, through studying Blitzscaling, I started to sense that the people involved in the startups that had achieved success, seemed to be calmer, seemed to be people reading much more, seemed to not follow one or other framework too strictly, seemed to be aware. On the other hand, the anxiety of entrepreneurs, seemed to set themselves to miss listening these voices. This is the gap I caught myself in and set myself to work and by this work I caught myself feeling the need to help others too. 


<!-- 
@outline - real complication 
Contextualize here some nuances of the rational rationality. 
-->

We, as entrepreneurs, who strive to change the world and our lives, recognize the complexities of navigating a stormy sea. But like any environment that needs to change, we don't have time to adjust our routine. We are bound to the pace of acceleration, to the urgent drumbeat, the pressure for decision. We are pushed to decide, to move forward. 

Consider, for example, how we are bombarded by a torrent of information, we are immersed in constant overexposure that submerges us in a sea of choices. The channels we subscribe, the "newspapers" we read, and the systems and networks that shape behaviors; with data, with what we think as "good reasons," empowering us to the next step. In this environment, entrepreneurs might see themselves as protagonists, empowered to execute faster with a feeling of certainty to an iminent success.

But why a book geared towards entrepreneurs? First, because we are all entrepreneurs, even if we're just navigating our own lives. Second, entrepreneurs who strive to better the world are the ones genuinely in need to improve entrepreneurship itself. In other words, the impact of entrepreneurship feeds back into a more appropriate approach to both entrepreneurship and management. But, as it is evident from my motivations, the entrepreneur, or the true entrepreneurial characterization, can be living an attack endegered species. Third, according to Maslow (1998, p.232), entrepreneurs warrant attention because they play key roles in societies:

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)

Maslow's message reinforces a perspective of an entrepreneur as a role that transcends other specialists roles and in fact can support anyone. In this regard, support for the entrepreneurial role is support for a reflective moment as an opportunity to  understanding of navigation, organization, productivity, and conscious entrepreneurship. For entrepreneurs, interested in being around, for their lasting business or as professionals. A call for slowing down has more to do with the needs reflective character that respects the self, and respect the new cycles too. 

The consideration here is that the generalist role which is a must from the entrepreneur might be in part mechanized. I have considered that, with the many resources that were light to my perosnal path, brought me to see the bundled situation, the fworld; and a need for us to move our entrepreneurship with a willingness to unbundle things, such as the pathways of entrepreneurship. 

May this reflection be in your way, my hope is that you will see what is out there in different ways. You will be a more conscious entrepreneur, I hope. My hope is that our reflection will plant a seed in your path, on your course, one that will grow and spread through the culture of organization. This is not so because of any recipe, precise playbook given, but by the very moment that you took to join this as a conversation. For me, through this book reading moment, you have reflections from my learning experiences rooted in the work of individuals - such as managers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners - who inspired because they made a point about the necessity to be conscious, and for a conscious form of entrepreneurship. Thus, this book may carry on reflections but also stands as an accessible resource which calls for a conversation. 

I think that the intention of this book is not different from a perspective from "What Writers are Like," from "Becoming a Writer" by Dorothe Brande, where she had beautifully positioned her book outside the domain of craftsmanship: 

> *"There are some handbooks so valuable that no writer should be without them. .. This book is not even a companion volume to such works as those; it is a preliminary to them. If it is successful it will teach the beginner not how to write, but how to be a writer; and that is quite another thing."* Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)

Likewise, I feel that this book has no place among many play books that teaches how to execute a startup. But I do think that it works across the board, for all audiences interested in the entrepreneurial world and the startup ecosystem. Thus, it's for entrepreneurs which are beginners but for the grown up others that recognize that the true entrepreneur is always a learner, an apprentice.
