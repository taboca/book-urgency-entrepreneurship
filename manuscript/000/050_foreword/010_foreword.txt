Who is this author? Am I a qualified entrepreneur? I am certainly not a qualified practitioner, or an investor, or even a qualified software engineer which was the formal title I got when I moved to Silicon Valley. When I wondering why that iconic [^footnote_netscape] company had hired an unqualified software engineer that could not speak proper English it comes to my mind the facet of my unqualified artist. But I share something with entrepreneurs and many of these characters who are generally interested in helping them. I'm sympathetic to the cause. When I wear my founder helmet, which I did many times, I had seen a promising ground, like a salt lake flat. I had put gas in the tank, focused my energy to accelerate. I hacked my own motorcycle, forged its pistons by hand, and polished its unqualified tires. Like many others, I haved crossed an ocean, in terms of time anyway. Once there, I wanted to be timed, in startup terms validated, perhaps to break the world's record. But like other founders who aren't different from sport professionals and true artists, I was in for the ride. This is who I am.

[^footnote_netscape]: Background note - I were invited to work for the then-iconic company known as Netscape after a longer period of attempts, having arrived around 2000 with the official tittle were software engineer although I hired to be technology evangelist to help Netscape's marketing.

But between us, just the two of us, there is a conversation that shouldn't take too long; especially the who among us that are in for love, that don't have time for tears, and want to make it. Furthermore, when we are certain that we can make it if we try. It's about the road ahead and how we see that road as one that matters. I invite you to take a seat, take a deep breath, and picture a founder, you or a founder you care. She is now inside that screen, in the video clip, on a desert with her luggage. And she is eager to take that ride, the real ride, so she waves her thumbs up to the passers. Many of them are coming, all interested, all offering that ride. With their shiny machines they seem pretty smart, pretty right, some even think they are geniuses. Now, from your safer seat, we can get things, how that don't impress us much. But from the arena, we can see, how she struggles by the impressions they cause. And how they drive her up the wall. Who are they? They are the folks carring on the building blocks, qualified tools and methods. They are the potential mentors, potential advisors, potential practitioners, potential investors, potential marketeers, incubators, accelerators, you name it. They are all interested and eager to give her that ride.

Can we, or should we blame what we have? Well, it's tough, we know. Because while it appears to be chaotic, they are quite passive, not aggressive. All in all, we know, they are just another brick. From far, it is fair to consider the perpective, the optimistic one, from Marc Andreesseen, the founding partner of A16Z, the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley. Marc reminds us that abundance does not mean aggressiveness:  

> *"We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life."*  (Andreessen, M., A16z, 2023)

If not by induction, by simply looking around to the environment of the modern founder we will see a supermarket, one that is abundant and cheap. And when I put my hands on that cart, especially if I'm hungry and optimistic, I can feel that raise, a raise in entrepreneurial action. That takes me through the aisles, to run. What is new now is that there are aisles for all our startup needs, for all the job steps [^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap] of the startup's job to be done. We feel literally equipped, literally augmented, literally empowered, literally into the process. 

[^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap]: In the article "Mapping the Job-to-be-Done" (Ulwick, 2017), Tony Ulwick defines job map as an "ideal process flow" that customers go through as they are involved in a job to be done. The steps are: Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude. The main point of the job map is to help the deconstruction of a job that customers are trying to get done, thus with the understanding of customer needs, before considering the opportunities in terms of products or solutions. With that said, I have drawn an analogy from this concept - due to its underlying universality - to provoke us to consider that if the very job of the entrepreneurial is yet another job to be done and conversely many solutions exists: methods, tools, platforms, and more. 

It is hard to blame the environment. If that is good or bad, or, bright or evil, that's how it goes in real life. We know that we are in to break signal from noise, to put on and off that helmet, to think through. That is how we get the credit, from the arena. Plus we know of the needs to learn faster, that we are challenged to be fast learners. Plus we know what it feels to take that helmet off - watching many other runners passing. Plus we know of the challenges and what it means to do that, how far we can go, how philosophical to get, and to wonder if what we see is real or not.

#### In the arena 









<!--
@outline - in and out 
--> 


Let us consider the explosion of accelerators in the world of founders. I will tell you of a particular experience, from 2016 when I had joined a Silicon Valley-based accelerator program that landed in my city in Brazil. My interest started with a background check about the program' reputation. That analysis process took me 15 minutes plus a 2 hour inspiring lecture which ignited my instincts toward working in a big or global idea. The accelerator's CEO seemed well-connected. They also had a well-known startup in their account. Things were looking coherent so I wanted to check their educational resources. All were quality stuff, check, in synch with the modern start-up theories. I leaned towards. I did some initial tests, a screening process, and sent my résumé. Then I was awarded a sponsorship which saved me from the tuition fee. Check, check, check, I got a bagde of an aspiring founder, so 3,2,1, take off. The ride went on for one, two, and three weeks, and then I was a drop out. That came about because command control gave me a penalty - a homework. They gave me an opportunity to cross-correct some moves I did wrong. One, a low score I received from the pitch presentation. In addition to that, and because I scored quite low a colleague from another startup. So they required me to make a formal contract with the buddy and give him 10 hours of work per week, for the duration of the program, which I didn't like or didn't understand so decided todrop out.

@outline - grief 
--> 

Now, as we know, many reflections happens after real complications, like rocket explosions, or from post-mortem exercises. I was mad and wanted to blame them. Then I was energetic and wanted to figure things out. From that incident, or accident, perhaps I took a bargain. I took off that helmet and may have entered a rabbit role. One that took me to be here with you and not continue my start-up project. If this sounds like the phases of one experiencing a major loss, it's not a coincidence. Perhaps this whole book relates to that although in the context of entrepreneurship. Perhaps this foreword is a prelude to a requiem, the startup's requiem or the founder's requiem that takes place before evolving a startup.  










<!-- 
@outline - living the denial 
--> 




Anyway, while being mad I started to dig. Why my pitch wasn't good? All started when they required me to think of three different ideas and then to present to get feedback before picking one. While presenting, I noticed that the mentors loved my 3rd best idea - the one that had to do with splitting bills of students drinking beer in pubs. Right there I felt a problem because that was my weakest idea. And worse, that my top idea where the one which I referred as "yet another slides platform." I was mad because it seemed that their program, from that initial lecture, had motivated me to engage with a bold or global idea. But then, when it was time to judge, they seemed to favor projects with a strong local market bias, as in Brazil's market if not the region where my city is located. I were forging a conspiration theory. 

As you may guess, I wasn't so sure about anything. I was in the arena coming up with some soft guesses and becoming frustrated. I sensed too that other teams that with more cofounders and advanced products or solutions were moving with better traction. Another thing was that the directors and mentors had a stake from the startup pie, from the 3%. So it seemed obvious that the local stakeholders had an interest in financial rewards instead of gambling with bold and global (and weird) ideas. 

As an aside, fast-forward to to 2019, I came across a research paper entitled *How do accelerators select startups? Shifting decision criteria across stages* (Yin & Luo, 2018) that had supported my conspiration work. To be fair, the research had supported the position of accelerators. I mean, supported the idea that accelerators had to engage in first doing rejection and then selection, somewhat in alignment with the idea of focusing on quantitative aspects before qualitative. But anyway that made me coin the "filter-first think-later effect." In other words, I was clearly involved in a phase of denial, escapism, or bargain.

But back to where I were, I also suspected of something like a reality show. I recalled of a situation when the director were giving us a homework. When I wondered about an ambiguity between the homework as presented with the book materials, he said that "we are not in an university." That brought the a whole set of entrepreneurs - not to say students - in the back of the room - not to say class - to laugh hard. I didn't understand what happened but I felt being back to the university 16 years before.

@outline - Blitzscaling

#### Moving on 

Moving on and confused I wondereed. Is it the movement? Is it the program? Is it myself? In other words, a phase of learning had started. This is when the Blitzscaling lectures came my way. My connection with Blitzscaling lectures started with motivations. First, for having worked at Silicon Valley - carrying on love, respect, and hopes - and because of John Lilly, one of the organizers. I didn't know much about John but he were the CEO of Mozilla when I worked a decade ago. In addition, I once heard something special from him, when he and the user experience expert were discussing the future of Firefox. The expert made a point that the perfect tool consists of the actual problem solved, i.e. when the tool is not on the way. That was coherent. But John made another point that through the development of tools, imperfect tools included, teams could make better tools. That was profoundly coherent. I had especially loved that conversation because although it was a video, live and public, it was heated and honest. To watch senior leaders presenting different views in a quite honest setting was quite the opposite of what I have witnessed from that real situation - no video being recorded - which I characterized as a reality show. 

I asked John Lilly if I could help with the subtitles since I wanted to translate to portuguese. I got the subtitles in 2016, recruited a couple friends and we started. Needless to say but worth observing, that when we are subtitling we are watching in slow motion. So we did the first, an interview with Brian Chesky, and the second, the interview with Nirav Tolia. Now to the 3rd talk and when the subtitling project was put on hold. I wasn't following an order but somehow I picked one that was unconventional comparing to the others. While most where interviews, that one was apparently odd - a half lecture and a half interview. That was when I learned about Michael Dearing, or MD, Silicon Valley investor and professor of management. From that point, as an aside, my start-up project consisted of a tool to clip and annotate [^footnote_fastclip] video lectures. From Michael's lecture I end up digging into Harrison Metal's content and was caught by more enlightening views linking management and entrepreneurship. I was fascinated by two of his lectures - *Two Blasts From the Past* and *Executive Communications* - and his views in a course entitled *General Management Two*. Since I felt being conducted into new tracks and perspectives, I end up writing to Michael to say thanks many times.From these resources, I found Barbara Minto, whom, according to Michael her work would change your life. Michael was right. I wrote to her, said thanks many times, had an opportunity to meet her through video. Plus she gave me a copy of her book, *The Minto Pyramid Principle*.

@outline - Back to complication 
--> 


#### The dilemma 

These lectures were special and a change was going on. Now were them amazing because they were amazing or because I was engaged in a slow learning process? That is how it goes in real life. Back to the problem, or a puzzle, Blitzscaling were giving me a viewpoint about the characterizations of great leaders; like a lightning strike happening in slow motion. That's not how I had watched these talks. With that slow watching or subtitling or clipping I had formed a viewpoint for a way of conduct applicable to our start-ups, to the beginning, to the very hour. 

I had found peace between the faster and slower worlds, where values and principles were being used to shock-absorb that fast-paced and accelerated startup way of doing things. It was different, and it sounded like a blessing, or permission to, to hear that scalable startups required a style of leadership very different from those other local accelerator programs. Of course, it is unfair, to compare, starting with the fact that one were a practical program and the other lectures organized as a reflection from a perspective. 

Right there, a major problem I noticed had to do exactly with that "unfair" comparison. I caught myself, as a founder perhaps on in a hurry, forming perceptions about some of these ideal thoughts vs. the power of actual practical things. It's really sad because it takes us to, sometimes, ignore the very nuanced observation from great thoughts, especially when you see that these great thoughts are associated with very special people from very special places, as in from top-tier spaces. In a way it's like we take the inspirational part and ignore the nuanced points forming an argument that the great thinkings from there does not apply to our reality. 

The contrast was clear. As an example, when I wrote a letter to that accelerator's program director, asking a word about why they gave me that specific punishment homework, his answer were "just do it." On the other hand, although the Blitzscaling lectures were essentially about fast growth or startup growth, their reflections through the interviews valued the reflective experience, carried values and principles. How I were navigating my reflections about Blitzscaling seemed to be, although I didn't see at the time precisely, a quest to understand the self, the being, a quest to understand the characterizations of leaders that could actually do that sort of thing. 

#### Circles 

At this stage, I had two circles on my way. One, that practical program which felt confusing and artificial, perhaps toxic. On the other hand, the Blitzscaling circle with some of the above characterizations. But another circle was right in the middle of them, the lean circle. Here is where the name Steve Blank appears. First, because Steve is the father of the lean startup movement, along with Eric Ries of course. Second, because the lean methods were being activelly used, in the arena, by founders alone or teams and also grown up teams trying to do the start-up way. Now, Steve is special because of his values. After some slow-watching with some of his talks I could not avoid noticing too a reflective mindset. His concerns about the actual use of lean were high - how lean methods were being used, and misused. Through the decade before the inception of lean, Steve kept on, as a learner and evolving his his views. As an example, Steve cared to talk about a situation when founders engage in what he sees as being procrastinating with lean - when they claim to be using lean but aren't. Steve kept attentive to how founders would engage with the matter,being lost or less conscious. Steve had also reflected about the meaning of an initial market, aware about how some initial market definitions - among other assumptions - could impact the lean movement. MOre than that, another plus, he had reflected about what means to be a founders, like to consider the founder connection with artists. 

The intersection with these circles meant an opportunity, prompting me to think about initial values that had to be carried over before action, to think about a readiness level, or an awarenes level, or a state of well-being for the founder that required a self-consciousness before movement. 

#### Action

With that gap established, on one hand characterized as echoes of start-up narratives driven by pressures of the accelerated world, and on the other hand a value system characterized by these circles, It was becoming clear the action being taken from these moments and also the potential action in terms of expression, to the world, which became materialized as this book. For me, the encounters with this crew made me to see them as brokers, between different networks. I took myself through a learning experience through online networks that produced an impact perhaps in my min in terms of achieving clarity about values before action applicable to the actual reality of the start-up, especially in the beginning. I came up with an anecdotal image for when new ideas we hear make a change in us. I say that it's like a neuron saying hi to another, far, and strange one. It's the strange neurons encounter. But then by the perspective of this book, I am obliged to pause to celebrate the brokers who them them together. 



That is, when I caught myself involved on a mission to achieve clarity, with an increased interest in helping others, not only founders, but anyone else interested in recovering the true entrepreneurial spirit. We know, from now today, that entrepreneurs are critical to our future. This view goes along with a view according to Maslow (1998, p.232), of entrepreneurs unique place: 

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)

Now, when I read that fast, I miss Maslow's transcending view using an accelerated thinking of reject-first and select-later, as if we are kinds, or species. Assuming the true spirit of an entrepreneur is a character - as in the entrepreneur in all of us - then we align with Maslow's intent and with a big reason to be worried about that gap, especially in a world, or under an accelerated way of moving, that sets that character to be endangered; given that the generalist mindset can be hijacked, to some extent by our perceptions of the world, in ways where a specialist-generalist rises, or a mechanized-generalist. 

With these reflections on your way, my hope is that our moment, initially just the two of us, sets a course to your path like a seed that grows to support the culture of your organization, beyond the two of us. So we are here to remind us to start this kind of conversation. This book is, for me, not different from a place where Dorothea Brande had placed hers, **Becoming a Writer** in *What Writers Are Like*. I just ask you to please replace writer with founder or entrepreneur in their verb with to learn: 

> *"There are some handbooks so valuable that no writer should be without them. .. This book is not even a companion volume to such works as those; it is a preliminary to them. If it is successful it will teach the beginner not how to write, but how to be a writer; and that is quite another thing."* Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)

Likewise, this book has no place among the play books that teaches how to execute a startup. But I do think that it works across the board, for all audiences interested in the entrepreneurial world and the startup ecosystem - founders, to practitioners, to investors, to parents of founders, to the future of founders. Thus, it's for entrepreneurs which are beginners but for the grown up others that recognize that the true entrepreneur is always a learner, an apprentice.
