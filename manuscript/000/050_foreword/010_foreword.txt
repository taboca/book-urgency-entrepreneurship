@outline - Situation lead - rich ecosystem

The good news for entrepreneurs is that their ground allows them to accelerate. The world promises results, for entrepreneurial projects and their lives. In this connected and interactive setting, entrepreneurs are empowered to swiftly navigate towards their goals. This empowerment start with stories that are brithly coherent but further accelerate with them with a rich ecosystem where a lot of resources can be verified as proven such as popular startup methodologies. 

Consider, for example, the cost for acessing motivation from networks, for instance as we can network and be thrilled with stories that enlighten our entrepreneurial spirit. On the other hand, consider the tools, such as methodologies that are proven to advance collaboration. But more than motivation and processes, we are equally able to advance the actual startup using networks of support - the interactive systems where we can get in touch with potential customers, investors, mentors, practitioners, cofounders, partners, and more.

@outline - All started 

* Now, and before we put step towards the introduction, I invite you to consider a visit to when things started to change, to when fast-paced seemed to walk into our world. Then, we shall briefly visualize the world of abundance we caught ourselves into, where the urgencies of our environment sets much of what we do, where attention is limited; and how even the generalist role of an entrepreneur that is now harassed by information overload with all sorts of solutions which are powerful in the sense of boosting them but also becomes challenging and obfuscates their ability to manage what they do. In this regard, we start our mindful instrospection about the entrepreneurial ventures of valuing and respecting the beings and their ability to tame entrepreneurship.

We will get back to that, to what can be a supermarket, networked, and abundant, and how that became a concern for me and reasons to write this book. As I wondered where all of that came from, and a specific moment in time was symbolic to see the changes to the entrepreneurial movement influenced by the world's solutions. If we set our time machine to November 10, 1876, we would witness emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, turned on the massive steam engine at the inauguration of the centennial exhibition of the United States' independence in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. This milestone symbolizes the onset of new era, when the people's clock became faster by likely their attention span shorter. That engine, the Corliss Centennial Engine, became the icon of the exhibition. Standing 14 meters tall and boasting a power of 1400 horse-power, it was responsible for powering the entire exhibition setup, which encompassed more than 200 buildings spread over 5 km in length. (Wikipedia, 2019)

According to historian Maury Klein (2008), the exhibition showcased all the modern wonders of the mechanization of the industrial revolution: machines that prepared molds for printing machines, sewing machines, telegraph devices, locomotives, automatic saws, belt presses, winches, scales, excavators, drilling machines, giant sugarcane mills, cotton presses, stone-crushing machines, diamond drills, stone cutters, various tools, agricultural equipment, carriages, tile and brick-making machines, bookbinding machines, paper-making machines, cardboard, machines for making threads, cables, screws, car wheels, train wheels, and so much more. Machines. I know, it might seem too much to name 26 examples - that now seem antiquated - instead of focusing on big numbers, such as 200 buildings, or the 14 meters steam engine, or the 5 kilometers lenght of the exhibition, or the 10 million visitors, or the 7 days time which one would take to visit the whole exhibition. A bit antiquated for us but nevertheless amusing in size and impact, especially for the ones who experienced the exposition and had a chance to see revolutionary solutions in many sorts of fields as all of these things were new.

These solutions, much of it materialized as mechanical solutions, were fruits of human work and collaboration at the epicenter of a destruction to an economic order; to which in the U.S. heavily based on slavery. The rising new economic model were supported by technological innovations that redefined rules of labor force that went along with societal changes in the system and shaped a new economy. The situation in the United States, the north vs. south confrontation, goes along in sunchronicity characterizing a crisis of the old older and the setting of new order with heavy use of mechanized solutions both supporting products and transportation. 


<!--
As these worlds collided, the industrial revolution defined the economic context that accelerated the destruction of the old economic system based on slavery and gave rise to a new system that brought freedom to certain extent or innovation. 
-->

Now the reason that we start right there it's because through the very early examples of creative innovations and machinery machines, or platforms, or mechanized tools, we can visualize how our lives changed up to how entrepreneurial movement too. Consider, for example, the flour mill created by American inventor Oliver Evans around 1790. Evans' automatic mill [^footnote_oliverevans_mill] was innovative as it eliminated numerous hours of human work and at the same time reduced the risk of contamination. 

![Evan's design for the automated flour mill](images/100/Oliver_Evans_-_Automated_mill.jpg)

[^footnote_oliverevans_mill]: The illustration of Evans' automatic mill, which is in the public domain, was made by James Poupard and documented in the work titled "The Young Mill-Wright & Miller's Guide."

From a perspective, Oliver Evans system created new rules or broke the rules of an existing production system, by setting up a new ground, defining new economic and social order, to a certain extent. As an example, we may consider the rise of the milling industry in the US which is linked to his design. According to Maury Klein, Oliver's design became the reference leading to the rise of US as the world's biggest flour industry.

In terms of the economics dynamics with people's needs, from the widespread distribution of flour through the US and economic movement, we may highlight the higher quality of flour produced, more proper ability to stock accross seasons with less contamination, cheaper prices, as observable effects; this setting observation impacting the consumer angle of but course it goes with the movement the continous development of improved designs, would would cause pain to Oliver by the impossibility to tame or control the widespread of his design which he thought would be protected by the emerging patent system - nevertheless supporting not only the explosion of this industry but the evolution of the milling industry, and related tools and methods, along with transportation, plus also creating demands for skilled people to work with these systems - more specialized environment of production, and of course the unfolding characterizations of the management practice under the needs for improved efficiency in the process. 

This new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come.

[^footnote_creativedestruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development.

Let us consider, back to the future and a few chapters ahead in the history told by Creative Destruction, how people behave and interact in the modern hyperconnected world is certain an area that deserves reflection - an area that shows opportunities but it is challenging. Consider information access, for example, the contrast of a visitor of that 1876 exhibition, where an entire week was needed to fully appreciate it and where only the 10 million who could physically travel to Philadelphia were able to see firsthand the possibilities of a more automated world. Today, with large exhibitions extinct, people are bombarded with #hashtags and stories through the social media walls of their "smart phones." We can now literally walk through hallways of one or multiple exhibition too cheap to visit and too continuous - and too guided by an experience, powered by an algorithm that can literally take us into a tesseract of infinite possibilities. Today, we can find ourselves immersed in a surreal abundance of images, stories, and projections, and a lot more that captivates us with increasingly better sensational narratives, sometimes visceral.

Much of what arises every second is promising, one problem with navigating the digital space is that the visitor can navigate alone, or in the company of a algorithmic guide that favors viewpoints and to take the user, which may follow by instints, to be stuck in the "icecream cart" of the exposition and unable to reach out to new themes. In this world, there are far many solutions to help us now throughout all the process steps [^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap] of the entrepreneurial effort. In other words, the modern entrepreneur is better equipped - if not in a hypermarket of offerings - with solutions that helps them from definition to execution to conclusion. No way all that there is now can be thought, not generally under the circustances and the pace of execution, as a bad ground for founders to start up. Even if their starting journey looks a bit like a desert and quite a lonely place, as soon as entrepreneurs set foot they get to be literally equipped, literally augumented, and literally into a process - which set us them into a readiness state, feeling energetic and being empowered, and ready to action. 

[^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap]: In the article "Mapping the Job-to-be-Done" (Ulwick, 2017), Tony Ulwick defines job map as an "ideal process flow" that customers go through as they are involved in a job to be done. The steps are: Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude. The main point of the job map is to help the deconstruction of a job that customers are trying to get done, thus with the understanding of customer needs, before considering the opportunities in terms of products or solutions. With that said, I have drawn an analogy from this concept - due to its underlying universality - to provoke us to consider that if the very job of the entrepreneurial is yet another job to be done and conversely many solutions exists: methods, tools, platforms, and more.

@outline - Abstraction a16z

But how could we blame abundance, right? Since it is possible to find the right moment in time and space where opportunity to change our future exists for all needs. Because despite the turbulence and potential confusion, we have so much more information and tools of unquestionable quality in front of us, more accessible and cheaper. This should be a factor that promotes an optimistic view, for better chances. And if you dig, it is quite rational as we must agree that we now have much more data, more stories, more references, more tools, more means of interaction, more for growth, and even more. In this regard, we should consider the optimistic view from A16Z, from Marc Andreesseen, from the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley, for where we are going:  

> *"We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life."*  (Andreessen, M., A16z, 2023)

--> 

Marc's note has serious implications to the situation of entrepreneurs, in general, certainly about the richness in the space, and that entrepreneurs are empowered with a raise, in what I like to think of as entrepreneurial power. In other words, when we decide for doing it, we will be right there in front of a explosion of solutions - like processes, tools, methodologies, systems, and more - now in a world that by its abundance - which aren't necessarily evil. But it impact us in many ways. From the good side, we know, we can do it, we have truly that richer entrepreneurial ecosystem. From the bad side, it may take our attention. These extremmes would be the case if we could not reason, just jump as if the world if binary. But since we, entrepreneurs, aren't machines, we then get busy with filtering noise from signal but nevertheless pressured to act, to judge, to decide. The ecosystem of entrepreneurship is what gives us the chance and at the same time can be the trap. 

But we aren't only talking about tools and systems and methods but living in a networked and rich space where we do with social interactions. If on one hand we have the methods and tools on the other hand we have the social fabric, we we may see as the platforms and networks. As an example, let's consider the explosion of accelerators throughout the world. From my own experience, I was able, around 2016, to join a Silicon Valley based accelerator program in my own city. When I started to check about the program's reputation, it was evident that the leader of the program were well connected. Plus, a few well-known startups went through that network. Plus they had a good pitch. So all seemed coherent in terms of the motivational, inspirational narratives, and also I had found good reasons looking at their educational materials. As I were caught by their quality, in terms of knowledge or theories, and the narrative seemed to be a match with some of the narratives from my percepctions of top-tier Silicon Valley programs, I was in. Plus I did a test and got a scholarship so I didn't have to pay. 

Having entered the program I caught myself, three weeks after, out of it. This is so because the program gave me a penalty, a task, which was a chance for course-correcting what I have done. I couldn't really figure why but it had to do with a bad grade I got from a pitch plus something in my behavior. I know that I gave a bad grade to a peer of another startup. Given the penalty they gave me, a homework if you will, and given that I didn't like, I decided to drop the program. 

Now, as we know, usually reflection - certain for the ones executing first thinking later - happens in post-mortem fashion. The first things I did was to be mad, and to blame the problem. First, I noted that program required me to think of three different ideas, to pitch them and get feedback, and to refine. That was weird for me because I suspected that the variability of the ideas and its totally different markets would actually create a sort of complication for myself in terms of values, a potential disconnect of my interest, in case the one receiving best feedback were the one I didn't have the best connection with. In a way, it seemed that the program didn't care about my connection with the idea so much, and I had to deal with that myself. The other thing I realized is that the advisors and mentors were locals; and they seemed pretty much interested in market-specific solutions instead more global or bolder ideas. While the actual program motivated us with big and bold cases of entrepreneurs, from the lectures, when it was about time to judge they seemed to be favoring things that were obviously market-driven in Brazil if not my region. I noticed that when some of the advisors loved my 3rd best idea which had to do with something to split bills of student groups drinking beer in pubs. Yet, I wasn't so sure. It was a kind of a soft guess that something were wrong. Other point is that things were happening in a fast-paced approach - which seemed to not be a problem if not was an actual high-beat mood part of doing things - so the actual potential for digging, as in to wonder, or to have conversations, these sort of dynamics, seemed to be artificial, or superficial. Mostly set in a hurry, and with some filter-first think later mentality, it seemed that the teams that had companies set - with more cofounders and more developed products and solutions for the local market - were moving with better attention of the directors and the mentors through their validating moments. One other characterization were that the directors and mentors had a stake in the startups according to the agreements. In other words, anyone that passed the four weeks time frame would actually be required to give about 3% to the program. So it felt for a moment that they weren't in it for really bold ideas, or things of a global nature. To be fair, perhaps they would detect that if data was obvious. Anyway I had that reflection going on, so clearly a denial of my own poor situation. 

Another thing I did't like was that some characterization of a show, like a TV show, seemed to happening. One day I pointed to the director, giving a lecture, a problem between the homework as told with the homework as given in the book materials, to which he quickly replied that "we are not in an university," and a lot of the participants - not to say students - laughed hard in the back of the room. I didn't get because that situation for me, of myself not able to bring a serious point, seemed to actually be a characterized setting of an university. Nevertheless I had a puzzle, or a prompt, or a páradox, and even started to consider how these interactions could have been misused not only by the founders but also by all the others involved, for example if we were too fast, or mechanized, sort of dancing in a show. Something seemed wrong. 



<!-- 
@outline - Blitzscaling 
--> 

But I kept on, confused but going. Is it the whole movement? Is it that program? Is it myself? And of course it comes, from that point of a denial of your own movement, another learning process, about the self at certain point; which sounds like phases of one experiencing a major loss. So perhaps I were there, having failed miserably, in front of consiering the assumptions about what I were doing. That is when I had entered a new learning zone, since my interest about entrepreneurial action, and entrepreneurship in general, was yet alive in me and I didn't decide to go back to work for a grown-up company. Coincidentally at that time I caught myself in front of the Blitzscaling lectures which became an inflection point taking my attention towards the actual new perspectives and values which took me towards this book eventually. Maybe I paid attention to Blitzscaling too because of my connections with Silicon Valley, for having worked there back in the days, or because of John Lilly who where the CEO of Mozilla when I were an FTE from Brazil. 

Now I didn't know much about John - besides the fact that he were the CEO of Mozilla at the time - but I remembered a great point I heard from him from a heated conversation in an video which was taken out from the web. He were discussing a point about the future of Firefox with an UX expert from Mozilla. And the UX professional said that the perfect tool would consist of the actual problem, or need, solved; as in when the tool is not needed or almost transparent. But John gave a view that I loved. He made his point, that through the development of tools - imperfect tools included - through using it, through collaboration, through conversations, teams could understand the problem and arrive at better tools. I had understood how they both were talking about the same thing. But I loved the angle from John. The video was taken from the web but kept in my heart. So I asked John Lilly to connect me with the subtitles of the Blitzscalinng lectures because I wanted to help to produce, translate, to bring the pt-br ones to help Brazil. So I got the subtitles and recruited a couple friends to help and we did about two of them, Brian and Nirav, amazing lectures, a change to my life, perhaps due to the slow subtitling experience. 

But then, the 3rd I picked were a talk from this person named Michael Dearing. That is when the subtitling project paused. It's on hold up to now, although now we have the book. So I caught myself in front of Michael Dearing talk, stuck, which brings us to Michael Dearing. Michael Dearing, a known Silicon Valley angel investor and professor of management and entrepreneurship brought up his educational system which gave me a new perspective through the works which led me to characterize the book and more precisely some of my current views. This were forming quite slow through the moments which I thought I was making a start-up, named Fast Clip [^footnote_fastclip]. (A side note about Fast Clip: I heard Reid Hoffman saying the word 'fast clip'. So I used that as a name for an idea of a tool which allowed me to clip the Blitzscaling video talks. In other words, the idea consisted of enabling a community of people to study/have conversations about various precious moments from these special videos which happen to have low views but were great. In other words, by clipping, I hoped to bring about good conversations from user collaboration to elevate attention and reflective thinking.) 

[^footnote_fastclip]: Here is a vide of myself presenting some of the ideas of the Fast Clip prototype https://youtu.be/DpZv9Jxk8ZY?si=wOwuqgulr0N2eU4I&t=132

Where I making a start-up or a science project - as Michael would say - or studying and trying to figure something and also struggling with my own struggles as an entrepreneur? This connection with Michael brought me to write to him on various occasions, nevertheless inspired and engaged, which brought me to other great minds like Barbara Minto. I wrote to Barbara too and even had a video call with her, plus she sent to me her book, The Minto Pyramid Principle which was a turning point in my life. Back to Michael, some two or three precious lectures/reflections from Michael were his *Two Blasts From the Past* and the *Executive Communications* and his GM2 course about OKR. Thoughts in alignment with what I think are thoughts from Michael are all over this book, aside from the specific points where Michael appears as a conductor. 

But back to the problem, or the dilemma I had, and through the Blitzscaling, something I was taking, as in answers about that fast mode and the slow mode, about a value-system which perhaps that other program were lacking. When doing the program, it seemed that the leaders and advisor-directors were quite oriented to the actual key results they needed. Oh well, that makes sense right? as it was a practical program. For example, when I wrote a letter to a director asking a word, pointing that I didn't like the task punishment they gave me, the penalty they gave me, and I wanted to talk about that, his answer were as simple as - just do it. That short. No talks, no comments, no considerations. On the other hand, although the Blitzscaling lectures were essentially about fast growth or startup growth, their reflections through the interviews carried something totally different. Blitzscaling showed a reflective experience, with values, with principles. How I were navigating my reflections about Blitzscaling seemed to be, although I didn't see at the time precisely, a quest to understand the self, the being, a quest to understand the characterizations of leaders that could actually do that sort of thing. 

Now, if we go back to other characterizations of the richer geneneral ecosystem, and lean movements were all around, i have to mention Steve Blank. This is so because Steve is a father of the lean startup movement, along with Eric Ries of course, and also because the lean methods were exactly there, in the middle. I mean, perhaps the problem space I were looking, in terms of concentric circles, could be characterized as the accelator closer to you, the lean circle, and the Blitzscaling circle. When editing this section, I did a search across this book work's repository and found 161 results with the term "Steve Blank". A first point to bring Steve, besides his role as a father of the Lean Startup movement, goes back to that sort of characterization and values. After having studied some of his materials, I also observed something in him, also through the videos and interviews, his reflective mindset. I always felt that Steve were concerned about the actual use of lean, how lean methods were using used and misused, as in the behavioral patterns of founders when doing it. As an example his observation about founders procrastinating with lean. In other words, Steve is aware of how founders misuse these methods and he kept going on, quite engaged and attentive, to when founders were lost, or less conscious, or as Eric Ries would put it to lack the view of purpose. Plus, a big plus, Steve had reflected about the role of the founders vs. artists.  






<!-- 
@outline - Back to complication 
--> 

It was becoming clear, through the early studies and drafts before this book, the paradox, or the dilemma, between the produced echoes of Silicon Valley - by narratives, tools, methods, platforms, and accelerated networking systems - driven by need to reach outcomes, with the actual value system of top-tier leaders, not only entrepreneurs but the leaders of the grown-up organizations brought by Blitzscaling, and leading practitioners who cared about the misuses and behaviors. My attention was caught by that perpective, my start-up fading, and the book rising. In other words, through studying Blitzscaling, I started to sense that the people involved in the startups that had achieved success, seemed to be calmer, seemed to be people reading much more, seemed to not follow one or other framework too strictly, seemed to be aware. On the other hand, the anxiety of entrepreneurs, seemed to set themselves to miss listening these voices. This is the gap I caught myself in and set myself to work and by this work I caught myself feeling the need to help others too. 


<!-- 
@outline - real complication 
Contextualize here some nuances of the rational rationality. 
-->

We, as entrepreneurs, who strive to change the world and our lives, recognize the complexities of navigating a stormy sea. But like any environment that needs to change, we don't have time to adjust our routine. We are bound to the pace of acceleration, to the urgent drumbeat, the pressure for decision. We are pushed to decide, to move forward. Consider, for example, how we are bombarded by a torrent of information, we are immersed in constant overexposure that submerges us in a sea of choices. The channels we subscribe, the "newspapers" we read, and the systems and networks that shape behaviors; with data, with what we think as "good reasons," empowering us to the next step. In this environment, entrepreneurs might see themselves as protagonists, empowered to execute faster with a feeling of certainty to an iminent success.

But why a book geared towards entrepreneurs? First, because we are all entrepreneurs, even if we're just navigating our own lives. Second, entrepreneurs who strive to better the world are the ones genuinely in need to improve entrepreneurship itself. In other words, the impact of entrepreneurship feeds back into a more appropriate approach to both entrepreneurship and management. But, as it is evident from my motivations, the entrepreneur, or the true entrepreneurial characterization, can be living an attack endegered species. Third, according to Maslow (1998, p.232), entrepreneurs warrant attention because they play key roles in societies:

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)

Maslow's message reinforces a perspective of an entrepreneur as a role that transcends other specialists roles and in fact can support anyone. In this regard, support for the entrepreneurial role is support for a reflective moment as an opportunity to  understanding of navigation, organization, productivity, and conscious entrepreneurship. For entrepreneurs, interested in being around, for their lasting business or as professionals. A call for slowing down has more to do with the needs reflective character that respects the self, and respect the new cycles too. 

The consideration here is that the generalist role which is a must from the entrepreneur might be in part mechanized. I have considered that, with the many resources that were light to my perosnal path, brought me to see the bundled situation, the fworld; and a need for us to move our entrepreneurship with a willingness to unbundle things, such as the pathways of entrepreneurship. 

May this reflection be in your way, my hope is that you will see what is out there in different ways. You will be a more conscious entrepreneur, I hope. My hope is that our reflection will plant a seed in your path, on your course, one that will grow and spread through the culture of organization. This is not so because of any recipe, precise playbook given, but by the very moment that you took to join this as a conversation. For me, through this book reading moment, you have reflections from my learning experiences rooted in the work of individuals - such as managers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners - who inspired because they made a point about the necessity to be conscious, and for a conscious form of entrepreneurship. Thus, this book may carry on reflections but also stands as an accessible resource which calls for a conversation. 

I think that the intention of this book is not different from a perspective from "What Writers are Like," from "Becoming a Writer" by Dorothe Brande, where she had beautifully positioned her book outside the domain of craftsmanship: 

> *"There are some handbooks so valuable that no writer should be without them. .. This book is not even a companion volume to such works as those; it is a preliminary to them. If it is successful it will teach the beginner not how to write, but how to be a writer; and that is quite another thing."* Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)

<!--
@references

-->

Likewise, I feel that this book has no place among many play books that teaches how to execute a startup. But I do think that it works across the board, for all audiences interested in the entrepreneurial world and the startup ecosystem. Thus, it's for entrepreneurs which are beginners but for the grown up others that recognize that the true entrepreneur is always a learner, an apprentice.
