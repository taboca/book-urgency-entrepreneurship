The good news for entrepreneurs is that their ground allows them to accelerate. The world promises results, for entrepreneurial projects and their lives. In this connected and interactive setting, entrepreneurs are empowered to swiftly navigate towards their goals. This empowerment start with stories that are brithly coherent but further accelerate with them with a rich ecosystem where a lot of resources can be verified as proven such as popular startup methodologies. 

Consider, for example, the cost for acessing motivation from networks, for instance as we can network and be thrilled with stories that enlighten our entrepreneurial spirit. On the other hand, consider the tools, such as methodologies that are proven to advance collaboration. But more than motivation and processes, we are equally able to advance the actual startup using networks of support - the interactive systems where we can get in touch with potential customers, investors, mentors, practitioners, cofounders, partners, and more. 

We will get back to that, to that supermarket, hyper. For now, where all of that came from?

Now, and before we put step towards the introduction, I invite you to consider a visit to when things started to change, to when fast-paced seemed to walk into our world. Then, we shall briefly visualize the world of abundance we caught ourselves into, where the urgencies of our environment sets much of what we do, where attention is limited; and how even the generalist role of an entrepreneur that is now harassed by information overload with all sorts of solutions which are powerful in the sense of boosting them but also becomes challenging and obfuscates their ability to manage what they do. In this regard, we start our mindful instrospection about the entrepreneurial ventures of valuing and respecting the beings and their ability to tame entrepreneurship. 

Now, as for the environment and the accelerated pace of the world, or how the acceleration started to change our way of thinking and acting in the world, I invite you to set our time machine to November 10, 1876. On this date, the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, activated [^editornote_check_activated] a massive steam engine at the inauguration of the centennial exhibition of the United States' independence in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. This milestone symbolizes the onset of new era, perhaps when the people's clock became faster. The engine, named the Corliss Centennial Engine, became the icon of the exhibition. Standing 14 meters tall and boasting a power of 1400 horse-power, it was responsible for powering the entire exhibition setup, which encompassed more than 200 buildings spread over 5 km in length. (Wikipedia, 2019)

[^editornote_check_activated]: Editor note: Check the word "activated" from the book of Maury Klein, The Power Makers. 

![Illustration of the Corliss Engine, public domain.](images/100/CentennialEngine.png)

According to historian Maury Klein (2008), the exhibition showcased all the modern wonders of the mechanization of the industrial revolution: machines that prepared molds for printing machines, sewing machines, telegraph devices, locomotives, automatic saws, belt presses, winches, scales, excavators, drilling machines, giant sugarcane mills, cotton presses, stone-crushing machines, diamond drills, stone cutters, various tools, agricultural equipment, carriages, tile and brick-making machines, bookbinding machines, paper-making machines, cardboard, machines for making threads, cables, screws, car wheels, train wheels, and so much more. Machines. I know, it might seem too much to name 26 examples - that now seem antiquated - instead of focusing on big numbers, such as 200 buildings, or the 14 meters steam engine, or the 5 kilometers lenght of the exhibition, or the 10 million visitors, or the 7 days time which one would take to visit the whole exhibition. A bit antiquated for us but nevertheless amusing in size and impact, especially for the ones who experienced the exposition and had a chance to see revolutionary solutions in many sorts of fields as all of these things were new.

--> 

These solutions, much of it materialized as mechanical solutions, were fruits of human work and collaboration at the epicenter of a destruction to an economic order heavily based on slavery. The rising new economic model were supported by technological innovations that redefined rules of labor force that went along with societal changes in the system and shaped a new economy. The situation in the United States, the north vs. south confrontation, illustrated the advancement of the new order and how it deconstructed a present economic order where slavery persisted. As these worlds collided, the industrial revolution defined the economic context that accelerated the destruction of the old economic system based on slavery and gave rise to a new system that brought freedom to certain extent or innovation. This new pace, a new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come.

[^footnote_creativedestruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development.

To better illustrate the formation of a new platform, consider the flour mill created by American inventor Oliver Evans around 1790. Evans' automatic mill [^footnote_oliverevans_mill] was innovative as it eliminated numerous hours of human work and at the same time reduced the risk of contamination. 

![Evan's design for the automated flour mill](images/100/Oliver_Evans_-_Automated_mill.jpg)

[^footnote_oliverevans_mill]: The illustration of Evans' automatic mill, which is in the public domain, was made by James Poupard and documented in the work titled "The Young Mill-Wright & Miller's Guide."

The new entrepreneurial order, born from the process of Creative Destruction, broke the rules of the "previous game" but at the same time established new rules, and a new economic and social order. And with that, room is being made for the next cycle. Therefore, this very example depicts how innovative solutions responded as viable, or were favored, in the face of the historical context of the dismantling of a system based on slavery. 










<!-- 
@outline - complication - size of the beast 
--> 


And back to the future, in front of a new order, we have different challenges that prevents, or provokes, entrepreneurs from making the world a better place. Challenges that prevents and conversely creates the opportunity. Therefore, if we look at entrepreneurship from the lenses of creative destruction, we shall first recognize that revolutions are set in a way that rewrite the platform, and history, or act as a macroeconomic force that unbundles the reality, then bundling comes our new as new economic platforms, which enables a reality that might provoke us to either comform, and accept the rules, or join the call for unbundling again and seeking opportunities. In other words, our celebration for what brought us to be here, after cycles of the Creative Destruction process, is less about celebrating all the aspects of the world as we have inherited. In other words, it is undeniable that live in a world that needs help, as we look at the macro outset, our planet's horizon, and the rise in diseases linked to diet, the rise of unhealthy lifestyle, the rise of stress, or the destruction of our nature, and even general attention loss of people. The celebration can be turned for respecting how big are the consequences of any revolutinary platform that changes the economic order, and our lives, as in the raise the respect for "the size of the beast" which might help us to put order, or to be aware, for how much we can be stick into a societal and economic reality, for good or bad. 

Let us consider, back to the future and a few chapters ahead in the history told by Creative Destruction, how people behave and interact in the modern hyperconnected world is certain an area that deserves reflection - an area that shows opportunities but it is challenging. Consider information access, for example, the contrast of a visitor of that 1876 exhibition, where an entire week was needed to fully appreciate it and where only the 10 million who could physically travel to Philadelphia were able to see firsthand the possibilities of a more automated world. Today, with large exhibitions extinct, people are bombarded with #hashtags and stories through the social media walls of their "smart phones." The irony is that although we can literally walk through hallways of an exhibition which is cheap and continuous, and it not difficult to be guided by the an experience, likely powered by an algorithm, that can literally take us into a tesseract of infinite possibilities including to be stuck in the dimension of the food carts. Today, we can find ourselves immersed in a surreal abundance of images, stories, and projections, and a lot more that captivates us with increasingly better sensational narratives, sometimes visceral. But how could we blame abundance, right? Since it is possible to find the right moment in time and space where opportunity to change our future exists for all. Still, although much of what arises every second is promising, one problem with navigating the digital space is that the visitor can navigate alone, or in the company of a algorithmic guide that favors instints such as to take them to be stuck in the "icecream cart" of the exposition and unable to reach out to new themes. 





In this world, there are far many solutions to help us now throughout all the process steps [^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap] of the entrepreneurial effort. In other words, the modern entrepreneur is better equipped - if not in a hypermarket of offerings - with solutions that helps them from definition to execution to conclusion. No way all that there is now can be thought, not generally under the circustances and the pace of execution, as a bad ground for founders to start up. Even if their starting journey looks a bit like a desert and quite a lonely place, as soon as entrepreneurs set foot they get to be literally equipped, literally augumented, and literally into a process - which set us them into a readiness state, feeling energetic and being empowered, and ready to action. 

[^footnote_tonyulwick_jobmap]: In the article "Mapping the Job-to-be-Done" (Ulwick, 2017), Tony Ulwick defines job map as an "ideal process flow" that customers go through as they are involved in a job to be done. The steps are: Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude. The main point of the job map is to help the deconstruction of a job that customers are trying to get done, thus with the understanding of customer needs, before considering the opportunities in terms of products or solutions. With that said, I have drawn an analogy from this concept - due to its underlying universality - to provoke us to consider that if the very job of the entrepreneurial is yet another job to be done and conversely many solutions exists: methods, tools, platforms, and more.

Therefore, we are in a paradoxal situation. Because despite the turbulence and potential confusion, we have so much more information and tools of unquestionable quality in front of us, more accessible and cheaper. This should be a factor that promotes an optimistic view, for better chances. And if you dig, it is quite rational as we must agree that we now have much more data, more stories, more references, more tools, more means of interaction, more for growth, and even more. In this regard, we should consider the optimistic view from A16Z, the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley, for where we are going:  

> "We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life." 
> (Andreessen, 2023)

This situation does not put the entrepreneur out of the opportunities and risk in of the party. In other words, in front of a explosion of solutions - like processes, tools, methodologies, systems, and more - our attention can be limited and we might be pressured to act, to judge, to decide. The ecosystem of entrepreneurship is what gives us the chance and at the same time can be the trap. One thing we know - we are compelled to move fast, with decisions, and informed decisions. But also superficial analysis will find our way.

However, entrepreneurs who try to execute their processes are also equally fit to operate in the current economic environment or platform, for instance, continuing the accelerated movement where prioritization of execution is the motto. This is not just because they can't see that they are victims of the economic system, but because they genuinely see many opportunities in the economic system as it stands. In other words, there are no compelling reasons - such as the evident chaos of a decaying society - that could help them see why to change. Under these conditions, it's not easy to recognize the pace at which the entrepreneurial system conditions them, especially in a hyperconnected environment, faced with a plethora of technologies, tools, methods, approaches, systems - all promising to support decisions and introduce solutions into the current machinery.



Echoes of Silicon Valley, rethoric, by tools, methods, platforms, and accelerated networking systems; with a great deal of rethoric and values and reasons. 




We, as entrepreneurs, who strive to change the world and our lives, recognize the complexities of navigating a stormy sea. But like any environment that needs to change, we don't have time to adjust our routine. We are bound to the pace of acceleration, to the urgent drumbeat, the pressure for decision. We are pushed to decide, to move forward. Consider, for example, how we are bombarded by a torrent of information, we are immersed in constant overexposure that submerges us in a sea of choices. The channels we subscribe, the "newspapers" we read, and the systems and networks that shape behaviors; with data, with what we think as "good reasons," empowering us to the next step. In this environment, entrepreneurs might see themselves as protagonists, empowered to execute faster with a feeling of certainty to an iminent success;

But why a book geared towards entrepreneurs? First, because we are all entrepreneurs, even if we're just navigating our own lives. Second, entrepreneurs who strive to better the world are the ones genuinely in need to improve entrepreneurship itself. In other words, the impact of entrepreneurship feeds back into a more appropriate approach to both entrepreneurship and management. 

Third, according to Maslow (1998, p.232), entrepreneurs warrant attention because they play key roles in societies:

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)

Maslow's message reinforces a perspective of an entrepreneur as a role that transcends other specialists roles and in fact can support anyone. In this regard, support for the entrepreneurial role is support for a reflective moment as an opportunity to  understanding of navigation, organization, productivity, and conscious entrepreneurship. For entrepreneurs, interested in being around, for their lasting business or as professionals. A call for slowing down has more to do with the needs reflective character that respects the self, and respect the new cycles too. It is by respecting creative destruction process, its powerful magnificent power - that solidifies a reality that recycles the economic order - is about respecting the new order, the new platofrm, new rules; up to the point of recognizing the abundance of options of now, modern entrepreneurship, and including any traps we might be into it. We are bundled in the package of now. Respect that what destroyed, prior order, was creatively destroyed. Respect that first shall lead us to respect ourselves as the beings that can free ourselves. See, it is not easy to see the needs to free ourselves which might lead to innovation, truly. In order to see problems, you have to be into the reflective state to see things as problematic. I have considered that, with the many resources that were light to my perosnal path, brought me to see the bundled situation, the fworld; and a need for us to move our entrepreneurship with a willingness to unbundle things, such as the pathways of entrepreneurship. 





This book, for instance, arose from my learning experiences rooted in the work of individuals - such as managers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners - who inspired me as they champion a more conscious form of entrepreneurship. Thus, this book is a culmination of lessons learned, but it also stands as an accessible resource, an organized body of knowledge, spurring debate. Even though it might be finalized in editions, it remains fluid in terms of knowledge and inspiration in a broader discussion.

@outline - Blitzscaling

Now, back to the context of this author of yours, what we may really miss from the stories of successful entrepreneurs and the rule book, is that they won't bother to document these things of the human operating system.In this journey which was not the end, which naturally involves more learning, I had started to notice voices that seemed to support in this direction, to my surprise quite clear from the interviews of the Blitzscaling lectures. In other words, through studying Blitzscaling, I started to sense that the people involved in the startups that had achieved success, seemed to be calmer, seemed to be people reading much more, seemed to not follow one or other framework too strictly, seemed to be aware. On the other hand, the anxiety of entrepreneurs, seemed to set themselves to miss listening these voices. This is the gap I caught myself in and set myself to work and by this work I caught myself feeling the need to help others too.

Chris Yeh seems to be the project leader of Blitzscaling but of course it could be Reid Hoffman or John Lilly or other who they think are into the Blitzscaling crew, that loved the Blitzscaling effort, and used it as a reflective opportunity to learn, and who saw that from the Blitzscaling lectures a lot more can be taken or extracted. Aside from this work arriving in the hands of John and Reid, it seems to me as key to first be brought to Chris Yeh; a view that was enriched after I read something from his personal page, about his interested to help certain people with certain projects. When I went on to track down how I came to find Blitzscaling, the network movement shows John Lilly: I were paying attention to him from the Mozilla days, when I were the one FTE from Brazil between 2005-2008. At a point in time I watched a video featuring him and an UX expert from Mozilla - one which was a heated conversation - and a turning point were when he pointed a thought that tools in progress would be a way for people to improve their tools and themselves. I liked that. One day I asked John Lilly to connect me with the subtitles of the Blitzscalinng lectures because I wanted to help tohungry do the pt-br ones. He did and a person named Michael Inouye from Greylock sent to me all the subtitles. I started, asked two friends to help, we did about three of them, Brian and Nirav. So I caught myself in front of Michael Dearing talk, the 3rd one, and I got stuck, the subtitling project paused there. 

Which brings us to Michael Dearing. Michael educational system was an inflection point which gave me a new perspective through the works which led me to characterize the book and my own views. This were forming quite slow through the moments which I thought I was making a start-up, named Fast Clip. (A side note about Fast Clip: I heard Reid Hoffman saying the word 'fast clip'. So I used that as a name for this tool which allowed me to clip the Blitzscaling video talks. In other words, the idea consisted of enabling a community of people to study/have conversations about various precious moments from these special videos which happen to have low views. In other words, by clipping, conversations from user collaboration would elevate attention and reflective thinking. Ref 2017 notes using the Fast Clip prototype https://youtu.be/DpZv9Jxk8ZY?si=wOwuqgulr0N2eU4I&t=132). Where I making a start-up or a science project - as Michael would say - or studying and trying to figure something and also struggling with my own struggles as an entrepreneur? This connection with Michael brought me to write to him on various occasions, nevertheless inspired and engaged, which brought me to know Barbara Minto, her work, initially. I wrote to Barbara too and even had a video call with her too, and she sent to me her book. Some two or three precious lectures/reflections from Michael were his *Two Blasts From the Past* and the *Executive Communications* and his GM2 course about OKR. Thoughts in alignment with what I think are thoughts from Michael are all over this book, aside from the specific points where Michael appears as a conductor. I would appreciate if Michael had the time, and patience, to read the entire manuscript, perhaps before any 'professional' editor touches it. But if not possible to read all, I hope he could read the chapters Running, Impact, and the one on Communication towards the end. While Michael knows a lot more about all of this - what I have written is elementary to him - maybe through my voice I was able to write as a founder-entrepreneur who were into the struggle and then perhaps provided a view from certain goggles of a founder in the middle of the process of execution and learning; which may activate the mind of the reader to reflect from perspective.  

Now here it comes Steve Blank, and I don't know if Steve is beyond all of them or not; so I can't put order here, if I were to have one wish for a request for support - by comments or reading or notes or a foreword you name it. Right now, I did a search across this book work's repository and found 161 results with the term "Steve Blank". A first point to bring Steve in is that he is a known father of the Lean Startup movement; and this book certainly acknowledgess that many founders will stumble in lean startup and the lean-like methods, it's a situation for a complication that may happen with many of them. Then the fact that Steve is aware of how founders misuse tools and methods - and that he kept on engaged and attentive to when they lack awareness, of as Eric Ries would put it lack the view of purpose - sets Steve to be in. Plus, a big plus, Steve had reflected about the role of the founders vs. artists. 

Now, Julia Cameron, through the Right to Write, said that the author will launch anyway, it's a self publishing effort. And I know, that writing is a very collaborative process which many can't see that. In other words, John and Chris and Reid and Michael and Steve, and many others, have already supported this work. My intention to connect with them is above all an intention to hear their voices and also to be very open to any perspectives they have to make this book real and in the hands of good people. I would also accept, if any of them wanted, this to be a joint effort; if some of them see that makes sense to be a co-author, or something like an angel investor role, or other characterizations of support. I think that they have to see this before a professional editor touches. Moreover, I may also need their views before that final professional editor stage which may, if I am not well advised, destroy the work. I rather have the work enriched than destroyed.

But this book isn't anything like those necessary play books based on great stories of things successful. In addition, this author didn't bring about any invention or successful organization that would pass the filter-first think-later paradigm of selection. When I became a volunteer for Mozilla - the not-for-profit organization that created the popular Firefox browser - and people asked me what I do, my answer were that I work for a non-profitable organization.   





Given that a lot of attention are invested by entrepreneurs as they all get up and get things done up to the moment they sleep, I feel that this conversation, and your reflections from it about our behaviours navigating through abundance, will be worth. May this reflection be in your way, my hope is that you will see how much of what is out there will become valuable. You will be a more conscious entrepreneur and I hope interested in reflecting before buying offerings of the space. My hope is that our reflection will plant a seed in your path, on your course, one that will grow and spread through the culture of organization.  

I think that the intention of this book is not different from a perspective from "What Writers are Like," from "Becoming a Writer" by Dorothe Brande, where she had beautifully positioned her book outside the domain of craftsmanship: 

> *"There are some handbooks so valuable that no writer should be without them. .. This book is not even a companion volume to such works as those; it is a preliminary to them. If it is successful it will teach the beginner not how to write, but how to be a writer; and that is quite another thing."* Brand, Dorothea (General Press, 2019, p.19)

Likewise, I feel that this book has no place among many play books that teaches how to execute a startup. But I do think that it works across the board, for all audiences interested in the entrepreneurial world and the startup ecosystem. Thus, it's for entrepreneurs which are beginners but for the grown up others that recognize that the true entrepreneur is always a learner, an apprentice.
