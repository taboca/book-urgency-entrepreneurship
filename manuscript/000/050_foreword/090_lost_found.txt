Now if you're characterized as a part entrepreneur or not fully qualified entrepreneur yet or not fully qualified investor, practitioner, but you are still involved in all this, we are all sharing the same entrepreneurial spirit or we share our interest with the entrepreneurial function, which is that we strive to change the world in our lives. We want to be in the equation, therefore we are aimed to recognize the complex of navigating this stormy sea.

Our environment - of tools, methods, and the social mechanisms - given by this now networked and digital world, sometimes looks like that salt lake flat. They invite us to join and to accelerate. And we know, of the so many things in front of us, an abundant world of solutions, with voices, narratives, tools, methods, platforms, and networks - all which give us a means for interacting and iterating. While it can be overwhelming, we don't see all of that as a flat land meant to slow us down. In reality, what we see, and what we get, are things to boost us, to take us to move even faster. Consider, for example, the cost to access motivation from these networks. We can be thrilled with stories that enlighten our entrepreneurial spirit. On the other hand, consider the tools, or methods, that are proven to advance collaboration. But more than motivation and processes, we are equally able to advance the actual startup using actual networks of support, the interactive spaces where we can get in touch with potential customers, investors, mentors, practitioners, cofounders, partners, and more. 

## Creative Destruction 

This new pace, a new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come.

[^footnote_creativedestruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development.



## Future hashtags 

Let us consider, back to the future and a few chapters ahead in the history told by Creative Destruction, how people behave and interact in the modern hyperconnected world is certain an area that deserves reflection - an area that shows opportunities but it is challenging. Consider information access, for example, the contrast of a visitor of that 1876 exhibition, where an entire week was needed to fully appreciate it and where only the 10 million who could physically travel to Philadelphia were able to see firsthand the possibilities of a more automated world. Today, with large exhibitions extinct, people are bombarded with #hashtags and stories through the social media walls of their "smart phones." The irony is that although we can literally walk through hallways of an exhibition which is cheap and continuous, and it not difficult to be guided by the an experience, likely powered by an algorithm, that can literally take us into a tesseract of infinite possibilities including to be stuck in the dimension of the food carts. Today, we can find ourselves immersed in a surreal abundance of images, stories, and projections, and a lot more that captivates us with increasingly better sensational narratives, sometimes visceral. But how could we blame abundance, right? Since it is possible to find the right moment in time and space where opportunity to change our future exists for all. Still, although much of what arises every second is promising, one problem with navigating the digital space is that the visitor can navigate alone, or in the company of a algorithmic guide that favors instints such as to take them to be stuck in the "icecream cart" of the exposition and unable to reach out to new themes. 


## future, creative destruction, stressed world, diet, nature. 

And back to the future, in front of a new order, we have different challenges that prevents, or provokes, entrepreneurs from making the world a better place. Challenges that prevents and conversely creates the opportunity. Therefore, if we look at entrepreneurship from the lenses of creative destruction, we shall first recognize that revolutions are set in a way that rewrite the platform, and history, or act as a macroeconomic force that unbundles the reality, then bundling comes our new as new economic platforms, which enables a reality that might provoke us to either comform, and accept the rules, or join the call for unbundling again and seeking opportunities. In other words, our celebration for what brought us to be here, after cycles of the Creative Destruction process, is less about celebrating all the aspects of the world as we have inherited. In other words, it is undeniable that live in a world that needs help, as we look at the macro outset, our planet's horizon, and the rise in diseases linked to diet, the rise of unhealthy lifestyle, the rise of stress, or the destruction of our nature, and even general attention loss of people. The celebration can be turned for respecting how big are the consequences of any revolutinary platform that changes the economic order, and our lives, as in the raise the respect for "the size of the beast" which might help us to put order, or to be aware, for how much we can be stick into a societal and economic reality, for good or bad.
