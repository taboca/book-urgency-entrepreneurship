## Outline 2.1 

* Pitch - Welcome to a book about getting things done in a particular situation, in the context of founders doing a startup in the line of growth. Context of the growth path of startups, defining the start situation, which requires evolving; and with that the conscious view for self growth of founders; it may require to see them as not expendable resources. 

* Situation - Define the particular situation of the start-up the growth path; and the implied requirements for self-growth; 

* Situation - Consider the environment, abudance, arguments, and coherence, resources and the information. 

* Situation - By the environment that is promising, abundant, it supports the narrative of growth, the right way. And there is a lot, methods, tools, and more. But it feels bad to open the gap, in the face of specialist doer, getting things done feels nice. Feels bad to stop to lean, from the corporate and the world as we know it, the mother situation and baby, slowing down is not nice. 

* Complication - The getting things done situation, which requires creative thinking and a wider view, a conscious view, is now happening in a particularly specialized environment, although one promising but its abundance, offers challenging space. One which in particular feels great or performant, asking to do, setting us to fear the slow/opening gap, reflective, more and more. Setting us to capture the prize, to validate.. And that sets the complication of change, as comparative analysis. 

* Complication - Feels bad for us and for the worker. Us, learning again seen as pain versus execution better. Corporations, specialist, expenddable, Guacamole instead of trainig, observable. 

* Question - Why should I slow down? 

* A - Because of the environment teasing on three levels, to consider, 3 dimensions, data, methods/tools, and decision making by narratives. B - Because the being - from the individual, to the team, to the institution. 

* Backlog - ## Driving under the influence of the need for speed (driving, enduro)
* Backlog - ## Who invented the specialist? (fun, flair, soda, office space, just do it) 
* Backlog - ## Seeking greatness, grain by grain (abstract, slow vs. fast)

### Punchline - 
 
- Slowing down feels bad, while the urge to hurry up and run feels better.
- Slowing down is associated with uncertainty, whereas running feels connected with certainty.
- This is not necessarily a corporate issue but a general life trend, although corporations may have added some fun to it.
- The new language of "hurry up" or "run" is reinforced by digital signals like claps, likes, and votes in collaborative environments.

### 2. Impact on Founders

- Founders are driven to pursue small grains of success obsessively.
- This obsession can lead to missing larger opportunities.
  - Small successes may not align with the external environment and desired outcomes.
  - Reduced attention spans, reduced level of calmess, leads to becoming specialists, seeking to be right, and professionals, but missing broader opportunities.
- Moreover, eergy is wasted by focusing on misleading goals, preventing greater achievements.

### 3. Situational Alert

- The general language of action, in life and corporate world suggests using humans as expendable resources.
  - Example: High spending on guacamole (positive experience) vs. low spending on training (boring but necessary).
- Founders cannot replace themselves and must take care not to see themselves as expendable.
- For us all, and founders too, retrospective fixing our actions are costly and should be avoided.

### 4. Complications from Situations

- The fast-paced, networked environment dictates what to do, how to do, and why to do it.
- The hypermarket of solutions provides answers for everything, creating a positive bias in decision-making.
- Generalist of the shelf, entrepreneurship confused with BAU 

### 5. General situation for the Book

- In the hyper-fast, hyper-networked space
- Punch - there is a need to pull the handbrake.
- Punch - Watch out for the "need for speed" and escape the "land of confusion."
- Referencing Maslow, the enlightened being may not follow the environment blindly. 
- We now can get then, data, tools, and flow to be more conscious in entrepreneurial movements.

* "I'm going to dictate an outline here and please give me back the outline organized. So this is the outline for the introduction for the book Slow Down to Startup. First point is that there is a pitch, a punchline that to slow down feels bad and the voice of hurry up and running feels better in general because slow down is uncertain and running is likely connected with certainty and this is not necessarily to blame the corporation work because it's life in general although the corporation may have added some fun to that as in it's fun to work as in that the new language of quote hurry up or run comes out as the coherent and not so noisy digital signals given by the collaboration giving claps and likes and votes. Now another point is the impact for founders from that is that we're being driven by pursuing the little grains of successes and as in obsessively the other sub point is that leads us to miss opportunities because from our little grains of steps and successes we may stumble into not the one that's really great in terms of the external environment and the outcomes you want in other words we're specialists and professionals or we run into as being right because our attention span is reduced for supporting. The other sub point here is that we're missing our energy by focusing misleading ourselves perhaps from doing greater things. Now the other point in the outline third point is the situational and alert for us that there's a general language of action therefore given by life in the corporate world and leading taking us to not to use humans as spendable resources for example guacamole spending corporations can be high because that feeds positiveness while spending training is low because that would be about celebrating boredness or uncertainty. In other words we're thinking ourselves expendable that's a situational alert for founders because you cannot replace yourself necessarily you have to actually take care and because we shouldn't be doing things in retrospect that's high cost for us. Now fourth point in this outline is the complication from that situations that we have by the network and the fast-paced environment we're basically being told what to do how to do and why to do and because this is now a hyper market of solutions and there are basically answers for everything so positiveness for decision-making is happening for every single thing in entrepreneurship as well. That leads us to the other point in this outline there's a general inclination of the book that in this hyper fast hyper networked space we need to pull the handbrake to watch out for a quote need for speed that quote and get out from this quote land of confusion quote and here we should consider the idea from Maslow that the enlightened being is not could be perhaps not the one that follows the environment now from that the other point is to celebrate the actual three aspects where the one click accelerated world is telling us what to do what to do and why to do and how to do by data by tools and by the flow and then what comes next are the three parts for us to be more conscious about our movements into the entrepreneurial world."

## V2.6 Strategy, abstract, subject, and SCqA 

* Strategy - Avoid - Not touch on transcendence, such as the pratical transcendence that could be linked to creative destruction of the self - was touched on foreword. (kl-050.3)
* Strategy - Avoid - Don't dig into supermarket of abundance details. (kl-050.2)
* Strategy - Evolve - From supermarket, reach out to expendable. (kl-100.)

* Abstract - introduction - The need to break the "ongoing conversation" of the corporate world as a train that affects how we work, and also has mechanized the entrepreneurial behavior. Situation is that if try to stop the train, is bad or slow, as opposed to urgent and fast. Complication is that urgent models defines our behaviors. Let's introduce abundance of current platform - with data, and tools and systems - supports mechanized cognition. With limited attention span as culturally accepted (foreword has covered this). With growth systems which enlarges risks. Reasons for moving forward is awareness, conscious entrepreneurship. Part 1,2,3. 
 
* Subject - There is an "ongoing conversation" and an "ongoing train" in the corporate world - one that is fast, urgent, frenetic, or fast paced. Even for entrepreneurs, which are generally required to be generalists, they find themselves onto certain tracks when engage to execute their startups. These tracks show on their ways, like train tracks, calls for urgent and fast paced approach to entrepreneurship; which can prevent them to see how to be effective managers of their entrepreneurial effort.  

* Situation - Culture intro - Entrepreneurs falls in traps as they navigate the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, or the fast-paced culture of entrepreneurship. Ongoing conversation is real. Narratives are real. Such as failing. Well, falling is not even perceived as trap but as part of the equation, to fail and learn, or to learn fast. So, right there, after a fail, no time to reflect. But the situation is that the generalist mindset can run as a mechanized approach to entrepreneurship in the face of the urgent, frenetic, fast-paced, world of entrepreneurship; where being faster is coherent and goes well with good reasons to move fast, such as access to knowlege, role models, stories, methodologies, data, and support systems such as investors and other systems for scaling. 

* Complication - The complication is that a lot of models exist to help, like lean methologies which are strong, but it is undeniable that in the fast-paced setting, or when attention span is limited, and pressure for growth is present, entrepreneurs might be trapped - not by the tools but - by themselves, as they fail to reflect, to judge, to see from above, to shock-absorb their behaviors, to revisit and review how they are managers of entrepreneurship. 

* Support - kl-100.1 - As individuals, we are compelled in an action machine, the specialist mode for all areas, the world of work. Thus a language of action, a train that can't lose momentum, is not only need for hurry with; but it is connected with data/information abundance, tools abundance and platform systems. These are resources that git into coherent stories of action. 

* Support - kl-100.2 - We face the pressure also from peers, as we move into tribes. We have pressure as systems and supporting growth models too. We deny respecting peers. 

* Support - We have mechanized decision with data, tools, and systems. Thinking that they are moving into the next stage. Example, as in foreword we had "shop for solutions", Michael points "out the shelf" actions like "Hiring people" check blitzscaling talk. There is no way, time, to keep management open, to think how they are doing, as urgency drives them to deliver, to focus in what. Breaks them from breaking the norm of excitement which breaks them to unfold the "moving across" of Michael. 

* Structure of book.
