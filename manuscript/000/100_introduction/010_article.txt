* @todo - p1 (Done, reviewed with the idea of this beinng hard in the face of action energy) - In Introduction - Leading paragraph - On "getting things done" and "initial energy" against "slowness". On the first, leading paragraph, of the Introduction, I have started with "getting things done", and then saying and acknowledging that as a pretty strong statement. The prior elaboration had to do with an idea of some "faster" ways of doing it, as in gambling or to capture prizes. These can be valid but it may call the attention of the reader too far. In this review I consider that to be slow can be too daring in the face of the actual energetic movement; in other words because the team starts in energetic ways, with motivation, and inspiration, or vision, or passion, or you name it; And then they face a world that embraces them to work and supports it, a world given by a rich ecosystem that is also vibrant and which comes with call to actions, oriented to action first, and furthermore it is networked. Thus, surely, to think about slowing down, can sound counter productive, as a starter. @meta-refid 2345-9494-9494-4444

This is a book about getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]. Now, and given that the title is *Slow Down to Startup*, there are two levels of discomfort that should be initially addressed. One, to the entrepreneur, the other to the startup. On the side of the entrepreneurs, it is because of the act of doing involves energy like a fire which sets the motion from motivations and aspirations, and more, but nevertheless what happens generally is perceived as the conventional opposite of things like the calmer or the slower movement. For The startup, the discomfort comes from the fact that startup aims to cause impact to the environment, into the world, our world which is now faster, or accelerated, or spinning faster anyway. To elaborate on that, we should pick a startup definition; and a good one which connects with principles aligned with this book is the one given by Paul Graham where startups means growth:

[^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]: The theme of getting things done have sometimes created confusion to me when I thought about innovation and impact. Because I first thought that getting things done for the sake of getting things done may be arbitrary and appears to be about a waste of resources. The view of Schumpeter helped me to be calmer, because he simplified, under the perspective that in a dynamic world of exchanges it appears a necessity for effiency and from comparison among similar ways to get things done people pick more efficient ones. And from that creative new things solves their problems in new ways, as in 10x more effient, this connects with the idea of creative destruction. 

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of "exit." The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.*" (Graham, Paul., 2012)

If I had received that quote in a hand-written letter and nothing more I would need to deal with its essential requirement, and feeling the implied discomfort which sets in, to focus on the point that "the only essential thing is growth." And when writing back to Paul, I would start wondering: Are you saying that the startup, that grows, grows in our world, or in the environment? As in, in ways producing an impact? There are many other business doing business and producing things in the world, they seem to be growing, or accelerating. But I think that you are telling me that I should figure out, or that my startup should figure, how to grow in different way, or more intense way, than these others. I think that when you use the word fast, you're probably saying that. This seems to be so because of that relative movement, because everyone is generally focused on performance, doing what they do in better ways. So you want mine to be outstanding, to raise from the norm. I feel the discomfort because I feel that to do the different I need to also think in different ways.

Anyway, and thankfully, Paul had written a great deal of reflections from the article where I took the quote from, *Startup = Growth* (2012) and other thoughts asking us to slow down or to think different, or to think through, or to be conscious or reflective, also in articles like *Do Things that Don't Scale* (2013) about a decade ago. Now if we take the discomfort aside, as in to not be distracted, and if accept the invitation, we may then consider the missing link (bewteen the founder and the startup,) that essentially the grown only happpens by the growth for the founder that goes in synchronicity with the growth of the startup. This setting also implies that we are interested in the holistic journey. In a way, we are framing a founder-entrepreneur role, that is set to be around, or not expendable [^footnote_not_expendable], which sets the startup entity as one to be around and which evolves and grows and impacts the world, not expendable. 

[^footnote_not_expendable]: This doesn't mean that in real life you can't exit your start-up journey, or that the start-up itself cant exit, for any reason. But the frame, as an assumption, is key for our reflections and takeaways that can help us through actually any entrepreneurial journey of getting things done. 

This initial framing aligns with other considerations that reflects about the dynamics between founders and their startups growing in the world. One in particular is brought by the Blitzscaling framework, brought by Chris Yeh and Reid Hoffman, which considers the challenges of growth by breaking down by stages - family, tribe, village, city and nation. With that structure, again, they're essentially inviting us into the discussion, and reflection, about what it takes to support that holistic journey of growth. As an example, from the Blitzscaling lecture 18 (2015), Brian Chesky from Airbnb (who is a founder that survived through the stages,) characterized the learning challenges - through the stages - as being different from the experience of continuous learning, as in developing skills. For Brian, it's like being required to learn a new sport. We'll come back to Brian's thoughts in further chapters but, for now, if I had to draw what he is saying, I would draw an egg, the larva, the pupa, and the adult, the butterfly.

In other words, the challenge for getting things done can be broken down using perspectives, and some of them can give us different levels of zoom. To view from far, I like the one that Reid Hoffman carries in his pocket: A founder who jumps off a cliff and is trying to assemble an airplane on the way down [^footnote_reidhoffman_cliff]. But if I switch to Brian's goggles, I can then see one who jumps off a cliff, assembles an airplane on the way down, and then if they do it well, they must learn how to fly, and if they go well they have to figure out where to go. 

[^footnote_reidhoffman_cliff]: Reid is known for characterizing the challenging situation of a founder who runs a startup, where essentially "you throw yourself off a cliff and you assemble an airplane on the way down" (Hoffman & Casnocha, 2013). 


<!--
@outline - World has changed 
--> 

This brief analysis gives us a general picture, or a window to consider the challenges for the evolution of the founders as linked with the evolution of the startup, linked with the evolution of the business, and naturally the implications of the business growth into our civilization. That is a situation, we know, and for some it may be a reason for an intervention, or a sort of slapt on the wrist. But that isn't the main reason why I am here. The reason that we are here is because of a debit which we may not be able to solve by usual channels. This debit is a situation that we put ourselves in, by the world that may have changed the nature of getting things done. This debit is given in the face of an abundance of solutions which support us, given by the richer ecosystem of entrepreneurship, in the face of the networked and digitally connected platforms - if I had to put our situation in a nutshell. 

Let us consider what has changed in the world of entrepreneurs, how the situation became a complication, which will help us to see our binding agreement of this reflective journey. 

### The entrepreneurial function 

<!--
@outline - before

If we set our time machine to November 10, 1876, we would witness emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, turning on the massive steam engine at the inauguration of the centennial exhibition of the United States' independence in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. This milestone symbolizes the onset of new era, when the people's clock became faster by likely their attention span shorter. That engine, the Corliss Centennial Engine, became the icon of the exhibition. Standing 14 meters tall and boasting a power of 1400 horse-power, it was responsible for powering the entire exhibition setup, which encompassed more than 200 buildings spread over 5 km in length. (Wikipedia, 2019)

![Illustration of the Corliss Engine, public domain.](images/100/CentennialEngine.png)

According to historian Maury Klein (2008), the exhibition showcased all the modern wonders of the mechanization of the industrial revolution: machines that prepared molds for printing machines, sewing machines, telegraph devices, locomotives, automatic saws, belt presses, winches, scales, excavators, drilling machines, giant sugarcane mills, cotton presses, stone-crushing machines, diamond drills, stone cutters, various tools, agricultural equipment, carriages, tile and brick-making machines, bookbinding machines, paper-making machines, cardboard, machines for making threads, cables, screws, car wheels, train wheels, and so much more. Machines. I know, it might seem too much to name 26 examples - that is antiquated. 

Let me start again, now using our modern-days hot numbers. Think of 200 buildings. Now picture a 45 feet steam engine in comparisonn with a 10-feet basketball rim. And picture emperor Dom Pedro II who were 6-feet tallk like a basketball player. Now since Dom Pedro wasn't into sports, and interested in technological advancements, try to imagine his work to be able to reach out to the buildings through the 3.1 extension of the exhibition. Or we can think of the 10 million visitors who had the chance to see that experience, to be amused by the size and potential impact. These solutions, much of it materialized as mechanical solutions, were fruits of human work and collaboration which produced destruction to a prior economic order, giving birth to new economic models.

@meta @todo
* @todo - p2 ( ) - In Introduction - Check Oliver Evans industry mill data from Maury Klein. @meta-refid 1234-4567-8787-4444
-->

Now, let us zoom in and look at an isolated entrepreneurial movement which had impacted the world; to consider the rise of the flour mill industry in U.S. in contrast with the work of American inventor Oliver Evans. We will go back 100 years. Evan's automatic mill was an innovation. It eliminated numerous hours of manual work and reduced the risk of contamination. The design of his mill system was promoted as able to be operated by just one person, put the grain here, pick flour there. Evans affected the economic dynamics and people's needs. His design, materialized through mill systems in US, improved the distribution of the higher quality flour to people, improved the conditions to stock the product with quality, and impacted in cheaper prices. Those are some of the considerations for consumers.

![Oliver Evans' automatic mill, which is in the public domain, was made by James Poupard and documented in the work titled "The Young Mill-Wright & Miller's Guide."](images/100/Oliver_Evans_-_Automated_mill.jpg)




On the side of the evolving industry, many implementors had used Evan's designs and had created their mills. This wasn't good news for Oliver and for good or bad he actually didn't see the whole industry that followed highly influenced by his design. In a way we can see Evans as one which were busy with the invention side. He had patents, as an example U.S. patent number 3 was granted to him, and wanted to be involved, but even back in the days that brought to him a hell. But from the view of the entrepreneurial function, the holistic movement of getting things done, his ideas flourished. It supported the general growth movement for the whole flour industry. Evans spinned the world, minimally the flour milling world, in high-pressure or faster ways, you name it. His work set a new order which supported the death of an existing order [^footnote_manual_labor_enslaved_civil]. 

This set us to consider the holistic view of this single invention, and the unfolded whole entrepreneurial function which followed, which in many ways supports the characterization of the process known as *Creative Destruction* [^footnote_creativedestruction]. I have simplified the process which Oliver didn't see, from his living days in the field anyway, as the world were slow. 

[^footnote_creativedestruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development.

[^footnote_manual_labor_enslaved_civil]: Oliver had lived from 1755 and 1819, and the United States declared independence in 1776 when Oliver were 21. "The Young Mill-Wright and Miller's Guide" came about in 1795, when he was 40, so he was set to promote it. These were pre-civil war days of increasing industrialization. 






### Can the environment influence?




<!--
@outline - question 
--> 


Now, and fast forward to our days, or back to the future of our entrepreneurial challenges, and the given growth challenges, there is a clear distinction given that things happens faster and we are being call to get involved with the whole holistic function. Thus, to conider the getting things done not only the inventive parts but too the parts where we get involved with the means to innovate in the market. That growth, through all these stages, goes along with the shorter timeframe where potential for impact is present. 

Now, here's where things start to get more complicated for us because the abundance of solutions, as in building blocks, are not only applicable as tools for one part, like the inventive or the inventor's moment. In fact, these building blocks are a given and support us throughout the whole process. In other words, and we are too celebrating the good news, we have tools for trying to come up with the idea, tools for validating what we do with the environment, tools for deciding, tools for growing, for all the stages. And we know too that all these things comes with good intentions. To point an intent, the Blitzscaling movement does not ask us to be the first to grow, to conquer, it asks us to be the one who lasts. Yet, and going back to the debit, all these tools can be used, or misused; and we can be busy, and miss the view of purpose. 


<!--
@outline - Question
--> 


Exactly because the very methods of innovating by using methods are both applicable in the startup space and the corporate space because they compete in the end of the day, this situation may then help us to set and prompt a question before us. In other words, does the environment given by data or knowledge and tools and methods for deciding causes pressures or influence our movement of getting things done in somewhat controlled ways or induced decision-making ways? as in in ways clouding our views? Or to not to be involved, or to be less involved anyway, with breaking the rules of the environment? And furthermore, to be involved in what appears to be "breaking the rules" of the environment but doing so in synergistic ways given by the very rich environment? To support this, we may consider a thought from Maslow in *Toward the Psychology of Being*:

> *"The danger that I see is the resurgence, in new and more sophisticated forms, of the old identification of psychological health with adjustment, adjustment to reality, adjustment to society, adjustment to other people. That is, the authentic or healthy person may be defined not in his own right, not in his autonomy, not by his own intra-psychic and non-environmental laws, not as *different* from the environment, independent of it or opposed to it, but rather in environment-centered terms, e.g., of ability to master the environment, to be capable, adequate, effective, competent in relation to it, to do a good job, to perceive it well, to be in good relations to it, to be successful in its terms. To say it in another way, the job-analysis, the requirements of the task, should not be the major criterion of worth or health of the individual. There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

So here I set a potential question, I wonder, if our  environment, how giving us building blocks for decisions through all the stages, could cause an impact influencing our movement in terms of what we do, how we do, and even why we do. Or could our environment take our attention in ways that we get to be overly busy dealing with these building blocks to the e point of distracting from what we're actually doing?

And if you dig, it is quite rational as we must agree that we now have much more data, more stories, more references, more tools, more means of interaction, more for growth, and even more.

Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life." > (Andreessen, 2023)" @meta-refid 1222-3334-8884-9999
-->

Maslow thinking is not only a worth reflection but actually has here for us to support the characterization of this book. In other words, we are here to reflect about the psychology of the founder, or toward the psychology of the entrepreneur, such as to be thougtful about in which ways our beings get to grow or become defensive by the dynamics of this environment; and along to reflect about the consequences in terms of the well-being of our organizations with we know have direct implications in the well-being of our whole civilization. Maslow's consideration, these potential worries from early 1960s, is a prompt. It prompts us, to wonder, how this rich world solutions define us and define entrepreneurship, in, indeed, perhaps sophisticated forms. 











### We have the data 


<!--

* outline - introduction, answer 1 - situation of data and information improving - feat. Peter Drucker of data  
--> 



Now, and since the prompt is from 1960, if I thought of myself as being a sort of AI robot, or tool, to give the answer, I would seem reasonable to hear what experienced or renowned leaders in management had considered about the corporate world transformations in the face of decisions tied with a richer system of information, or data, or tools, or methods. 

Let us start with data. The former CEO of Intel, Angy Grove, in *Arguing with Data*, warned [^footnote_andygrove_fastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people entered into a thiking where they should argue their debates with data right in hand. In alignment with Andy's observations and reflections, Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, is known for his concern helping management in general to be aware and conscious that people lie with data and that they don't do so because of necessary evil of intention, but in part to please audiences [^footnote_jeff_lie_data], which may be inferred and it's clearly observed that it's part of a phenomenon where we're essentially being both controllers or controlled by the very presence of data.

<!--

[^footnote_andygrove_fastdata]: In Andy Grove's book, *Only the Paranoid Survive*, the quoted phrase in English reads, “Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It’s good advice. All too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis.” The warning applies to what he termed a "Strategic Inflection Point," situations so adverse and unexpected that they befuddle companies. Intel survived crises of this magnitude and later also became a leading player. In these situations, the anticipatory data can be misleading.

If an objection din't cross your mind, I'll throw the stone and say to "hold your horses! are you telling me that more data and more information, as in passively available, does worse than no information at all and managing with guesses?" Maybe yes, maybe no. No, because they recognize data. Yes because they point that we are arguing with emotions. Certainly there's no evil in passive data and knowledge available. But we are considering that there's something in us, from our willingness to use it and to engage with it, that might actually take us into that space of confusion - one which we may not even see as in when we become followers of a passive-aggressive movement. In *Technology, Management, and Society*, Peter Drucker has contextualized a situation where information abundance does impact effective communication, which he highlights defining it as the kind of communication where the receiver actually understands and collaborates, as opposed to passive acceptance of the message:

> *"More and better information does not solve the communication problem, nor does it bridge the communication gap. On the contrary, the more information the greater is the need for functioning and effective communication becomes. The more information available, in other words, the greater is the communications gap likely to be. The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and application, that is, on communications. In the second place, the more effective the information process, the more impersonal and formal will it become, the more will it separate human beings and thereby require separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the human relationships, the relationship of communication. It may be said that the effectiveness of the information process will depend increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of effective communication - that is, in the present situation - the information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can produce is data."*

Peter Drucker were preparing us to creating consciousness in the face of an actual rise of elements which appears as information and the intrinsic disconnect from context; or as he pointed, impersonal or formal. This should prompt us to consider our ability to operate by decisions tied with the environment; and in special to reflect about the tools and systems that we have created throughout these years, tools for dealing with data, for pulling data, for querying data, for analyzing data, or dispatching data. Now, Peter and Andy had certainly seen and tasted a bit of that world but I don't think they experienced the whole enchilada. For now, it's been a while that we are acquainted with tools for dealing with data, like the tools to pull data or tools to dispatch data. And because data is valued, or that we value things through data, these tools become valuable by induction; like a shovel that is seen as value because it is know for its potential efficiency to dig, as in to find gold if we dig in history. Similarly, why to send an individual email if one can send a million at once? Why to pull and pick data by hand data if one can deal with millions of records? Thus, comparatively, there's certainly pain or latent need for these tools given that the others, like the competition, might be using them for doing it. From that it comes too a need for seeking assistance to access and use these things. Thus, in order to understand its meaning before decisions, we go to the experts, the people that know how to use these tools, which are certainly, generally, people that are passionate about technologies and tools. In other words, there's a programmer, or an expert in data, or an engineer who calculates quickly by operating a special kind of calculator. He or she who knows knows how to manipulate, thus they become important, and then in a way gatekeepers for tools. Moreover, they are incentivized and seen as valuable by the simple fact they manipulate the data. On an extreme point of view, we incentivize them to get busy with these tools and skills, also because these tools are being developed very fast and they gotta keep up to it, mostly up to date with the latest tools or trends. And with that, they might be less involved in looking from above, or to bother to check the contrarian view, or to consider the view of purpose, or to see things from perspective. In other words, not that they're comfortable with tools, but they're busy with looking at the tools methods of using and its evolution. Certainly, their tools are not arbitrary. Thus, in a way or another, these tools will always get better even if many of them are getting there by trial and error. This circles back to a possibility of an induced movement by communication where characterized perceptions of experts adds value to support decisions, which may in fact reduce people as becoming tools themselves.  That our tools, and systems, brought to us efficiency in terms of manipulating data, we know. Moreover that the abundance of these building blocks can be quite meaningful in the right moment in time, as in that under the abundance it is possible to find good data that becomes good reasons for the narratives of decision-making in the collaborative environment-based communication. In other words, data captivate us because they may be so well ready in the right context and time. By induction, we follow, as we know that the right data in the right time supports a good narrative - we have seen it working. Thus, when the stars align, we may be teased to decide.






























### We can learn 

<!--
* @outline - Complication - The getting things done implies in specialized movement first, and it feels great. And that sets the complication of change, as comparative analysis. Although ambitions for entrepreneurial action is widespread, the outcomes as in to innovate, are driven by execution first; tied to the environment. Which seems not in alignment with entrepreneurial action which refuses the environment. Corporations, specialists, expenddable, Guacamole, means lower investment in training. But effects of new training are coming in other ways, through methods that does the job of the learning. We are not required to evolve ourselves.  
-->

<!--

* @outline - complication - Learning for innovcation into the machine.  #BAU

Now, by this brief observation of the abundance we can surely be very busy in a world which invites us to do it by getting things done, first. Nevertheless, this world of execution - yet unfair to call it a land of confusion - is known as one where management of the entrepreneurial consists of evaluating these movements, by internal or external interactions, against achieving the goals. This is why, and again, we should be thankful for our intrinsic human trait, our ability to learn. But more than that, to celebrate that learning how to learn is actually what sets in as a challenge. And which can be the actual escape hat from the potential traps of us falling into that inducement movement in a space that may at times seem to be to not bring about an actual ground approaching us. It may be unfair to say that that fall can sometimes look like an infinite space where we can warp. But certainly there are some observable elements that we can take our focus away and burn too many resources into that movement. And moreover, to impact the well-being of ourselves in ways that can cause an inability to reconciliate the growth of all the entities we have considered.

In this context, learning, we consider how the world of work, or the corporate world, has improved, and is evolving in terms of ways where learning is carried over by the machine. Considering the spending in training in comparison with other execution investments. In the 2018, in a summit entitled *The Future of Talent - Transcending Work*, (Global Silicon Valley, 2018) Rob Biederman, the then CEO of Catalant Technologies, highlighted an intriguing aspect of corporate spending priorities, pointing that a large company which likely the audience were shareholders, allocates less budget per employee on training than his own startup spends on avocados. That view can certainly show part of the problem, although we cannot infer that learning equals to training since the the other, the side of execution, isn't about an execution that doesn't care about innovation or doesn't care about learning. That is not the case, the world has revolved there too. As an example, we should consider the many processes and that businesses are essentially using to innovate, certainly pushed by many factors such as the competitive forces which in more richer ways innovates with higher dynamics with users or customers, minimally. Along with that, we can clearly observe the many methods, positioned as building blocks to solve aspirational goals and innovate, to set the context we can think of the reach of methods like design thinking or lean methods into the corporate world [^footnote_lean_corporate]. In other words, our businesses welcome innovation, they want to innovate, while they do so by creating a normal work routine which certainly carry ties with the control organization that is in need to organize and attempt to execute all of that as normal work. It may be unfair to say that corporations are trying to innovate by doing business as usual, or to think that the creative brain of corporations are somewhat controlled, not to say mechanized or automated. On the other hand, if it were possible, corporations would seriously consider to automate it. If that is a problem, or not, for some organizations, we might take that aside for now and come back to how this circles back to us.

[^footnote_lean_corporate]: Both Steve Blank and Eric Ries, founders or fathers of the Lean Startup Movement, have accepted or embraced, in part, the challenge of or the requests of the corporate world that also wanted to innovate likely in the face of being out-competed by users themselves (by their startups.)

Now that the grown-up world is interconnected with the young (and hopeful inventive world) we know, so let us go back to our situation and wonder if that data and knowledge and information and tools are essentially in fact entering the space of entrepreneurs and their startup situations. And moreover, more than that and beyond the benefits of that which are widely addressed by now, to wonder if decision-making is actually induced by methods and the implications of using them. In this context, we may being again the father of the lean movement, and some observations from Steve Blank, one in particular which he addressed as a fundamental issue with startups since 2014. His vision, which connects with fundamental motivations to the whole movement, was that entrepreneurs think that their startups are smaller versions of large companies. Since then, Steve kept alert, and conscious, about that problem of a phenomenon. He kept on, reminding them, that startups are not smaller versions of large companies. He kept reminding them that they essentially are in the discovery phase. Discovery phase, that is one take away and it's clear from the beginnings. By now, a decade later, the lean movement have matured and is widely used by founders, and teams and startups, and also by corporations trying to innovate. We have a great deal of conversations, and reflections, about the potential uses and misuses of these methods. And certainly interesting considerations of the phenomenon from widespread use and the potentiality of the controller who - perhaps by the urge to get things done - enters the space of using this methods in ways aligned with the considerations from Andy Grove - of people arguing with data - and the reflections from Jeff Bezos' concern about people using data to please, which we may too consider the extremme of lying with data, although without intent. In fact, within the realm of lean, this is observable and discussed by these fathers of lean, such as the extreme which can be see as founders talking about using lean but not using, as in procrastinating with lean, or being enamorated with the process, and there are other ways to see that, but in general shows the pattern of founders involved in missing the view of purpose [^footnote_ericries_purpose].

[^footnote_ericries_purpose]: Eric Ries, the renowned author of *The Lean Start-Up* and *The Start-up Way* carries his concern with the situation when the view of purpose is lost even in organizations that can use the lean methods professionally. 







### And we are not alone 




To reflect on these possibilities we need to address characterizations of the entrepreneur's start, the implied aspirational intent for something new, and how they move by using the environment characterized by the wider and richer ecosystem. Specifically to the situation of founders, we must recognize that founders start from a lonely place. This idea was expressed a decade ago in *Founder Depression* (2014) by Sam Altman who is today widely known as the CEO of OpenAI: 

> *"Founders end up with a lot of weight on their shoulders—their employees and their families, their customers, their investors, etc.  Founders usually feel a responsibility to make everyone happy, even though interests are often opposed. And it’s lonely in a way that’s difficult to explain, even with a cofounder (one of the things that works about organizations like Y Combinator is that you have a peer group you can lean on for support)."* (Altman, Sam., 2014)

There are other characterizations of that idea. One in particular, again given by Brian Chesk from that Blitzscaling lecture 18, tell us that "all these really good ideas or big ideas often sound like stupid ideas," and that we should not worry about anyone stealing our ideas because "if it's any good, everyone will dismiss it." Again, alone.

@note 
* Quote - And, of course it turned out that the crazy little idea that we thought no one else would do, became the big idea. And I think there were a couple lessons there. Number one, all these really good ideas or big ideas often sound like stupid ideas. Somebody once told me in the early days, don't worry about anyone stealing your idea. If it's any good, everyone will dismiss it.

Now, as we picture this lonely birthplace, or birth space, we shall then consider a welcoming setting where they can exercise, or execute, their function. This is now a richer environment which can be thought of an incubation ecosystem. In other words, founders are more generally using the same methods given by the richer ecosystem characterized social interactions of supporting networks. Therefore, we may have baby founders, trying to come out, by interacting or iterating with an outter world of entities, like practitioners, advisors, experts, and you name it. Furthermore, they see other founders doing the same. in other words, and to be fair, these characterizations of the rich startup ecosystem, or a social space of incubation, gives us warmth and it's involving. This is so because they care, because they're not indifferent. In other words, we're not alone. When I look at the situation, I see that this rich incubation system give us superpowers, but I also see that no superpower is as powerful as being able to rise into the world by not being alone.

But then again, more than the tools and methods and that welcoming space, I see something new, that they narratives are better, are evolving, or involving. Their stories are coherent to my ears. So then again, back to our challenges, it's still quite challenging because we are challenged to be aware by the day and by the hour, about our movements through this space, or through these networks. If I go back and remix Reid's scene, I see now a space and that same one who jumps off a cliff but now on her way down finds lots of things in the air like hammers and shovels and voices and hearts and claps and white boards and avocados, and other interesting that didn't exist back in the days of the Industrial Revolution. Like platforms. This different thing don't seem to be falling along. I see a carrier, fully equipped. I see a nice road, waiting for me, to land my start up ship, waiting for me to take off. But we know, there's a truth in there, and it's coherently given by so many of them platforms which are actually real. Comee one, they are really our ways to take off. So that's how the abundant world looks for founders which may be unfair to say that it's enchanting, or evil, but it is fair to consider that it's complex and can be confusing because we're going to feel embraced. By so many options, now with amazing narratives, with coherence, and actually in fact very good reasons for using for deciding.

### Where we are going we don't need roads 




Now, we come up with some characterizations of consequences but just to structure a problem, in two levels, the potential extreme of us being trapped and too involved - like data, tools and methods and hugs or parties - influencing our decisions, as in taking us to close gaps no matter what gaps, seeking validation for the sake of validation, or valuing methods that can validate, or an extreme as a way to keep the equilibrium that we are advancing, thus inducing us into becoming a specialist as in a specialized generalist. This extreme by the superpowers may set one to feel as certainly powerful, or becoming powerful, and with that powerfully dangerous. But on the other level we may see an actual intermediary situation, perhaps more realistic, where are can be too involved in using our energy, our creative energy by navigating the space by trial and error, certainly supported by the effiency of this medium, but to the point it may could us to overfocus, or to take our attention away, such as from the view of perspective or purpose, which can take us to become movers by learning in retrospect, such as by post-mortem analysis, if not using methods for analysis that may not even characterize some of the fundamental ideas of post-mortem which involves releasing what you know. As we move on into reflections in this direction, I invite us to pause briefly to provoke ourselves with another question: Would it be the case that a way of doing entrepreneurship - as in business as usual - may affect our intrinsic element of entrepreneurship, or the founder, or of an artist, our ability to see through? Or, with the lenses from Blitzscaling, are we engaged with learning how to learn? And aware that our ways to learn how to learn could be just learning as in a directed movement?

As we proceed, the three parts that follows brings about some situation, complications, and considerations to bring about our reflections, as an opportunity to think through about who we are when we enter this journey. ourselves, about our own movements; thus to recover characterizations from the entrepreneurial spirit to support us to go against normal craziness of work [^basecampcrazy], minimally, or call it the frenetic or the fast-paced ways, which indeed might be to some extent connected with us not facing, honestly, the reality, and the scary situation which may set us to be defensive - such as defensivelly doing it as in performing. Running the risk of committing a fault in the world of writers and quoting back part of the quote I just quoted before, I ask us to think again about an idea, to consider the psychology of the founder who indeed has to listen to the outer but should never give up listening to the inner too: 

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried and Hansson are the founders of Basecamp, a well-known company from Silicon Valley, in "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," argue that it is necessary to work against the industry's toxic instincts and norms that avoids the possibility of managing a company calmly. The expression "It's crazy at work" is used by them to describe a work environment where pressure, such as excessive working hours, and consequences like anxiety, are the norm; and they reject this idea in favor of a calmer and more balanced work environment.

> *"There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

In part one, through *Urgency of the Self*, to support our conscious attitude for the road ahead, the road of growth of the startup which we assume that can only be achieved by self growth under the tenet that we are not expendable, that we value our beings and that who we are as entrepreneurs matches who we are as human beings - that everyone is an entrepreneur and that the role developed by entrepreneurship is not an indentity that is used for a business which is separated from us as a whole. We look at who we are, we value who we are, so that we can respect ourselves through the navigation that may set us into traps, into a disconnect. Through this part we go from key elements of who we are and straightly reflecting about our situation in the middle of the environment, through the inclination for running, through the journey of impact. Above all, we check on ourselves rather than to look for the external. Although the startup journey can't be controlled, our invest relies in observations and reflections about us doing it in ways that are less frustrating, less confusing, less arbitrary, and more fruitful, minimally in terms of the being conscious about our best selves which is key for the road ahead.

Through the second part, *Urgency of the Team*, we extent our reflections to improve the health of the team dynamics as it improve its collaboration. We start by considering how the urgent rises from execution and the challenging space this creates for keep the conscious view of purpose, such as how we start to fail with our entrepreneurial characterizations and entrepreneurship well-being causing the entrepreneurial function to lag behind, or be obfuscated by the movement of progress. We give special consideration for the dynamics that are given by applicability of lean movements and how teams generally think they are advancing but actually building up a great level of disconnection from their purpose. We wrap this part by valuing communication not as a communication serving the purpose of goals, like a tool, but a view for communication that serves for the growing the team in the first place. 

<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - introduction - part  - systems  
--> 

We complete the book through *Urgency in the system*, considering general elements that affects teams organization-wide ways. We recognize that the growth up and productive state of an organization demands a goal system that needs to be efficient. To that, we ask of our goal management efforts to being flexible, to be conscious, to be honest. As a final reflection, we will consider the beautiful and powerful world of narratives that involves celebrating how we get to do amazing things quick - such as to pull effort from humans - but too why to never do it without being conscious and aware of the dynamics of how our narrative systems influences control in ways we are not aware - given by voices through platforms, networks, systems, tools, technologies - by its own inherantly powerful characterizations if we assume ourselves as Homom narrans.

So we if go back to what this book is about, and think about that crossroad, what appears to be right, the right ways known to us, we are in fact exercising our ability not to just take the other, but to put that crossroad right there; because we know, that in this journey we are hungry, for the breakfast; and when we enter that all-you-can-eat buffet, or a hypermarket solutions, we will surely feel empowered to pick things we want and perhaps the things we don't need. In the real world of us doers, we know, it's tough; as the problem goes back to what is the actual honest communication or how to learn how to learn; exactly because under the abundance of data and tools and methods for deciding there is certainly something that appears to be the right thing at the right moment, as in when the thing available becomes good data and good reasons that supports decisions. Our moment as for us to be conscious about effects of a movement which may be about procrastination disguised as entrepreneurial action, that looks like getting things done. Then asks for courage to use time, to balance our views, to give us permission to work in what matters beyond what appears to be what matters. It takes courage to engage in an exercise to check what appears to be productivity. It takes permission to see through, through new goggles, to believe that something great can be achieved by not being a controller. And it takes self-respect because entrepreneurship recognizes that the doer for any next challenge appears to be young, or innocent, and not characterized by the known know-it-all of the prior stage. This works for the inexperienced founders, sure; but too the experienced founders, or leaders, who are too quite interested in reflections abotu the ways for them to release from their know-it-all views in the face of challenges especially the ones which will set them to be young again, then fearful. So let us do it, to engage with that, as part of work.
