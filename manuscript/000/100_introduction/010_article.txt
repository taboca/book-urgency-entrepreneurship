@outline - getting things done and growth, the relationship with the environment.
--> 


This is a book about getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]. Now I know that this is a pretty strong statement for a book entitled *Slow Down to Start Up*. On top of that I, also feel that this is a book about the fastest way to get things done, specifically for founders and their start-ups. When I wrote this other statement, I almost took it back. But I had calmed down when I thought that there are ways to achieve results faster which are the ways where getting things done involves a) winning bets - as in by gambling - or b) by capturing value directly without bothering to know how to make value. In a simplified view, success, or impact, can be created or taken. 

[^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]: The theme of getting things done have sometimes created confusion to me when I thought about innovation and impact. Because I first thought that getting things done for the sake of getting things done may be arbitrary and appears to be about a waste of resources. The view of Schumpeter helped me to be calmer, because he simplified, under the perspective that in a dynamic world of exchanges it appears a necessity for effiency and from comparison among similar ways to get things done people pick more efficient ones. And from that creative new things solves their problems in new ways, as in 10x more effient, this connects with the idea of creative destruction. 

Now if that is a crossroad, I am inviting you to take a left, right there. This one is the road to making things happen, as opposed to take the other, the one that appears to be right, or faster, or closer. Indeed ours appear longer but it does carry a great value. This value also defines our relationship and as sets a requirement to our road ahead. Founders are not expendable. So if I wanted you to be around, not only through this reading but through the path of your start-up, is not enough; the other good reason is that by valuing the most precious resource and requiring us to be around, we are in it implicitly make a culture that does not think of its resources as expendable which turns out in alignment with making as taking involves a less conscious movement in alignment with take your chances while making sets us into a conscious movement in alighment with the necessity not only to learn but to growth. Thus this a book about founders, on their way to get things done, doing it through their startups, in ways that they are around.

Now this bring us to consider the definition of the startup. Our startup characterization is of an entity that is in it for growth, to grow, in alignment with the thought that startup equals to growth [^foonote_paulgraham_startup_growth]. From this perspective, we will have to lock in that the startup is in an evolutionary path. In mean, an entity that is formed, that starts with an idea or thoughts of purpose. And then, it changes which it materializes something - as a product or a service or as a functional entity - and this materialization happens to produce interactions with the environment, offering value and establishing an exchange, and then by that it may capture value, as a consequence of the dynamics with this external environment - the world or the market or audiences - value that may make the conditions for greater growth. 

[^foonote_paulgraham_startup_growth]: Paul Graham's definition of startup equals to growth is used here, although to do it fast might confuse me, on what that means; while I become calmer when I think that essentially the fast means the more conscious way of growing before others.

@outline - situation of founders in the world 
--> 

Therefore, this a book about us on our ways to get things done by running a startup and interested in us to be around while taking our startup into the path of growth through evolving. A key take away when we set us there is that we are too required to grow and to evolve. And here is where our challenge gets warner, a challenge that may take tease us to take that other road, the road that appears to be right, the road that appears to be faster, or closer. 















### Slow down and hurry up 




<!-- 
@meta @Outline
### Punchline - 

- Slowing down feels bad, while the urge to hurry up and run feels better.
- Slowing down is associated with uncertainty, whereas running feels connected with certainty.
- The new language of "hurry up" or "run" is reinforced by digital signals like claps, likes, and votes in collaborative environments.
- Founder struggle, being right. 

@outline
### 2. Impact on Founders

- Founders are driven to pursue small grains of success obsessively.
- This obsession can lead to missing larger opportunities.
  - Small successes may not align with the external environment and desired outcomes.
  - Reduced attention spans, reduced level of calmess, leads to becoming specialists, seeking to be right, and professionals, but missing broader opportunities.
- Moreover, eergy is wasted by focusing on misleading goals, preventing greater achievements.

When an incidental voice says "let's slow down," in a modern-world workplace, it doesn't sound great. If the team pauses, they might wonder "why is it that we can't keep doing what we were doing?" On the other hand, the "let's speed up," sounds more plausible, although modern-world variations of "keep cranking" are not noisy and given by the smooth beat of digitalized thumbs ups and claps by the hour. And that makes sense, doesn't it? That is how we keep the beat, how we sum our efforts, especially in the corporate situation that follows a somehow coherent movement that things are working, even when things aren’t. That goes with closing the gap, getting things done earlier, selling more, delivering faster, all things that in a way or another follows the wider rhythm of the competition, more or less eloquently or more or less mediocre.

The complication, on the other hand and in the heads of entrepreneurs, happens to be that thoughts of slowing down are generally felt as frustrating. In other words, it does not matter - this happens: That when we are caught opening the gap, and not getting things done sooner or selling less or delivering slower, and the like, we just don’t like it. And this is so because we are caught by that uncomfortable feeling. Now, we do know that founders or innovators have to be resilient, that they are aware of a world of uncertainty, that they need to be prepared for what does not look productive, or prepared to be wrong, initially certainly but as well throughout the growth path. And we know too, to be fair, that for many of them entrepreneurs that fear of failure, maybe a raw fear, does work as a kind of fear that drives growth, that takes them to move mountains.

But what we may not know, or feel, or fail to notice, is a feeling that happens on a by-the-hour basis, or real-time, now something that we might be quite used to. That feeling of sadness, into ourselves, into the self, felt grain by grain, to subtitle anyway to be noted. But apparent anyway from our needs to be constantly monitoring, constantly seeking to grab, constantly seeking validation. One which may materialize an inner system, a certain operating system of management; again perhaps fueled or teased or mirrored by that outer operating system of getting things done, the one that wants to feel great by those great things, the one which welcomes productivity; as in, as soon as possible.

But here we are worried, to our lives as founders and entrepreneurs of ourselves, living our own journeys, that that normal movement for grabbing what feels productive is not enough to bring out the great, for us, for the startup, and for the long term business, and for society. As for what we do out there, bargains rise as outcomes. For startups? They may pivot quickly into the first thing that seems to work. Some of them then fail and simply don't get why some weird competitor does it better. For the big corporations? It dies, by not having a way to change, or they acquire others to delay or in an attempt to import some new characterization of change. And for their leaders, they rather be replaced than to be seen as babies again.

But to ourselves, we can’t see what we pay for ourselves, running our projects or startups or our own lives like that. That we are too involved - by now - with that mechanized way of looking at life - constantly dispensing our attention, our focus, to that other part of the equation, welcoming greatness, even little great grains, grain by grain. As in, by the hour, or by the minute, and obsessively. But more than that, we can’t see that by that grain-by-grain movement we are taking us into a condition of saturation and missing living our journeys in ways connected with fundamental values. And by living that we too get, grain by grain, disconnected from our true potential.

### 3. Situational Alert

- The general language of action, in life and corporate world suggests using humans as expendable resources.
  - Example: High spending on guacamole (positive experience) vs. low spending on training (boring but necessary).
- Founders cannot replace themselves and must take care not to see themselves as expendable.
- For us all, and founders too, retrospective fixing our actions are costly and should be avoided.

### It's fun to work and do it right 



Should we blame our corporate world, as the producers of that specialist spirit which prevent us from embracing that generalist mindset when we need it? I don’t think so, in fact it’s all around. Our office space just happens to carry on a characterization. There seems to be something, Mechanized or Specialized, that grows in us. A strength that sticks with us. And one too that take us to fear, so badly or cryptic, the idea of slowing down.

Something about that we seem to know. It may be observable in our educated world as we know it, certainly in our work spaces, in our families, and inside of us. Deep inside, we know it, somewhere from our regressions — the size of that monumental investment we took before that great walking far from the leg of our mother. And how it felt after we went back to her hugging and lovely smile. We went through our first exit, successfully. From that, we like it or not, we carried too that other knowing. The knowing about what it takes, that other monumental thing we need (from us or someone else,) before we do that other new thing ahead of us, that new movement. This may be the will to stick, if you will.

But a bit different from our parents who were trying to balance their part policeman and part therapist roles, the corporate world, policies if you will, might have added some fun to the whole thing. In particular, focusing on the “just do it” or “keep walking” element. Because “it’s fun to work,” isn’t it? Well, maybe not in all office spaces but certainly there is one that looks like an amusement park somewhere. Somewhere, remotely or closer to you, there is a modern bridge made of soda cans, now digitally mastered. There their builders can digitally scan their daily intake of cans and they can then see their own monster effort, in real-time, a reflection of their ability to build. This is much better than vanity metrics, they know. Because they can see effort, not prizes. So it’s honest, to some extent, and it is fun, and it is colorful, and the bridge looks like a rainbow.

A slight complication of this fun-to-work office space is that some new complications can’t be just brought up. For complaints, for things not so fun, it may not be too fun if you don’t know how to do it. If an arbitrary crying voice escapes through the hallways, he or she may get a ‘whiner’ flair on her jacket. But that is not a flair too big, nor meant to hurt. It’s one that is colorful, one that to some extent is fun to wear, to get one of those. Through that, we may have invented some humanized ways to do these relations that does the function of equalizing the situation. And it does avoid big trouble, we know it, it prevents the whole bridge falling apart by silencing the potential networked echoes of that cry. And of course, it’s humanized too in other ways because it knows some of the therapeutic tricks and it’s principled to just enough silence the cry but not enough to silence the spirit. In other words, it never loses the warrior, it never goes gray.

In other words, if a few heads say that too many men or too many people are making too many problems, from somewhere it comes, up in the sky, a supermanager wearing his red shirt with a big yellow M and the cape is for embracing all of them whiners, pronto. He is there to offer a hand made of steel, a helping hand, one that pours just enough rain on their blowing parade but not enough to cloud their horizon from that view, that rainbow, that fun-to-work office. This is how equilibrium is dispensed in this great-to-work space. It does so by serving the spirits and by setting us to keep walking with these special shoes that just do it.

I don’t think that our corporate world had invented Doing it or took us into the walking, being specialists, and into fears of being generalists. Perhaps the corporate Machine just added more toppings to that good ice cream.

But in perspective, if any of that language of action exists, it might do so as a result of an passive-aggressive work environment that favors a situation that leans heavily on extracting effort from humans. Althought guacamole could be evidently present [^footnote_guacamole_traning] in some of the best working places, it is arguably unfair to celebrate the exagerations given by these illustrations such as the implied idea that an action-oriented style of management, as opposed to real management, is the main beast we should fear. But the truth that I am after - throughout my attempt to turn what appears to be fun into bitterness - lies in considering the dangers of our inclination, as humans, to when we turn to become entrepreneurs and grab the wheel. When we operate the early stage with the same kinds of movements of the accelerated or productive world as we know it, as in to pursue the end no matter the means. Not a truth sought by the modern worker that operates  a mechanical equipment that put the life of their colleagues at risk, but in the sense of an entrepreneur that enters into entrepreneurship as if it is a car and suddently focuses on the road ahead, and feels that the equipment is there to accelerate into the destination, and by doing so denies to invest in developing consciousness for its behaviors, such as the management of entrepreneurship. 

[^footnote_guacamole_traning]: In the 2018 ASU GSV Summit during the Main Stage Panel titled "The Future of Talent -- Transcending Work," Rob Biederman, Co-Founder and CEO of Catalant Technologies, highlighted an intriguing aspect of corporate spending priorities. He pointed out that a large company which likely the audience were shareholders, allocates less budget per employee on training than his own startup spends on avocados. This remark emphasizes the disparity in investment priorities, particularly in training and education, compared to seemingly trivial expenses like avocados (Global Silicon Valley, 2018) expect that it may not be trivial in the sense of keeping the train moving as it is.

Because despite the turbulence and potential confusion, we have so much more information and tools of unquestionable quality in front of us, more accessible and cheaper. This should be a factor that promotes an optimistic view, for better chances. And if you dig, it is quite rational as we must agree that we now have much more data, more stories, more references, more tools, more means of interaction, more for growth, and even more. In this regard, we should consider the optimistic view from A16Z, the renowned top-tier venture capital firm from Silicon Valley, for where we are going: > "We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life." > (Andreessen, 2023)" @meta-refid 1222-3334-8884-9999
-->




To put in perspective, in the light of our strategy throught the book, the recognition of that language of action - particularly illustrated in the corporate sphere - is a starting point so that we can consider what we do, how we do, and what we do, is a movement that is driven. As an example, consider that our propensity to drive by key results, such as seeking key results connected with outcomes, rises from the individual which makes it synergentically projected in the collaborative situations of work. 









<!--
@outline - note - abstract, recognition of good

And this situation, which is undeniably good - and that is the problem - actually sets a challenge ahead of entrepreneurs, such as if you consider that an arbitrary entrepreneur might not see an inferno ahead, a so clear reason to free the world, and more importantly to the context of our book, so clear reason to execute entrepreneurship differently. In other words, if we are running along, or rolling, in the pace of the corporate sphere, anb in the pace of the urgent and networked world, we may have no reasons to break through, to think through, to break the norm, to break the speed, to break automatic responses, and so on. And this becomes a major complication for us, entrepreneurs or anyone that cares about them, and anyone who cares about humanity, because the environment of our success gives the means, such as an inclusive, or easy, or cheap, or acessible, of supporting an arbitraty entrepreneur such as one in a hurry, to just jump into actions, as if they had a "Jump to Conclusions Mat" where they can jump to.

Therefore, I rather go back to situation oof the hand brake, assuming that we left the cockpit for a while; so then to reaffirm that invitation for us to take another turn, to consider that our need for speed drives us into a land of confusion, and that this mode of doing is harming work in general, that harms us as entrepreneurs, that harms us as human beings, therefore the development of humanity.

> *"The danger that I see is the resurgence, in new and more sophisticated forms, of the old identification of psychological health with adjustment, adjustment to reality, adjustment to society, adjustment to other people. That is, the authentic or healthy person may be defined not in his own right, not in his autonomy, not by his own intra-psychic and non-environmental laws, not as *different* from the environment, independent of it or opposed to it, but rather in environment-centered terms, e.g., of ability to master the environment, to be capable, adequate, effective, competent in relation to it, to do a good job, to perceive it well, to be in good relations to it, to be successful in its terms. To say it in another way, the job-analysis, the requirements of the task, should not be the major criterion of worth or health of the individual. There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

Thus the focus area in our book comes down to reflecting on this accelerated pace that entrepreneurs might fit and how it impacts everything precisely at in the moment that we need energy, like willpower, and good ideas, and the right conditions to move on and achieve growth as individuals and for our organizations. What stands before us is the prioritization of the startup foundation, in the opposed direction where the end justifies the means. 




Beyond what seems to be a narrative pushing for accelerated effort, the fast-paced mode of execution has also infiltrated the context of management analysis and planning. Things have not sped up simply because people are running more, working more intensively, or because managers coordinate the frenetic pace because they enjoy it. The fast mode is supported by functions, or resources, that are “ready” and available at hand. And furthermore, an outstanding necessity of using the data, which can be seen as decision making induced.

--> 


In the modern reality of the knowledge worker, data have come to be used as tools, as mechanisms to accelerate decisions. The former CEO of Intel, Andy Grove, in "Arguing with Data," warned [^grovefastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people should argue their debates with data already in hand (GROVEDATA, p .116). In alignment with Andy's consideration, Jeff Besos's concern is also recognized among managers in general and within Amazon that people lie with data [^footnote_jeff_besos_amazon_data], and that they do that not as an evil by intention but to please the audience. 

[^footnote_jeff_besos_amazon_data]: I don't know much about Amazon but I have heard some strong ideas from Jeff Besos which are flowing through and helping out managers, which goes along with the consideration from Andy; his effort to make a culture that is known as a truth-seeking culture, his recognition that people can lie with data, such as to please others of themselves, and his call to use reflecting writing, and reflecting reading, as a way to escape the traps of looking to data in the face of needs. I would then say through Amazon Jeff had supported the consideration from Andy into the culture.

[^grovefastdata]: In Andy Grove's book, "Only the Paranoid Survive," the quoted phrase in English reads, “Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It’s good advice. All too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis.” The warning applies to what he termed a "Strategic Inflection Point," situations so adverse and unexpected that they befuddle companies. Intel survived crises of this magnitude and later also became a leading player. In these situations, the anticipatory data can be misleading.

From these considerations, we may be pleased to pause this thinking with an objection, as in to say "hold your horsers there too," as you saying that more data, and more information actually is worse than no information and guesses? Maybe, but temporarily. Maybe we are considering here that in front of more we may fall with confusion. In Technology, Management, and Society, Peter Drucker has contextualized that the situation of information abundance does impact effective communications which was stressed as the kind of communication where the receiver effectively understand and collaborates, as opposed to passively accept the message: 

> *"More and better information does not solve the communication problem, nor does it bridge the communication gap. On the contrary, the more information the greater is the need for functioning and effective communication becomes. The more information available, in other words, the greater is the communications gap likely to be. The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and application, that is, on communications. In the second place, the more effective the information process, the more impersonal and formal will it become, the more will it separate human beings and thereby require separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the human relationships, the relationship of communication. It may be said that the effectiveness of the information process will depend increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of effective communication - that is, in the present situation - the information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can produce is data."*

This form of operating decisions — with data — provokes us to reflect upon what can apparently look like a mechanization of cognition, which runs together with the the pressure of greater efficiency at work. The presence of data becomes concrete, providing people with "good data" which supports good reasons when faced with a decision that needs to be made. Data captivate us, certainly, because they work so well, when they do work.

In the interconnected and turbulent world, experts are constantly under pressure to provide "faster" and more modern solutions for things they are already familiar with. Why send individual emails when you can send a million at once? It seems as though all available solutions appear useful and efficient. Additionally, in this environment, when you seek assistance, it’s not hard to find a multitude of resources available that, in one way or another, say "yes, I can help," but by the intrinsic applicability of pulling data and transforming data in what generally appers to be information. In other words, these resources by their implied expertise in their fields and their readiness, in terms of able to pull data, or to execute with data, induces the decision-making process. It may be a programmer who codes faster, an engineer who calculates more quickly; but in the real world are are to a greater extent the become the gatekeepers as they know how to use the tools that are on the way of the data. In other words, we depend on the people that knows how to use tools that can get the data - which can be seen as the data people. And under an extremme point of view, the more they are busy being experts in terms of how to deal with these tools and data and less with purpose, they essentially become tools. And this situation gets too quite complex the more we get tools which are more integrated, or automated, or connected with data, or integrated with live data, and are readily available, therefore enabling us to be decision makers which may react from the presence of outstanding data. 

These are some of the elements that may promote action that gets into the language of our managerial narratives. Through the availability of data, and tools that are now connected with data, it sets a movement of inertial which conveniently asks us to continue on that highly performant execution path - precisely because an external reference point may not be always present to prompt a counterview of purpose. In this world, where speed can accelerate any specialty, we are led to believe that we can move even faster, even if we make mistakes or take a detour. Or we are to believe that it's okay to be failing faster and learning from post-mortem analysis, as a theme that makes sense. 

However, reflection is necessary and important, as getting to the wrong place faster not only means delay but also implies the consumption of energy, resources, willpower, and motivation. Therefore, it can't be said that entrepreneurs will promptly jump into the action, the data, and the tools that support flow decisions; exactly because anyone willing to engage in entrepreneurship is now equipped with stories, methods, and systems that are made for entrepreneurs. This goes back to Drucker's thought about the excess of information, it only requires more from us. And the solution gone haywire which generally chimes in - likely one to tell you what to go, a plug and play something, a framework for that too.

* outline - introduction, answer 3 - Comes decision making, lean induction, generalist-specialist [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 

The renowned Steve Blank, a father of the lean movement, had addressed a fundamental issue with startups since 2014. His vision was that entrepreneurs think of their startups as smaller versions of large companies. He kept on reminding them that "startups are not smaller versions of large companies," because they are essentially in a discovery phase, which differs from a large company that has already identified its function in the market with a better validation of its product. One key takeaway is many of these lean methodologies started with good principles, such as asking us to keep up the purpose and keep up learing is key elements.  

By now, lean methods have matured, and a lot about the subject (not operating as a large company and recognizing the discovery phase) exists in startup literature and also be recognized through the modern systems that support lean movements, through platforms, methodologies, and startup structures. However, now and a decade later from many of us running with the lean startup movement (in a quite dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem that grew in size) there are far too many solutions being used by entrepreneurs, that puts them in a position to be harassed by these solutions which would not be exacltly, or initially, seen as specialized solutions. But ends up being so, creating a specialized mindset for operating with these. In other words, many of these methods to help with decisions are used in ways where we can embrace being a kind of specialized generalist. All of this sets us in a high-performance cockpit of startup development where it seems applicable to run on a great high-speed road of innovation. It is all one-click to do, it is all "plug-and-play". It's beautiful.

The key problem is that these are now connected, and lean leads to decision making. They are now essentially subject to being trapped by using lean, claiming to use lean, which is essentially in a business of closing gaps, not matter the gaps. As an example, they can enter closing the gap of validation, so they bring equilibrium by advancing as specialists under what seems to be a generalist activity. The function of many lean methods in the start-up space is a function of supporting decision making for innovation. And that may take too, by its power, to become powerful, and powerfully dangerous, the exact reason for us to be conscious about the power of being "experts" dealing with these methodologies, tools, and data. 

Now coherent narratives are done by systems. In other words, frameworks, platforms, and all sorts and supporting systems - accelerators, incubators, networking and funding platforms, are all part of the richer landscape - supports teams to achieve potential output that would perhaps sling them into even faster growth. These solutions promise acceleration and claim to solve the entrepreneur's journey. 













<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - introduction, Complication, answer - Generalist decision-making gone haywire 
--> 

Can we blame abudance of options? No one is being forced, we know. So we can't blame abundance plus too that all good exciting new things are being done by the building blocks given, in a way or another. Still, the reality is that in the rush to act by these productive instincts, they scramble to seek solutions that they think are things that startups do. Similarly, entrepreneurs might, in their urgent processes, flee as followers of a mechanized and known corporate behavior - or a general cultural that grow ups do. It's not even a thin line to miss the point about misusing lean methods, it's generally a straight line to be thirsty for validation (about anything), to be immersed in lean processes at the risk of being enamored with the processes, which can be observation by the self promotion and self satisfaction of being advancing by practicing lean while their actions may be about actually procrastinating using lean.

When we are hungry for the breakfast and in front of the all-you-can-it buffet, with solutions for everything for all the phases of growth, the crew feels empowered to pick more. And worse of all, taken from the beauty of all, entrepreneurship rises from a hungry spirit, on one hand, and on the other entrepreneurship demands the crew to accept that digestion problems are part of the course. Thus, entrepreneurship calls for growth and growth supports call to action, such as to eat more and to shop more.

This book is about procrastination disguised as entrepreneurial action, that looks like getting things done. Then it's about courage to use time to balance our views. Then it's about permission to work in what matters beyond the known matters of what appears to matter, then it's about and self-respect, which accounts our energy. 

It takes courage to see productivity as procrastination. It takes permission to see through, through new goggles, to believe that something really great can be found by not being a controller. And self-respect because entrepreneurship recognizes the doer that is not a know-it-all, recognizes that the real A comes from Fs and not from Bs. It's not necessarily about joining the club because the beat seems to be the "beat of the moment." The greatest abuse an entrepreneur can commit is when they start to sacrifice who they are and see them through the eyes of the system - to shape a professional identity. 

From that they fail to comply with their own values, with the well-being, and with their ability to discover what they are essentially doing. It takes them to confusion, or into a fusion, and from that to produce far too many outcomes to their selves, to their colleagues, to the future of their corporations. It costs them.

In other words, we aim a strategy that ceases to be reactive or speed-oriented from the pressures clamoring for results. Thus we will set themselves to avoid resorting to abuses that form a toxic culture centered where the end justifies the means. In such a culture, work dances with the bursts of motivational incentives, while possible signs of an environment detrimental to the work itself and the development of the team's work methodology are silenced. The strategy cannot be reduced to just going with the flow, by following the shadows of the world’s accelerated pace. We don’t just want speed, to run for the sake of running. On the contrary, execution and effort is meant to set us to be learners again, to start again, to renew our views, to gain perspective. Thus, we are into a mission for leaning about growth, as individuals and as leaders of our organizations. By doing so, we create a learning organization, which is one of the goals of this reflection and opportunity. 

Therefore, we bring situations, complications, and reflections that were not designed as recipes, as ready-made solutions to solve the adversities and complexities of the urgent mode. The idea is to strengthen, or to recover, or to keep alive, a truly entrepreneurial side of the entrepreneurial spirit. This is so that you can confront the chaos, the pressure, or what appears to be a normal crazyness [^basecampcrazy] of work which is incessantly urgent and rarely seen as toxic. 

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried and Hansson are the founders of Basecamp, a well-known company from Silicon Valley, in "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," argue that it is necessary to work against the industry's toxic instincts and norms that avoids the possibility of managing a company calmly. The expression "It's crazy at work" is used by them to describe a work environment where pressure, such as excessive working hours, and consequences like anxiety, are the norm; and they reject this idea in favor of a calmer and more balanced work environment.

In other words, our strategy does not involve selling out the human being as part of the process, discarding our greatest resource. This idea necessarily creates a force, or principle, of self-respect. It sets boundaries for the well-being for the entrepreneur which I regard as the highest investment and the actual only real way to navigate through the startup environment and into growth. This will be our guiding principle for many of the reflections through the three parts to come.

Running the risk of commiting a fault in the world of standard writers, I will bring part part of a quote I used in this introduction, Maslow's advice that we can't be driven by the outer: 

> *"There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

In part one, through *Urgency of the Self*, to support our conscious attitude for the road ahead, the road of growth of the startup which we assume that can only be achieved by self growth under the tenet that we are not expendable, that we value our beings and that who we are as entrepreneurs matches who we are as human beings - that everyone is an entrepreneur and that the role developed by entrepreneurship is not an indentity that is used for a business which is separated from us as a whole. We look at who we are, we value who we are, so that we can respect ourselves through the navigation that may set us into traps, into a disconnect. Through this part we go from key elements of who we are and straightly reflecting about our situation in the middle of the environment, through the inclination for running, through the journey of impact. Above all, we check on ourselves rather than to look for the external. Although the startup journey can't be controlled, our invest relies in observations and reflections about us doing it in ways that are less frustrating, less confusing, less arbitrary, and more fruitful, minimally in terms of the being conscious about our best selves which is key for the road ahead.

Through the second part, *Urgency of the Team*, we extent our reflections to improve the health of the team dynamics as it improve its collaboration. We start by considering how the urgent rises from execution and the challenging space this creates for keep the conscious view of purpose, such as how we start to fail with our entrepreneurial characterizations and entrepreneurship well-being causing the entrepreneurial function to lag behind, or be obfuscated by the movement of progress. We give special consideration for the dynamics that are given by applicability of lean movements and how teams generally think they are advancing but actually building up a great level of disconnection from their purpose. We wrap this part by valuing communication not as a communication serving the purpose of goals, like a tool, but a view for communication that serves for the growing the team in the first place.

We complete the book through *Urgency in the system*, considering general elements that affects teams organization-wide ways. We recognize that the growth up and productive state of an organization demands a goal system that needs to be efficient. To that, we ask of our goal management efforts to being flexible, to be conscious, to be honest. As a final reflection, we will consider the beautiful and powerful world of narratives that involves celebrating how we get to do amazing things quick - such as to pull effort from humans - but too why to never do it without being conscious and aware of the dynamics of how our narrative systems influences control in ways we are not aware - given by voices through platforms, networks, systems, tools, technologies - by its own inherantly powerful characterizations if we assume ourselves as Homom narrans. 










This is a book for everyone who supports entrepreneurs, but particularly for those who care about them and are concerned with their health and their psychological well-being; hence for those who do not think that entrepreneurs are expendable. They are the ones in the arena, and it is a complicated space, full of urgencies and a fast-paced nature, which could prompt them into action and a natural inclination to miss the space for evaluating themselves. Thus, it becomes a book for entrepreneurs themselves as naturally, they will likely be alone at times, and will bear the responsibility to grow themselves, to learn and adapt from experiences. Being open, and involved, into an enlightenment should be acknowledged as part of entrepreneurship. This is especially necessary as entrepreneurs are expected to be in a position to change reality, to free themselves from the normal way things are done, which requires adapting and changing themselves. Entrepreneurial action invites new management.

Now it is even funny that the pro and corporate world can even make it sound nice even when shit hits the fan, when the situaton would get to the "folks, we didn't do well," the pro world too brings the spirits back and planes back on track. As long as there is life in this park, the adventure won't stop. A sign in the lobby reads "When Dinousaurs Ruled the Earth," reaffirms they are okay in the middle of that colorful and chaotic world of beasts and not so broken broken things being improved. And if anyone insists in taking things too seriously - looking around or suspecting that the whole park is a mess - the actual hallways are there too to remind them, to bring back the colorfulness and the soft drink dispensers and premium quality ice cream which is a reminder that all of that is supported by the monumental investment of a charismatic investor who spared no expenses. They will protect us to keep the park running. Our motto says that "it's fun to work". Here we do not take life so serious anyway.
