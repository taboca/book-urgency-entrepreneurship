This is a book about getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]. Now, I know that this is a pretty strong statement for a book entitled *Slow Down to Start Up*. So I won't go as far to say that this is the fastest way to get things done, and specifically to the context of founders trying to do startups. But when I wrote this statement and thought about the really fast way to get things done, it came to my mind that there are good and fast or lucky ways - such as when winning bets, not to say gambling, or on the other hand, when value is captured directly, when one picks the opportunity passing by. This also leads me to think about that success and impact can be either created or taken, designed and made or captured.

[^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]: The theme of getting things done have sometimes created confusion to me when I thought about innovation and impact. Because I first thought that getting things done for the sake of getting things done may be arbitrary and appears to be about a waste of resources. The view of Schumpeter helped me to be calmer, because he simplified, under the perspective that in a dynamic world of exchanges it appears a necessity for effiency and from comparison among similar ways to get things done people pick more efficient ones. And from that creative new things solves their problems in new ways, as in 10x more effient, this connects with the idea of creative destruction. 

From another view, if we were at a crossroad, take right to take or the left to make, ours is not the one that seems to be the right way, or faster or closer. Although ours appears the longer way, it does carry a value that characterizes our relationship, that founders are not expendable. We'll get back to that, but in short I want you to be around, not only through this reflective moment of reading, but also throughout the path of your startup and your startup throughout the path of the world. All of us to last.

Now, as we take that path, the slower or the calmer which I like to call the conscious, we are certainly acknowledging that the movement of getting things done requires founders to learn as they go. As in, to learn the skills to do what needs to be done. However, this learning is not only about the founder because the well-being of the organization is essentially required to follow along. To elaborate on that, we should pick a start-up definition; and a good one which connects with our fundamental principles aligned with this book is the one from Paul Graham where the start-up means growth:

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of "exit." The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.*" (Graham, Paul., 2012)

Now if we follow this growth [^foonote_paulgraham_startup_growth] viewpoint, which I like to see it as an invitation through his article *Startup = Growth* (2012), you will soon understand that it is about what it takes for the startup to grow through values for being able to last. He indeed brought requirements which show an intention to scale, but the in essence it does a service for us, in alignment with *Do Things That Don't Scale* as it prompt us to see the characterizations of a conscious founder and the conscious team which precedes the growth situation. This view aligns with other characterizations of this dynamics between founders and startups with the market. One in special is given by the Blitzscaling model brought by Chris Yeh and Reid Hoffman, which starts from the view of growth too although sets a breakdown by stages - family, tribe, village, city and nation - which again essentially invite us to organize and into the discussion and to reflect about the other characterizations in terms of what it takes. As an example, from the Blitzscaling lecture 18, an interview with Brian Chesky (the CEO of Airbnb), he had put in perspective the learning challenges throughout these stages - for a founder that is around throughout all the stages - as one that is not about developing a skill continuously but essentially about having to learn something complete new, like a whole new sport. We'll come back to Brian in further chapters. But right now, to think about what it takes through these stages takes me to think that of a path of evolution, so I see the biological process for a butterfly.

[^foonote_paulgraham_startup_growth]: Paul Graham's definition of startup equals to growth is used here, although to do it fast might confuse me, on what that means; while I become calmer when observing Paul Graham's article entitled *Do Things that Don't Scale* and other ideas where essentially fast means the find conscious ways of growing.

@outline - Complicated situation - Abundant world, interactions, confusion. Intro to mechanized founder. 
--> 

When I look to a holistic view - a growth curve if you will - and consider the learning challenges, it comes to my mind a saying from Reid Hoffman which he carries in his pocket and says that essentially a founder jumps off a cliff and tries to assemble an airplane on her way down. When I sum some nuanced observations from Blitzscaling or Brian, and think about the evolution of the butterfly, it takes me to see the challenge as of one that jumps off a cliff,  tries to assemble an airplane on the way down, and assembles it, and then is prompted to learn how to fly, and as it does, and then it's prompted to know where to go, and so on.

Although this frames the situation for what this book is about, the special reason for us to be here has to do with something that has changed on our way. It may be since the industrial revolution, and over the years, but now might be a source of concern. This is our space, the space where we do things. Because our world is hotter, bigger, faster, we have lots of things, in terms of solutions, things to go for doing it, that are interactive or iterative. These things, solutions, and here and there to help our ways but they can be overwhelming or confusing, we know that. And dealing with that is not only important to the young, but also to the experienced founders, and quite applicable to experienced leaders in major and grown-up organizations. In this bigger world, with its abundance of solutions, there are just too many things now teasing us, not to say bombarded, by their packages and voices. Again, we know that. An we know too that these aren't there to bring us trouble. So we know that they are not evil, at least that a lot of things aren't, to some or a greater extent, that they are valid and applicable to specific conditions. Because these are the things that solve real problems, and these are the tools or the building blocks, and many are cheap and easy to plug in and quite important too. And sometimes security is fantastic and other things are quite required.


But we are teased to check them, teased to taste, or to buy or to pick and then unbox them. We can be involved and these can be good thoughts (ideas, thoughts, methods), no doubt. And on top of these things, or on the side or underneath, there are other beings, like us or in part different. They are involved, as practitioners or advisors or experts, you name it. But they care, with us; so they are not indifferent. And there are systems too. And sometimes we look at all and if we sum all we will see superpowers. But no superpower, I think, is as powerful as not being alone; because, as Sam Altman once said - if I am not mistaken - founders are lonely. And there is more, that our ways there are other interesting things which are platforms. Now when I picture myself in that fall trying to assemble my airplane, or to control it, I don’t see these platforms falling. Relativelly, I see a sort of carrier, fully equipped, and its roads for taking off. And then we hear the calls, their voices, which I can't say that are enchanting, because a lot I hear seem to be solid narratives. I see coherence.




















<!--
* @outline - Complication - The getting things done implies in specialized movement first, and it feels great. And that sets the complication of change, as comparative analysis. Although ambitions for entrepreneurial action is widespread, the outcomes as in to innovate, are driven by execution first; tied to the environment. Which seems not in alignment with entrepreneurial action which refuses the environment. Corporations, specialists, expenddable, Guacamole, means lower investment in training. But effects of new training are coming in other ways, through methods that does the job of the learning. We are not required to evolve ourselves.  
-->




Now to consider that dynamic and busy world influencing (our path for getting things done) we may consider an inductive movement, one which is action-oriented or perhaps one which creates a language of action. This may be intrinsic and driven by that abundance. In other words, we're compelled to be busy with execution. But it's one which in the modern view does not ignore learning. As an example, we may consider the corporate world and how learning is being carried over through the actual execution. Considering the spending in training in comparison with other execution investments. In the 2018, in a summit entitled *The Future of Talent - Transcending Work*, (Global Silicon Valley, 2018) Rob Biederman, the then CEO of Catalant Technologies, highlighted an intriguing aspect of corporate spending priorities, pointing that a large company which likely the audience were shareholders, allocates less budget per employee on training than his own startup spends on avocados.

That view can certainly show part of the problem, although we cannot infer that on the other side execution is merely execution that doesn't care about innovation or doesn't care about learning. That is not the case. Therefore, if we consider the many processes and that businesses are essentially wishing to innovate, certainly by the necessity of the environment and the competitive forces minimally; which can be observable as it shows clearly that there are elements or methods and the building blocks following goals, aspirational goals to innovate, and by that using means, like design thinking or many lean methods, and others intended for that. In other words, our businesses welcome innovation, they want to innovate, while they do so by creating a normal work routine which certainly carry ties with the control organization that is in need to organize and attempt to execute all of that as normal work, which may lead to business as usual if possible. In other words, the creative brain of corporations are somewhat controlled, not to say mechanized or automated, which is not an absurd as indeed they're trying to automate it - if that were possible. If that may be a problem or not for some organizations and corporations, we might take that aside as a consideration which might be applicable to us.








Because these characterizations are found in the realm of the entrepreneur of the modern day, characterizing the beginning, the early stage of startups, which certainly involves the process of discovery and the goals of innovation. And the use of methods or tools and also data that is highly available. In other words, they are pressured and might be in part controlled, also influencing and inducing decision making. Now, to provoke ourselves, we may consider the intrinsic element of entrepreneurship or the founder - or the artist - that is not 100% taken by normal ways of execution. And they are involved in breaking the rules of the environment, if we look back throughout history. So they might be involved in breaking the rules of the environment in synergistic ways and rethinking the use of tools and methods as they grow. A thought from Maslow in *Toward the Psychology of Being* can help us here:

> *"The danger that I see is the resurgence, in new and more sophisticated forms, of the old identification of psychological health with adjustment, adjustment to reality, adjustment to society, adjustment to other people. That is, the authentic or healthy person may be defined not in his own right, not in his autonomy, not by his own intra-psychic and non-environmental laws, not as *different* from the environment, independent of it or opposed to it, but rather in environment-centered terms, e.g., of ability to master the environment, to be capable, adequate, effective, competent in relation to it, to do a good job, to perceive it well, to be in good relations to it, to be successful in its terms. To say it in another way, the job-analysis, the requirements of the task, should not be the major criterion of worth or health of the individual. There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

Now if we set the focus back to our path, to that crossroads where the way that appears to be right based on what we know how to do it likely influenced by this whole environment that support us in doing the right ways and the other way which is to essentially to realize that the crossroad has to be imagined and created in the first place and that more than that that we throughout various stages like the growth stages given by Blitzscale but not only through that but within the the routine of work these moments have to be preserved as part of normal work so essentially that we should call ourselves to create the crossroad in the first place and to be conscious about the necessity to be conscious

Before we go back to that focus, we should consider how the narrative for pushing by effort and to execute as business as usual into the realm of management and planning. So it's not things that has sped up or managers are intended to do it faster, or that they enjoying the frenetic ways of doing; but in fact, it follows from that functions and resources and data are readily available at hand. So we may consider the higher availability of the building blocks - like data, tools and methods for decision making - as strongly present are supporting that inductive movement. And moreover, taking our attention to that situation of being intentional of setting a crossroad in front of us.

* outline - introduction, answer 1 - situation of data and information improving - feat. Peter Drucker of data  
--> 

As our modern reality is paved by the knowledge worker; it's been a while that great minds had brought up some concerns about the knowledge elements influencing our decisions. This former CEO of Intel, Angy Grove, in *Arguing with Data*, warned [^footnote_andygrove_fastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people should argue their debates, with data right in hand. In alignment with Andy's observations and reflections, Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, is known for his concern helping management in general to be aware and conscious that people lie with data and that they don't do so because of necessary evil of intention, but in part to please audiences [^footnote_jeff_lie_data], which may be inferred and it's clearly observed that it's part of a phenomenon where we're essentially being both controllers or controlled by the very presence of data.

[^footnote_andygrove_fastdata]: In Andy Grove's book, "Only the Paranoid Survive," the quoted phrase in English reads, “Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It’s good advice. All too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis.” The warning applies to what he termed a "Strategic Inflection Point," situations so adverse and unexpected that they befuddle companies. Intel survived crises of this magnitude and later also became a leading player. In these situations, the anticipatory data can be misleading.

[^footnote_jeff_lie_data]: In a further chapter we will get back to this case, but if for reference check Greylock. (2017, June 20). The Job of a CFO at a Scaling Company with Sarah Friar and Jason Child | The Scaleup Offsite 2017 [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgVab3NeP-k

If an objection din't cross your mind, I'll throw the stone as in to say "hold your horses! are you telling me that more data and more information, as in passively available, does worse than no information at all and managing with guesses?" Maybe yes, maybe no. We are essentially considering that. Certainly there's no evil in passive data and knowledge available. But we are considering that there's something in us, from our willingness to use it and to engage with it, that might actually take us into that space of confusion. In *Technology, Management, and Society*, Peter Drucker has contextualized a situation where information abundance does impact effective communication, which he highlights defining it as the kind of communication where the receiver actually understands and collaborates, as opposed to passive acceptance of the message:

> *"More and better information does not solve the communication problem, nor does it bridge the communication gap. On the contrary, the more information the greater is the need for functioning and effective communication becomes. The more information available, in other words, the greater is the communications gap likely to be. The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and application, that is, on communications. In the second place, the more effective the information process, the more impersonal and formal will it become, the more will it separate human beings and thereby require separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the human relationships, the relationship of communication. It may be said that the effectiveness of the information process will depend increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of effective communication - that is, in the present situation - the information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can produce is data."*

@meta@outline - grade 5 - narrative rationality. 
--> 


We are considering a form of operating decisions, as in with data and with knowledge, by the tools or methods along, and with that to provoke us about a situation of mechanized cognition that may quite observable under pressure, or a need for greater efficiency, of work or business as usual. Moreover that the abundance of these building blocks can be quite meaningful in the right moment in time, as in that under the abundance it is possible to find good data that becomes good reasons for the narratives of decision-making in the collaborative environment-based communication. In other words, data captivate us because they may be so well ready in the right context and time. By induction, we follow, as we know that the right data in the right time supports a good narrative - we have seen it working. Thus, when the stars align, we may be teased to decide.

On top of that, there has been a while that we know of the many tools that deal with data, like the tools to pull data or the tools to dispatch data. And because data is value, these tools become value. Why to send an individual email that it can send a million at once? Why to pull by hand data to analyze if you can query millions of records? In this realm, in the face of an outstanding pain - or need for the "big data" - the importance of seeking assistance too rises. Thus and in order to understand its meaning before decisions we go for the experts that use these tools. In other words, there might be a programmer or an expert in data or an engineer who calculates quickly and knows what to do. He or she or it knows how to manipulate data. And they become important by the very fact that they are, to a certain extent, gatekeepers. And the more they are incentivized as valuable by the fact that they manipulate that in and out, to a certain degree, they become great. Thus, on an extreme point of view, we can incentivize them to be busy being experts of how to manipulate data and use the tools and less involved in looking from above or to bother about the contrarian view or the view of purpose or to see from perspective; which makes them to be essentially teaased to be comfortable as tools. And this circles back to inducing the movement of decision making by the high availability of knowledge or data and the ability of entities (i.e. people) that knows how to manipulate data in the first place.

* outline - introduction, answer 3 - Comes decision making, lean induction, generalist-specialist [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 



Now the reason that we look at the grown-up situation is because it's all interconnected. And to a greater degree corporations set certain standards or reflect the actual standards of the world especially when corporations enter the space of trying to innovate into the entrepreneurial effort. In this context we may consider the concerns from Steve Blank, the father of the lean movement, when he addressed the fundamental issues with startups since 2014. His vision that entrepreneurs think that their startups are smaller versions of large companies and since he kept alert and conscious about that. He kept on reminding them that startups are not smaller versions of large companies. He kept reminding them that they essentially are in the discovery phase. Discovery phase. One take away. It's clear. If you really go into the lean methodology you'll see good principles and solid principles. And the lean leader is always present and concerned about that. Asking us to keep an eye on the purpose. To keep learning. To keep aware. 


By now, a decade later, with the lean movement quite matured and widely used by founders and teams, startups and also corporations, we have enough conversations and concerns from the potential misuses of these methods, characterizing the phenomenon of a controller who, in the door, by getting things done, essentially doing business as usual and working by using the methods, just like lying with data case of Andy Grove, they're actually lying with the methods to go along with the idea of saying that they're using lean and not using lean in other extremes, and that may be about, to a certain extent, a specialized characterization of the generalist movement of entrepreneurship, not to say mechanized generalist.




Now, to characterize two levels of complications for us, there's certainly an extreme case of us being trapped by these tiers, as in data and tools and ways of deciding, taking us to close gaps, no matter what gaps, or to seek validation for the sake of validation, and valuing validation to bring the equilibrium by advancing our processes, thus developing us as specialists, even though in moments when we need the generalist mindset. In other words, being essentially powerful, becoming powerful and with that, powerfully dangerous. But that's not even the main reason, because that sounds extreme. There's an intermediary situation of us being distracted from using our energy, and using our creative energy. Especially in that beginning, and that's vital for founders and their startups and influences of the culture and the success and the future of the organization. In other words, because these elements can be cheaply accessible, we may get involved in a trial-and-error way of doing, mostly. Not realizing that we are 100% focusing on that, and learning by post-mortem analysis, mostly. And with that, using our energy and focus, and setting ourselves out of being conscious for acquiring different perspectives, for seeking, shock-observing, which is vital, especially knowing of the growth, not only the general growth, but the growth through the Blitzscaling stages, but also the day-to-day moments when we need to actually see from different perspectives and kill our own lyon, to kill our know-it-all being which prevent us to see how to change. This is essentially being busy with the affairs that take us from seeing the view of purpose [^footnote_ericries_purpose], to miss the holistic view.

[^footnote_ericries_purpose]: Eric Ries, the renowned author of *The Lean Start-Up* and *The Start-up Way* carries his concern with the situation when the view of purpose is lost even in organizations that can use the lean methods professionally.

Therefore, we bring situations, complications, and reflections that were not designed as recipes, as ready-made solutions to solve the adversities and complexities of the urgent mode. The idea is to strengthen, or to recover, or to keep alive, a truly entrepreneurial side of the entrepreneurial spirit. This is so that you can confront the chaos, the pressure, or what appears to be a normal crazyness [^basecampcrazy] of work which is incessantly urgent and rarely seen as toxic. 

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried and Hansson are the founders of Basecamp, a well-known company from Silicon Valley, in "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," argue that it is necessary to work against the industry's toxic instincts and norms that avoids the possibility of managing a company calmly. The expression "It's crazy at work" is used by them to describe a work environment where pressure, such as excessive working hours, and consequences like anxiety, are the norm; and they reject this idea in favor of a calmer and more balanced work environment.

In other words, our strategy does not involve selling out the human being as part of the process, discarding our greatest resource. This idea necessarily creates a force, or principle, of self-respect. It sets boundaries for the well-being for the entrepreneur which I regard as the highest investment and the actual only real way to navigate through the startup environment and into growth. This will be our guiding principle for many of the reflections through the three parts to come.

Running the risk of commiting a fault in the world of standard writers, I will bring part part of a quote I used in this introduction, Maslow's advice that we can't be driven by the outer: 

> *"There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

In part one, through *Urgency of the Self*, to support our conscious attitude for the road ahead, the road of growth of the startup which we assume that can only be achieved by self growth under the tenet that we are not expendable, that we value our beings and that who we are as entrepreneurs matches who we are as human beings - that everyone is an entrepreneur and that the role developed by entrepreneurship is not an indentity that is used for a business which is separated from us as a whole. We look at who we are, we value who we are, so that we can respect ourselves through the navigation that may set us into traps, into a disconnect. Through this part we go from key elements of who we are and straightly reflecting about our situation in the middle of the environment, through the inclination for running, through the journey of impact. Above all, we check on ourselves rather than to look for the external. Although the startup journey can't be controlled, our invest relies in observations and reflections about us doing it in ways that are less frustrating, less confusing, less arbitrary, and more fruitful, minimally in terms of the being conscious about our best selves which is key for the road ahead.

Through the second part, *Urgency of the Team*, we extent our reflections to improve the health of the team dynamics as it improve its collaboration. We start by considering how the urgent rises from execution and the challenging space this creates for keep the conscious view of purpose, such as how we start to fail with our entrepreneurial characterizations and entrepreneurship well-being causing the entrepreneurial function to lag behind, or be obfuscated by the movement of progress. We give special consideration for the dynamics that are given by applicability of lean movements and how teams generally think they are advancing but actually building up a great level of disconnection from their purpose. We wrap this part by valuing communication not as a communication serving the purpose of goals, like a tool, but a view for communication that serves for the growing the team in the first place.

We complete the book through *Urgency in the system*, considering general elements that affects teams organization-wide ways. We recognize that the growth up and productive state of an organization demands a goal system that needs to be efficient. To that, we ask of our goal management efforts to being flexible, to be conscious, to be honest. As a final reflection, we will consider the beautiful and powerful world of narratives that involves celebrating how we get to do amazing things quick - such as to pull effort from humans - but too why to never do it without being conscious and aware of the dynamics of how our narrative systems influences control in ways we are not aware - given by voices through platforms, networks, systems, tools, technologies - by its own inherantly powerful characterizations if we assume ourselves as Homom narrans.

When we are hungry for the breakfast and in front of the all-you-can-it buffet, with solutions for everything for all the phases of growth, the crew feels empowered to pick more. And worse of all, taken from the beauty of all, entrepreneurship rises from a hungry spirit, on one hand, and on the other entrepreneurship demands the crew to accept that digestion problems are part of the course. Thus, entrepreneurship calls for growth and growth supports call to action, such as to eat more and to shop more. This book is about procrastination disguised as entrepreneurial action, that looks like getting things done. Then it's about courage to use time to balance our views. Then it's about permission to work in what matters beyond the known matters of what appears to matter, then it's about and self-respect, which accounts our energy. It takes courage to see productivity as procrastination. It takes permission to see through, through new goggles, to believe that something really great can be found by not being a controller. And self-respect because entrepreneurship recognizes the doer that is not a know-it-all, recognizes that the real A comes from Fs and not from Bs. It's not necessarily about joining the club because the beat seems to be the "beat of the moment." The greatest abuse an entrepreneur can commit is when they start to sacrifice who they are and see them through the eyes of the system - to shape a professional identity.
