### Punchline - 

- Slowing down feels bad, while the urge to hurry up and run feels better.
- Slowing down is associated with uncertainty, whereas running feels connected with certainty.
- The new language of "hurry up" or "run" is reinforced by digital signals like claps, likes, and votes in collaborative environments.
- Founder struggle, being right. 

@outline
### 2. Impact on Founders

- Founders are driven to pursue small grains of success obsessively.
- This obsession can lead to missing larger opportunities.
  - Small successes may not align with the external environment and desired outcomes.
  - Reduced attention spans, reduced level of calmess, leads to becoming specialists, seeking to be right, and professionals, but missing broader opportunities.
- Moreover, eergy is wasted by focusing on misleading goals, preventing greater achievements.

When an incidental voice says "let's slow down," in a modern-world workplace, it doesn't sound great. If the team pauses, they might wonder "why is it that we can't keep doing what we were doing?" On the other hand, the "let's speed up," sounds more plausible, although modern-world variations of "keep cranking" are not noisy and given by the smooth beat of digitalized thumbs ups and claps by the hour. And that makes sense, doesn't it? That is how we keep the beat, how we sum our efforts, especially in the corporate situation that follows a somehow coherent movement that things are working, even when things aren’t. That goes with closing the gap, getting things done earlier, selling more, delivering faster, all things that in a way or another follows the wider rhythm of the competition, more or less eloquently or more or less mediocre.

The complication, on the other hand and in the heads of entrepreneurs, happens to be that thoughts of slowing down are generally felt as frustrating. In other words, it does not matter - this happens: That when we are caught opening the gap, and not getting things done sooner or selling less or delivering slower, and the like, we just don’t like it. And this is so because we are caught by that uncomfortable feeling. Now, we do know that founders or innovators have to be resilient, that they are aware of a world of uncertainty, that they need to be prepared for what does not look productive, or prepared to be wrong, initially certainly but as well throughout the growth path. And we know too, to be fair, that for many of them entrepreneurs that fear of failure, maybe a raw fear, does work as a kind of fear that drives growth, that takes them to move mountains.

But what we may not know, or feel, or fail to notice, is a feeling that happens on a by-the-hour basis, or real-time, now something that we might be quite used to. That feeling of sadness, into ourselves, into the self, felt grain by grain, to subtitle anyway to be noted. But apparent anyway from our needs to be constantly monitoring, constantly seeking to grab, constantly seeking validation. One which may materialize an inner system, a certain operating system of management; again perhaps fueled or teased or mirrored by that outer operating system of getting things done, the one that wants to feel great by those great things, the one which welcomes productivity; as in, as soon as possible.

But here we are worried, to our lives as founders and entrepreneurs of ourselves, living our own journeys, that that normal movement for grabbing what feels productive is not enough to bring out the great, for us, for the startup, and for the long term business, and for society. As for what we do out there, bargains rise as outcomes. For startups? They may pivot quickly into the first thing that seems to work. Some of them then fail and simply don't get why some weird competitor does it better. For the big corporations? It dies, by not having a way to change, or they acquire others to delay or in an attempt to import some new characterization of change. And for their leaders, they rather be replaced than to be seen as babies again.

But to ourselves, we can’t see what we pay for ourselves, running our projects or startups or our own lives like that. That we are too involved - by now - with that mechanized way of looking at life - constantly dispensing our attention, our focus, to that other part of the equation, welcoming greatness, even little great grains, grain by grain. As in, by the hour, or by the minute, and obsessively. But more than that, we can’t see that by that grain-by-grain movement we are taking us into a condition of saturation and missing living our journeys in ways connected with fundamental values. And by living that we too get, grain by grain, disconnected from our true potential.

### 3. Situational Alert

- The general language of action, in life and corporate world suggests using humans as expendable resources.
  - Example: High spending on guacamole (positive experience) vs. low spending on training (boring but necessary).
- Founders cannot replace themselves and must take care not to see themselves as expendable.
- For us all, and founders too, retrospective fixing our actions are costly and should be avoided.

* Prior outline - introduction, complication - An abstraction, a question, a provocation: Can this be a passive-aggressive managerial system? If I turn fun -> bitter, conclusion is bad management? All is wrong or just wrong if we take the wheel to use this translate into entrepreneurial action?

### It's fun to work and do it right 



Should we blame our corporate world, as the producers of that specialist spirit which prevent us from embracing that generalist mindset when we need it? I don’t think so, in fact it’s all around. Our office space just happens to carry on a characterization. There seems to be something, Mechanized or Specialized, that grows in us. A strength that sticks with us. And one too that take us to fear, so badly or cryptic, the idea of slowing down.

Something about that we seem to know. It may be observable in our educated world as we know it, certainly in our work spaces, in our families, and inside of us. Deep inside, we know it, somewhere from our regressions — the size of that monumental investment we took before that great walking far from the leg of our mother. And how it felt after we went back to her hugging and lovely smile. We went through our first exit, successfully. From that, we like it or not, we carried too that other knowing. The knowing about what it takes, that other monumental thing we need (from us or someone else,) before we do that other new thing ahead of us, that new movement. This may be the will to stick, if you will.

But a bit different from our parents who were trying to balance their part policeman and part therapist roles, the corporate world, policies if you will, might have added some fun to the whole thing. In particular, focusing on the “just do it” or “keep walking” element. Because “it’s fun to work,” isn’t it? Well, maybe not in all office spaces but certainly there is one that looks like an amusement park somewhere. Somewhere, remotely or closer to you, there is a modern bridge made of soda cans, now digitally mastered. There their builders can digitally scan their daily intake of cans and they can then see their own monster effort, in real-time, a reflection of their ability to build. This is much better than vanity metrics, they know. Because they can see effort, not prizes. So it’s honest, to some extent, and it is fun, and it is colorful, and the bridge looks like a rainbow.

A slight complication of this fun-to-work office space is that some new complications can’t be just brought up. For complaints, for things not so fun, it may not be too fun if you don’t know how to do it. If an arbitrary crying voice escapes through the hallways, he or she may get a ‘whiner’ flair on her jacket. But that is not a flair too big, nor meant to hurt. It’s one that is colorful, one that to some extent is fun to wear, to get one of those. Through that, we may have invented some humanized ways to do these relations that does the function of equalizing the situation. And it does avoid big trouble, we know it, it prevents the whole bridge falling apart by silencing the potential networked echoes of that cry. And of course, it’s humanized too in other ways because it knows some of the therapeutic tricks and it’s principled to just enough silence the cry but not enough to silence the spirit. In other words, it never loses the warrior, it never goes gray.

In other words, if a few heads say that too many men or too many people are making too many problems, from somewhere it comes, up in the sky, a supermanager wearing his red shirt with a big yellow M and the cape is for embracing all of them whiners, pronto. He is there to offer a hand made of steel, a helping hand, one that pours just enough rain on their blowing parade but not enough to cloud their horizon from that view, that rainbow, that fun-to-work office. This is how equilibrium is dispensed in this great-to-work space. It does so by serving the spirits and by setting us to keep walking with these special shoes that just do it.

I don’t think that our corporate world had invented Doing it or took us into the walking, being specialists, and into fears of being generalists. Perhaps the corporate Machine just added more toppings to that good ice cream.














But in perspective, if any of that language of action exists, it might do so as a result of an passive-aggressive work environment that favors a situation that leans heavily on extracting effort from humans. Althought guacamole could be evidently present [^footnote_guacamole_traning] in some of the best working places, it is arguably unfair to celebrate the exagerations given by these illustrations such as the implied idea that an action-oriented style of management, as opposed to real management, is the main beast we should fear. But the truth that I am after - throughout my attempt to turn what appears to be fun into bitterness - lies in considering the dangers of our inclination, as humans, to when we turn to become entrepreneurs and grab the wheel. When we operate the early stage with the same kinds of movements of the accelerated or productive world as we know it, as in to pursue the end no matter the means. Not a truth sought by the modern worker that operates  a mechanical equipment that put the life of their colleagues at risk, but in the sense of an entrepreneur that enters into entrepreneurship as if it is a car and suddently focuses on the road ahead, and feels that the equipment is there to accelerate into the destination, and by doing so denies to invest in developing consciousness for its behaviors, such as the management of entrepreneurship. 

[^footnote_guacamole_traning]: In the 2018 ASU GSV Summit during the Main Stage Panel titled "The Future of Talent -- Transcending Work," Rob Biederman, Co-Founder and CEO of Catalant Technologies, highlighted an intriguing aspect of corporate spending priorities. He pointed out that a large company which likely the audience were shareholders, allocates less budget per employee on training than his own startup spends on avocados. This remark emphasizes the disparity in investment priorities, particularly in training and education, compared to seemingly trivial expenses like avocados (Global Silicon Valley, 2018) expect that it may not be trivial in the sense of keeping the train moving as it is.

### Three dimensional problem 


<!-- 
@meta @Outline
### 4. Complications from Situations
- The fast-paced, networked environment dictates what to do, how to do, and why to do it.
- The hypermarket of solutions provides answers for everything, creating a positive bias in decision-making.
- Generalist of the shelf, entrepreneurship confused with BAU 

* prior outline - introduction - #Complication that Managers are followers?
--> 



To put in perspective, in the light of our strategy throught the book, the recognition of that language of action - particularly illustrated in the corporate sphere - is a starting point so that we can consider what we do, how we do, and what we do, is a movement that is driven. As an example, consider that our propensity to drive by key results, such as seeking key results connected with outcomes, rises from the individual which makes it synergentically projected in the collaborative situations of work. In the same perspective, it isn't a higher-order force, such as the above layers of management of a given organization, that brought us to where we are, such as to when we behave as urgent beings. In fact, we brought ourselves there as our success made a new world that we are into - the world of abundance of tools, resources, information, and the hyper-fast potential of a network. 

And this situation, which is undeniably good - and that is the problem - actually sets a challenge ahead of entrepreneurs, such as if you consider that an arbitrary entrepreneur might not see an inferno ahead, a so clear reason to free the world, and more importantly to the context of our book, so clear reason to execute entrepreneurship differently. In other words, if we are running along, or rolling, in the pace of the corporate sphere, anb in the pace of the urgent and networked world, we may have no reasons to break through, to think through, to break the norm, to break the speed, to break automatic responses, and so on. And this becomes a major complication for us, entrepreneurs or anyone that cares about them, and anyone who cares about humanity, because the environment of our success gives the means, such as an inclusive, or easy, or cheap, or acessible, of supporting an arbitraty entrepreneur such as one in a hurry, to just jump into actions, as if they had a "Jump to Conclusions Mat" where they can jump to.

### 5. General situation for the Book

- Punch - there is a need to pull the handbrake.
- Punch - Watch out for the "need for speed" and escape the "land of confusion."
- Referencing Maslow, the enlightened being may not follow the environment blindly. 
- We now can get then, data, tools, and flow to be more conscious in entrepreneurial movements.
--> 


Therefore, I rather pull the hand brake and invite us to take another turn, and to consider that our need for speed drives us into a land of confusion that harms work in general, that harms us as entrepreneurs, that harms us as human beings, therefore the development of humanity. 


> *"The danger that I see is the resurgence, in new and more sophisticated forms, of the old identification of psychological health with adjustment, adjustment to reality, adjustment to society, adjustment to other people. That is, the authentic or healthy person may be defined not in his own right, not in his autonomy, not by his own intra-psychic and non-environmental laws, not as *different* from the environment, independent of it or opposed to it, but rather in environment-centered terms, e.g., of ability to master the environment, to be capable, adequate, effective, competent in relation to it, to do a good job, to perceive it well, to be in good relations to it, to be successful in its terms. To say it in another way, the job-analysis, the requirements of the task, should not be the major criterion of worth or health of the individual. There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

Thus the focus area in our book comes down to reflecting on this accelerated pace that entrepreneurs might fit and how it impacts everything precisely at in the moment that we need energy, like willpower, and good ideas, and the right conditions to move on and achieve growth as individuals and for our organizations. What stands before us is the prioritization of the startup foundation, in the opposed direction where the end justifies the means. 




Beyond what seems to be a narrative pushing for accelerated effort, the fast-paced mode of execution has also infiltrated the context of management analysis and planning. Things have not sped up simply because people are running more, working more intensively, or because managers coordinate the frantic pace because they enjoy it. The fast mode is supported by functions, or resources, that are “ready” and available at hand.

--> 


In the modern reality of the knowledge worker, data have come to be used as tools, as mechanisms to accelerate decisions. The former CEO of Intel, Andy Grove, in "Arguing with Data," warned [^grovefastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people should argue their debates with data already in hand (GROVEDATA, p.116).

--> 

[^grovefastdata]: In Andy Grove's book, "Only the Paranoid Survive," the quoted phrase in English reads, “Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It’s good advice. All too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis.” The warning applies to what he termed a "Strategic Inflection Point," situations so adverse and unexpected that they befuddle companies. Intel survived crises of this magnitude and later also became a leading player. In these situations, the anticipatory data can be misleading.

In Technology, Management, and Society, Peter Drucker has contextualized that the situation of information abundance does impact effective communications which was stressed as the kind of communication where the receiver effectively understand and collaborates, as opposed to passively accept the message: 

> *"More and better information does not solve the communication problem, nor does it bridge the communication gap. On the contrary, the more information the greater is the need for functioning and effective communication becomes. The more information available, in other words, the greater is the communications gap likely to be. The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and application, that is, on communications. In the second place, the more effective the information process, the more impersonal and formal will it become, the more will it separate human beings and thereby require separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the human relationships, the relationship of communication. It may be said that the effectiveness of the information process will depend increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of effective communication - that is, in the present situation - the information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can produce is data."*

This form of operating decisions — with data — provokes us to reflect upon what can apparently look like a mechanization of cognition, which runs together with the the pressure of greater efficiency at work. The presence of data becomes concrete, providing people with "good data" which supports good reasons when faced with a decision that needs to be made. Data captivate us, certainly, because they work so well, when they do work.

* outline - introduction, answer 2 - All is interactive and iterative, systems, networks, platforms.  
--> 

In the interconnected and turbulent world, experts are constantly under pressure to provide "faster" and more modern solutions for things they are already familiar with. Why send individual emails when you can send a million at once? It seems as though all available solutions appear useful and efficient. Additionally, in this chaotic environment, when you seek assistance, it’s not hard to find a multitude of resources available that, in one way or another, say "yes, I can help." These resources are experts in their fields, ready to execute what they know, showcasing their expertise. A programmer who codes faster, an engineer who calculates more quickly. The tools are more automated, and they deal with more data, or live data, and are readily available, and it leads to one click decision-making. Amidst this immediate availability of models, it’s easy to get swept up in the current—let’s face it—and choose solutions that promise quicker delivery among the options, without reconsidering the strategy of the process itself.

Being an action in the language, the availability of data, and tools that are now connected with data, an inertial force conveniently asks us to continue on that highly performant execution path - precisely because the external reference point, for navigation, is ignored. In this world, where speed can accelerate any specialty, we are led to believe that we can move even faster, even if we make mistakes or take a detour. Failing faster and learning is a theme that makes sense. 

However, reflection is necessary and important, as getting to the wrong place faster not only means delay but also implies the consumption of energy, resources, willpower, and motivation. Therefore, it can't be said that entrepreneurs will promptly jump into the action, the data, and the tools that support flow decisions; exactly because anyone willing to engage in entrepreneurship is now equipped with stories, methods, and systems that are made for entrepreneurs. Therefore, there is an ecosystem of entrepreneurship available which does cover the theme specialists vs. generalist. This goes back to Drucker's thought about the excess of information, it only requires more from us. And the solution gone haywire which generally chimes in - likely one to tell you what to go, a plug and play something, a framework for that too.

* outline - introduction, answer 3 - Comes decision making, lean induction, generalist-specialist [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 

The renowned Steve Blank has acknowledged and addressed a fundamental issue with startups when he revealed a vision he had in 2014. According to Steve, the precursor idea of the lean movement is that entrepreneurs think their ideas can be materialized as smaller versions of large companies. Steve states that "startups are not smaller versions of large companies," emphasizing the difference between a startup and an established company. He notes that a startup is in the discovery phase, which differs from a large company that has already identified its role in the market and has a validated product. When ideas are not validated, operating as if it were a large company is dangerous and risky since the young company is in the process of discovery and has limited resources for betting. 

By now, much about this subject (not operating as a large company and recognizing the discovery phase) exists in startup literature and is also present in the world of platforms, methodologies, and startup structures. But now a decade later us running with the lean startup movement, and the whole entrepreneurial ecosystem, grew in size so there is literally a sea of solutions to be used by entrepreneurs, that puts them in a position to be harassed by specialized solutions - likely driven by a specialized mindset. We are not being called to embrace being specialized generalists. All of this sets us in a high-performance cockpit of startup development where it seems applicable to run on a great high-speed road of innovation. It is all one-click to do, it is all "plug-and-play". It's beautiful.

The key problem is that these are now connected, and lean leads to decision making. They are now essentially subject to being trapped by using lean, claiming to use lean, which is essentially in a business of closing the wrong gap. They enter closing the gap of validation, so they bring equilibrium for advancing as specialists. 

Frameworks, platforms, and all sorts and supporting systems - accelerators, incubators, networking and funding platforms, are all part of the richer landscape which also sets them to pass by valid data. When a team decides to join, in the pressure to advance, a bootcamp, enroll in an incubator, dive into an accelerator, participate in a contest, and other participations with collaboration that promisses potential results that would perhaps sling them into even faster growth. These are situations that promise acceleration and claim to solve the entrepreneur's journey. 













<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - introduction, Complication, answer - Generalist decision-making gone haywire 
--> 

Can we blame abudance of options? No one is being forced, we know. So we can't blame abundance plus too that all good exciting new things are being done by the building blocks given, in a way or another. Still, the reality is that in the rush to act by these productive instincts, they scramble to seek solutions that they think are things that startups do. Similarly, entrepreneurs might, in their urgent processes, flee as followers of a mechanized and known corporate behavior - or a general cultural that grow ups do. It's not even a thin line to miss the point about misusing lean methods, it's generally a straight line to be thirsty for validation (about anything), to be immersed in lean processes at the risk of being enamored with the processes, which can be observation by the self promotion and self satisfaction of being advancing by practicing lean while their actions may be about actually procrastinating using lean.

When we are hungry for the breakfast and in front of the all-you-can-it buffet, with solutions for everything for all the phases of growth, the crew feels empowered to pick more. And worse of all, taken from the beauty of all, entrepreneurship rises from a hungry spirit, on one hand, and on the other entrepreneurship demands the crew to accept that digestion problems are part of the course. Thus, entrepreneurship calls for growth and growth supports call to action, such as to eat more and to shop more.

* outline - introduction - Answer - book's intention 
--> 

This book is about procrastination disguised as entrepreneurial action, that looks like getting things done. Then it's about courage to use time to balance our views. Then it's about permission to work in what matters beyond the known matters of what appears to matter, then it's about and self-respect, which accounts our energy. 

It takes courage to see productivity as procrastination. It takes permission to see through, through new goggles, to believe that something really great can be found by not being a controller. And self-respect because entrepreneurship recognizes the doer that is not a know-it-all, recognizes that the real A comes from Fs and not from Bs. It's not necessarily about joining the club because the beat seems to be the "beat of the moment." The greatest abuse an entrepreneur can commit is when they start to sacrifice who they are and see them through the eyes of the system - to shape a professional identity. From that they fail to comply with their own values, with the well-being, and with their ability to discover what they are essentially doing. It takes them to confusion, or into a fusion, and from that to produce far too many outcomes to their selves, to their colleagues, to the future of their corporations. It costs them.

In other words, we aim a strategy that ceases to be reactive or speed-oriented from the pressures clamoring for results. Thus we will set themselves to avoid resorting to abuses that form a toxic culture centered where the end justifies the means. In such a culture, work dances with the bursts of motivational incentives, while possible signs of an environment detrimental to the work itself and the development of the team's work methodology are silenced. The strategy cannot be reduced to just going with the flow, by following the shadows of the world’s accelerated pace. We don’t just want speed, to run for the sake of running. On the contrary, execution and effort is meant to set us to be learners again, to start again, to renew our views, to gain perspective. Thus, we are into a mission for leaning about growth, as individuals and as leaders of our organizations. By doing so, we create a learning organization, which is one of the goals of this reflection and opportunity. 

Therefore, we bring situations, complications, and reflections that were not designed as recipes, as ready-made solutions to solve the adversities and complexities of the urgent mode. The idea is to strengthen, or to recover, or to keep alive, the entrepreneurial side of the entrepreneur — so that when you are confronted with chaos, and pressure, and a "normal" crazyness at work which is incessantly urgent and rarely seen as toxic and that is actually presented as a price to pay, or the norm, for success. In this sense, Fried and Hansson [^basecampcrazy] invite us to reflect:

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried and Hansson are the founders of Basecamp, a well-known company from Silicon Valley focused on productivity. In the book "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," they argue that it is necessary to work against the industry's toxic instincts and norms that avoids the possibility of managing a company calmly. The expression "It's crazy at work" is used by them to describe a work environment where pressure, such as excessive working hours, and consequences like anxiety, are the norm; and they reject this idea in favor of a calmer and more balanced work environment.

> *"Infelizmente, administrar uma empresa de maneira tranquila não é o modo padrão de gerir uma empresa atualmente. Você precisa ir contra seus instintos por um tempo. Você precisa deixar de lado as normas tóxicas da indústria. Você precisa reconhecer que 'É loucura no trabalho' não está certo."* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 9, tradução nossa).

In other words, our strategy does not involve selling out the human being as part of the process, discarding our greatest resource. This idea necessarily creates a force, or principle, of self-respect. It sets boundaries for the well-being for the entrepreneur which I regard as the highest investment and the actual only real way to navigate through the startup environment and into growth. This will be our guiding principle for many of the reflections through the three parts to come.

In part one, through *Urgency of the Self*, to support our conscious attitude for the road ahead, the road of growth of the startup which we assume that can only be achieved by self growth under the tenet that we are not expendable, that we value our beings and that who we are as entrepreneurs matches who we are as human beings - that everyone is an entrepreneur and that the role developed by entrepreneurship is not an indentity that is used for a business which is separated from us as a whole. We look at who we are, we value who we are, so that we can respect ourselves through the navigation that may set us into traps, into a disconnect. Through this part we go from key elements of who we are and straightly reflecting about our situation in the middle of the environment, through the inclination for running, through the journey of impact. Above all, we check on ourselves rather than to look for the external. Although the startup journey can't be controlled, our invest relies in observations and reflections about us doing it in ways that are less frustrating, less confusing, less arbitrary, and more fruitful, minimally in terms of the being conscious about our best selves which is key for the road ahead.

Through the second part, *Urgency of the Team*, we extent our reflections to improve the health of the team dynamics as it improve its collaboration. We start by considering how the urgent rises from execution and the challenging space this creates for keep the conscious view of purpose, such as how we start to fail with our entrepreneurial characterizations and entrepreneurship well-being causing the entrepreneurial function to lag behind, or be obfuscated by the movement of progress. We give special consideration for the dynamics that are given by applicability of lean movements and how teams generally think they are advancing but actually building up a great level of disconnection from their purpose. We wrap this part by valuing communication not as a communication serving the purpose of goals, like a tool, but a view for communication that serves for the growing the team in the first place. 







<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - introduction - part  - systems  
--> 

We complete the book through *Urgency in the system*, considering general elements that affects teams organization-wide ways. We recognize that the growth up and productive state of an organization demands a goal system that needs to be efficient. To that, we ask of our goal management efforts to being flexible, to be conscious, to be honest. As a final reflection, we will consider the beautiful and powerful world of narratives that involves celebrating how we get to do amazing things quick - such as to pull effort from humans - but too why to never do it without being conscious and aware of the dynamics of how our narrative systems influences control in ways we are not aware - given by voices through platforms, networks, systems, tools, technologies - by its own inherantly powerful characterizations if we assume ourselves as Homom narrans. 










This is a book for everyone who supports entrepreneurs, but particularly for those who care about them and are concerned with their health and their psychological well-being; hence for those who do not think that entrepreneurs are expendable. They are the ones in the arena, and it is a complicated space, full of urgencies and a fast-paced nature, which could prompt them into action and a natural inclination to miss the space for evaluating themselves. Thus, it becomes a book for entrepreneurs themselves as naturally, they will likely be alone at times, and will bear the responsibility to grow themselves, to learn and adapt from experiences. Being open, and involved, into an enlightenment should be acknowledged as part of entrepreneurship. This is especially necessary as entrepreneurs are expected to be in a position to change reality, to free themselves from the normal way things are done, which requires adapting and changing themselves. Entrepreneurial action invites new management.

Now it is even funny that the pro and corporate world can even make it sound nice even when shit hits the fan, when the situaton would get to the "folks, we didn't do well," the pro world too brings the spirits back and planes back on track. As long as there is life in this park, the adventure won't stop. A sign in the lobby reads "When Dinousaurs Ruled the Earth," reaffirms they are okay in the middle of that colorful and chaotic world of beasts and not so broken broken things being improved. And if anyone insists in taking things too seriously - looking around or suspecting that the whole park is a mess - the actual hallways are there too to remind them, to bring back the colorfulness and the soft drink dispensers and premium quality ice cream which is a reminder that all of that is supported by the monumental investment of a charismatic investor who spared no expenses. They will protect us to keep the park running. Our motto says that "it's fun to work". Here we do not take life so serious anyway.
