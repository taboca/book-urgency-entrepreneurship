--> 


This is a book about getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]. Now, I know that this is a pretty strong statement for a book entitled *Slow Down to Start Up*. So I won't go as far to say that this is the fastest way to get things done, and specifically to the context of founders trying to do startups. But when I wrote this statement and thought about the really fast way to get things done, it came to my mind that there are good and fast or lucky ways - such as when winning bets, not to say gambling, or on the other hand, when value is captured directly, when one picks the opportunity passing by. This also leads me to think about that success and impact can be either created or taken, designed and made or captured.

[^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]: The theme of getting things done have sometimes created confusion to me when I thought about innovation and impact. Because I first thought that getting things done for the sake of getting things done may be arbitrary and appears to be about a waste of resources. The view of Schumpeter helped me to be calmer, because he simplified, under the perspective that in a dynamic world of exchanges it appears a necessity for effiency and from comparison among similar ways to get things done people pick more efficient ones. And from that creative new things solves their problems in new ways, as in 10x more effient, this connects with the idea of creative destruction. 

From another view, if we were at a crossroad, take right to take or the left to make, ours is not the one that seems to be the right way, or faster or closer. Although ours appears the longer way, it does carry a value that characterizes our relationship, that founders are not expendable. We'll get back to that, but in short I want you to be around, not only through this reflective moment of reading, but also throughout the path of your startup and your startup throughout the path of the world. All of us to last.

Now, as we take that path, the slower or the calmer which I like to call the conscious, we are certainly acknowledging that the movement of getting things done requires founders to learn as they go. As in, to learn the skills to do what needs to be done. However, this learning is not only about the founder because the well-being of the organization is essentially required to follow along. To elaborate on that, we should pick a start-up definition; and a good one which connects with our fundamental principles aligned with this book is the one from Paul Graham where the start-up means growth:

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of "exit." The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.*" (Graham, Paul., 2012)

--> 

Now there's something observable right there, by that fragment, if we just take that picture and pass it on like the old telephone game, which would take us to misunderstand his invitation through growth [^foonote_paulgraham_startup_growth]. But a strong constraint is given by the saying that "everything else we associate with startups follows from growth." If we accept this idea as required, we will inevitably set us into reflections, such as the ones in *Startup = Growth* (2012) which also aligns with other reflections he wrote, like *Do Things that Don't Scale*." In other words, this frame set us to consider what is the conscious founder and a conscious team and the conscious startup situation that actually, in fact, brings about real growth. This framing aligns with other considerations for the dynamics between founders and startups with the market. One in special is given by the Blitzscaling model brought by Chris Yeh and Reid Hoffman, which starts from the view of growth too although sets a breakdown by stages - family, tribe, village, city and nation - which again essentially invite us to organize and into the discussion and to reflect about the other characterizations in terms of what it takes. As an example, from the Blitzscaling lecture 18, an interview with Brian Chesky (the CEO of Airbnb), he had put in perspective the learning challenges throughout these stages - for a founder that is around throughout all the stages - as one that is not about developing a skill continuously but essentially about having to learn something complete new, like a whole new sport. We'll come back to Brian in further chapters. But right now, to think about what it takes through these stages takes me to think that of a path of evolution, so I see the biological process for a butterfly.

[^foonote_paulgraham_startup_growth]: Paul Graham's definition of startup equals to growth is used here, although to do it fast might confuse me, on what that means; while I become calmer when observing Paul Graham's article entitled *Do Things that Don't Scale* and other ideas where essentially fast means the find conscious ways of growing.

@outline - Complicated situation - Abundant world, interactions, confusion. Intro to mechanized founder. 
--> 

When I look to a holistic view - a growth curve if you will - and consider the learning challenges, it comes to my mind a saying from Reid Hoffman which he carries in his pocket and says that essentially a founder jumps off a cliff and tries to assemble an airplane on her way down. When I sum some nuanced observations from Blitzscaling or Brian, and think about the evolution of the butterfly, it takes me to see the challenge as of one that jumps off a cliff,  tries to assemble an airplane on the way down, and assembles it, and then is prompted to learn how to fly, and as it does, and then it's prompted to know where to go, and so on.

Although this frames the situation for what this book is about, the special reason for us to be here has to do with something that has changed on our way. It may be since the industrial revolution, and over the years, but now might be a source of concern. This is our space, the space where we do things. Because our world is hotter, bigger, faster, we have lots of things, in terms of solutions, things to go for doing it, that are interactive or iterative. These things, solutions, and here and there to help our ways but they can be overwhelming or confusing, we know that. And dealing with that is not only important to the young, but also to the experienced founders, and quite applicable to experienced leaders in major and grown-up organizations. In this bigger world, with its abundance of solutions, there are just too many things now teasing us, not to say bombarded, by their packages and voices. Again, we know that. An we know too that these aren't there to bring us trouble. So we know that they are not evil, at least that a lot of things aren't, to some or a greater extent, that they are valid and applicable to specific conditions. Because these are the things that solve real problems, and these are the tools or the building blocks, and many are cheap and easy to plug in and quite important too. And sometimes security is fantastic and other things are quite required.


But we are teased to check them, teased to taste, or to buy, or to pick and unbox them. We can be involved with these things which can be good - ideas, tools, and methods - no doubt. And on top, or on the side, or underneath, there are the beings, like us or different, but anyway involved. They are the practitioners, or advisors, or experts, you name it. So they care, with us, they are not indifferent. When I look to all of that, if I sum all I see, I see superpowers. But no superpower from this environment seem to be as powerful as the power of not being alone. Especially when we start, an idea also reflected by Sam Altman, that founders are lonely. But there is more on our ways, a particular thing can be the platforms. When I picture myself in that fall trying to assemble my airplane, or to control it, I don’t see these platforms falling. Relativelly, I see a sort of carrier, fully equipped, and its roads for taking off. And then we hear the calls, their voices, which I can't say that are enchanting, because a lot I hear seem to be solid narratives. I see coherence.




















<!--
* @outline - Complication - The getting things done implies in specialized movement first, and it feels great. And that sets the complication of change, as comparative analysis. Although ambitions for entrepreneurial action is widespread, the outcomes as in to innovate, are driven by execution first; tied to the environment. Which seems not in alignment with entrepreneurial action which refuses the environment. Corporations, specialists, expenddable, Guacamole, means lower investment in training. But effects of new training are coming in other ways, through methods that does the job of the learning. We are not required to evolve ourselves.  
-->




Now to consider that dynamic and busy world influencing (our path for getting things done) we may consider an inductive movement, one which is action-oriented or perhaps one which creates a language of action. This may be intrinsic and driven by that abundance. In other words, we're compelled to be busy with execution. But it's one which in the modern view does not ignore learning. As an example, we may consider the corporate world and how learning is being carried over through the actual execution. Considering the spending in training in comparison with other execution investments. In the 2018, in a summit entitled *The Future of Talent - Transcending Work*, (Global Silicon Valley, 2018) Rob Biederman, the then CEO of Catalant Technologies, highlighted an intriguing aspect of corporate spending priorities, pointing that a large company which likely the audience were shareholders, allocates less budget per employee on training than his own startup spends on avocados.

That view can certainly show part of the problem, although we cannot infer that on the other side execution is merely execution that doesn't care about innovation or doesn't care about learning. That is not the case. Therefore, if we consider the many processes and that businesses are essentially wishing to innovate, certainly by the necessity of the environment and the competitive forces minimally; which can be observable as it shows clearly that there are elements or methods and the building blocks following goals, aspirational goals to innovate, and by that using means, like design thinking or many lean methods, and others intended for that. In other words, our businesses welcome innovation, they want to innovate, while they do so by creating a normal work routine which certainly carry ties with the control organization that is in need to organize and attempt to execute all of that as normal work, which may lead to business as usual if possible. In other words, the creative brain of corporations are somewhat controlled, not to say mechanized or automated, which is not an absurd as indeed they're trying to automate it - if that were possible. If that may be a problem or not for some organizations and corporations, we might take that aside as a consideration which might be applicable to us.










This setting may set us to wonder if these characterizations are brought in realm of the entrepreneur of the modern day - characterizing the beginning, the early stage of startup too, and if there are ties from the beginning causing the later situation too. In other worlds, does the environment - given by data or knowledge and tools or process and methods for deciding causes pressure or to influence the movement of getting things done to be somewhat controlled or inducing decision making, and moreover to a point where founders miss the conscious view? Now, to provoke ourselves, would it be the case that an intrinsic element of entrepreneurship or the founder - or the artist - that is not 100% taken by normal ways of execution, may be taken of clouded by methods, or mechanized or automated, ways for executing entrepeneurship? Setting them not to be involved in breaking the rules of the environment and furthermore too involved in what appears tobe breaking the rules of the environment by doing so in synergistic ways given by the environment? To support this, we may consider a thought from Maslow in *Toward the Psychology of Being*:

> *"The danger that I see is the resurgence, in new and more sophisticated forms, of the old identification of psychological health with adjustment, adjustment to reality, adjustment to society, adjustment to other people. That is, the authentic or healthy person may be defined not in his own right, not in his autonomy, not by his own intra-psychic and non-environmental laws, not as *different* from the environment, independent of it or opposed to it, but rather in environment-centered terms, e.g., of ability to master the environment, to be capable, adequate, effective, competent in relation to it, to do a good job, to perceive it well, to be in good relations to it, to be successful in its terms. To say it in another way, the job-analysis, the requirements of the task, should not be the major criterion of worth or health of the individual. There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

What this sets to us is the possibility to consider, as in moving toward the psychology of the founder, or toward the psychology of the entrepreneur, the ways in which the whole environment does act on us. Moreover, Maslow's consideration, his worries from early 1960s, can serve as a prompt to wonder how the world solutions take us, indeed in perhaps sophisticated forms. Let us then recount some of the thoughts or considerations of the transformations happening in the world affecting management - evidently observable in the corporate space first - but nevertheless considerations that may well set a mode of work by the cultural work norms for every single being that wants to get things done.

* outline - introduction, answer 1 - situation of data and information improving - feat. Peter Drucker of data  
--> 

As our modern reality is paved by the knowledge worker; it's been a while that great minds had brought up some concerns about the knowledge elements influencing our decisions. This former CEO of Intel, Angy Grove, in *Arguing with Data*, warned [^footnote_andygrove_fastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people entered into a thiking where they should argue their debates with data right in hand. In alignment with Andy's observations and reflections, Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, is known for his concern helping management in general to be aware and conscious that people lie with data and that they don't do so because of necessary evil of intention, but in part to please audiences [^footnote_jeff_lie_data], which may be inferred and it's clearly observed that it's part of a phenomenon where we're essentially being both controllers or controlled by the very presence of data.

[^footnote_andygrove_fastdata]: In Andy Grove's book, *Only the Paranoid Survive*, the quoted phrase in English reads, “Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It’s good advice. All too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis.” The warning applies to what he termed a "Strategic Inflection Point," situations so adverse and unexpected that they befuddle companies. Intel survived crises of this magnitude and later also became a leading player. In these situations, the anticipatory data can be misleading.

If an objection din't cross your mind, I'll throw the stone as in to say "hold your horses! are you telling me that more data and more information, as in passively available, does worse than no information at all and managing with guesses?" Maybe yes, maybe no. We are essentially considering that. Certainly there's no evil in passive data and knowledge available. But we are considering that there's something in us, from our willingness to use it and to engage with it, that might actually take us into that space of confusion - one which we may not even see as in when we become followers of a passive-aggressive movement. In *Technology, Management, and Society*, Peter Drucker has contextualized a situation where information abundance does impact effective communication, which he highlights defining it as the kind of communication where the receiver actually understands and collaborates, as opposed to passive acceptance of the message:

> *"More and better information does not solve the communication problem, nor does it bridge the communication gap. On the contrary, the more information the greater is the need for functioning and effective communication becomes. The more information available, in other words, the greater is the communications gap likely to be. The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and application, that is, on communications. In the second place, the more effective the information process, the more impersonal and formal will it become, the more will it separate human beings and thereby require separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the human relationships, the relationship of communication. It may be said that the effectiveness of the information process will depend increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of effective communication - that is, in the present situation - the information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can produce is data."*

@meta@outline - grade 5 - narrative rationality. 
--> 

Peter Drucker is essentially calling our attention to the importance of establishing potential shock-absorbers and consciousness in the face of an actual rise of elements which appears as information and the intrinsic disconnect from context, or as he pointed, impersonal or formal. This should prompt us to consider our ability to operate by decisions tied with the environment; and in special to reflect about the tools and systems that we have created throughout these years, tools for dealing with data, for pulling data, for querying data, for analyzing data, or dispatching data. That our tools, and systems, brought to us efficiency in terms of manipulating data, we know.  Moreover that the abundance of these building blocks can be quite meaningful in the right moment in time, as in that under the abundance it is possible to find good data that becomes good reasons for the narratives of decision-making in the collaborative environment-based communication. In other words, data captivate us because they may be so well ready in the right context and time. By induction, we follow, as we know that the right data in the right time supports a good narrative - we have seen it working. Thus, when the stars align, we may be teased to decide.














<!-- 
@meta @outline
* @meta@outline outline - @keyword - #tools 
* outline - introduction, answer 2 - All is interactive and iterative, systems, networks, platforms.  
--> 



Now it's been a while that we are acquainted with tools for dealing with data, like the tools to pull data or tools to dispatch data. And because data is valued, or that we value things through data, these tools become valuable by induction; like a shovel that is seen as value because it is know for its potential efficiency to dig, as in to find gold if we dig in history. Similarly, why to send an individual email if one can send a million at once? Why to pull and pick data by hand data if one can deal with millions of records? Thus, comparatively, there's certainly pain or latent need for these tools given that the others, like the competition, might be using them for doing it. From that it comes too a need for seeking assistance to access and use these things. Thus, in order to understand its meaning before decisions, we go to the experts, the people that know how to use these tools, which are certainly, generally, people that are passionate about technologies and tools. In other words, there's a programmer, or an expert in data, or an engineer who calculates quickly by operating a special kind of calculator. He or she who knows knows how to manipulate, thus they become important, and then in a way gatekeepers for tools. Moreover, they are incentivized and seen as valuable by the simple fact they manipulate the data. On an extreme point of view, we incentivize them to get busy with these tools and skills, also because these tools are being developed very fast and they gotta keep up to it, mostly up to date with the latest tools or trends. And with that, they might be less involved in looking from above, or to bother to check the contrarian view, or to consider the view of purpose, or to see things from perspective. In other words, not that they're comfortable with tools, but they're busy with looking at the tools methods of using and its evolution. Certainly, their tools are not arbitrary. Thus, in a way or another, these tools will always get better even if many of them are getting there by trial and error. This circles back to a possibility of a strategy induced by the movement by an assumption that experts in tools are experts (valued to support decisions) while they may be in fact be reduced to becoming tools themselves.

* outline - introduction, answer 3 - Comes decision making, lean induction, generalist-specialist [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 



We're certainly here looking at the grown-up world and wondering if it's all interconnected. If that data and knowledge and information and tools are essentially in fact entering the space of entrepreneurs and their startup situations. And moreover, more than that, if decision-making is actually induced by methods and the implications of using them. In this context, we may consider the concerns from Steve Blank, the father of the lean movement, when he addressed the fundamental issues with startups since 2014. His vision that entrepreneurs think that their startups are smaller versions of large companies and since he kept alert and conscious about that. He kept on reminding them that startups are not smaller versions of large companies. He kept reminding them that they essentially are in the discovery phase. Discovery phase. One take away. It's clear. If you really go into the lean methodology you'll see good principles and solid principles. And the lean leader is always present and concerned about that. Asking us to keep an eye on the purpose. To keep learning. To keep aware. 


By now, a decade later, the lean movement have matured and is widely used by founders, and teams and startups, and also by corporations trying to innovate. We have a great deal of conversations, and reflections, about the potential uses and misuses of these methods. And certainly interesting considerations of the phenomenon from widespread use and the potentiality of the controller who - perhaps by the urge to get things done - enters the space of using this methods in ways aligned with the considerations from Andy Grove - of people arguing with data - and the reflections from Jeff Bezos' concern about people using data to please, which we may too consider the extremme of lying with data, although without intent. In fact, within the realm of lean, this is observable and discussed by these fathers of lean, such as the extreme which can be see as founders talking about using lean but not using, as in procrastinating with lean, or being enamorated with the process, and there are other ways to see that, but in general shows the pattern of founders involved in missing the view of purpose [^footnote_ericries_purpose].

[^footnote_ericries_purpose]: Eric Ries, the renowned author of *The Lean Start-Up* and *The Start-up Way* carries his concern with the situation when the view of purpose is lost even in organizations that can use the lean methods professionally. 

Now, we may characterize our complication in two levels, the potential extreme of us being trapped and too involved by these dimensions - like data, tools and methods - influencing our decisions, as in taking us to close gaps no matter what gaps, seeking validation for the sake of validation, or valuing methods that can validate, or an extreme as a way to keep the equilibrium that we are advancing, thus inducing us into becoming a specialist as in a specialized generalist. This extreme by the superpowers may set one to feel as certainly powerful, or becoming powerful, and with that powerfully dangerous. But the more nuanced and more important but different than this extreme situation is the actual intermediary situation of us being distracted. On this side, we may actually be involved in using our energy, our creative energy. This may too appear as a movement of execution characterized by significant trial-and-error  activities, certainly supported by the effiency of these solutions, but to the point it may take us to overfocus on that, or to take our attention which may for example take us to be movers that learn in retrospect, such as by post-mortem analysis if not using methods for analysis that may not even characterize post-mortem. In other words, using our energy and focus and setting ourselves out of being conscious, out of the position of one interested in acquiring different perspectives, not interested in shock-absorbing our views; thefore setting us out of that view from above that supports growth through evolution, which are evident for the whole situation of growth or the phases given by Blitzscaling but moreover it is implied that the one who does not care about evolving may miss the apparent minor moments, by the hour and by the day, where change is required for looking towards purpose.

-->


As we proceed throughout the three parts that follows we're not setting ahead of us a framework, or a recipe, necessarily, but bringing about situation, complications, reflections, as an opportunity to pause and reflect about ourselves, about our own movements; thus to recover the entrepreneurial spirit alive, to support us to go against normal craziness of work [^basecampcrazy], or call it the frenetic or the fast-paced ways. Moreover, we are supporting us as entrepreneurs and or founders or colleagues who aren't expendable. We're not discarding the greatest resource. Running the risk of committing a fault in the world of writers and quoting back part of the quote I just quoted before, I ask us to think again about an idea, to consider the psychology of the founder who indeed has to listen to the outer but should never give up listening to the inner too: 

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried and Hansson are the founders of Basecamp, a well-known company from Silicon Valley, in "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," argue that it is necessary to work against the industry's toxic instincts and norms that avoids the possibility of managing a company calmly. The expression "It's crazy at work" is used by them to describe a work environment where pressure, such as excessive working hours, and consequences like anxiety, are the norm; and they reject this idea in favor of a calmer and more balanced work environment.

In part one, through *Urgency of the Self*, to support our conscious attitude for the road ahead, the road of growth of the startup which we assume that can only be achieved by self growth under the tenet that we are not expendable, that we value our beings and that who we are as entrepreneurs matches who we are as human beings - that everyone is an entrepreneur and that the role developed by entrepreneurship is not an indentity that is used for a business which is separated from us as a whole. We look at who we are, we value who we are, so that we can respect ourselves through the navigation that may set us into traps, into a disconnect. Through this part we go from key elements of who we are and straightly reflecting about our situation in the middle of the environment, through the inclination for running, through the journey of impact. Above all, we check on ourselves rather than to look for the external. Although the startup journey can't be controlled, our invest relies in observations and reflections about us doing it in ways that are less frustrating, less confusing, less arbitrary, and more fruitful, minimally in terms of the being conscious about our best selves which is key for the road ahead.

Through the second part, *Urgency of the Team*, we extent our reflections to improve the health of the team dynamics as it improve its collaboration. We start by considering how the urgent rises from execution and the challenging space this creates for keep the conscious view of purpose, such as how we start to fail with our entrepreneurial characterizations and entrepreneurship well-being causing the entrepreneurial function to lag behind, or be obfuscated by the movement of progress. We give special consideration for the dynamics that are given by applicability of lean movements and how teams generally think they are advancing but actually building up a great level of disconnection from their purpose. We wrap this part by valuing communication not as a communication serving the purpose of goals, like a tool, but a view for communication that serves for the growing the team in the first place.

We complete the book through *Urgency in the system*, considering general elements that affects teams organization-wide ways. We recognize that the growth up and productive state of an organization demands a goal system that needs to be efficient. To that, we ask of our goal management efforts to being flexible, to be conscious, to be honest. As a final reflection, we will consider the beautiful and powerful world of narratives that involves celebrating how we get to do amazing things quick - such as to pull effort from humans - but too why to never do it without being conscious and aware of the dynamics of how our narrative systems influences control in ways we are not aware - given by voices through platforms, networks, systems, tools, technologies - by its own inherantly powerful characterizations if we assume ourselves as Homom narrans.

Now if we go back to what this book is about, and consider that when we are hungry for the breakfast or we enter that all-you-can-eat buffet or a hypermarket solutions, we will certainly feel empowered to pick things we want and perhaps the things we don't need too. In part driven or taken by the wish to deliver and succeed by the hour, in the real world of these doers, the problem goes back to effective communication or honest communication, exactly because under the abundance of data and tools and methods for deciding, there is certainly something that appears to be the right thing at the right moment, as in when the thing available becomes good data and good reasons that supports decisions. This book is about procrastination disguised as entrepreneurial action, that looks like getting things done. Then it's about courage to use time to balance our views. Then it's about permission to work in what matters beyond the known matters of what appears to matter, then it's about and self-respect. It takes courage to engage in an exercise to check if what appears to be productivity could be procrastination. It takes permission to see through, through new goggles, to believe that something great can be achieved by not being a controller. And it takes self-respect because entrepreneurship recognizes that the doer for any next challenge is not characterized by the known know-it-all of the prior stage. Now if we go back to that crossroad in front of what appears to be right, what we are actually prompting ourselves to put the crossroad there where it does not appear to have one. To be able to, as part of the work, to be conscious about not taking roads that appears to be right, so automatically.
