* @todo - p1 ( ) - In Introduction - Leading paragraph - On "getting things done" and "initial energy" against "slowness". On the first, leading paragraph, of the Introduction, I have started with "getting things done", and then saying and acknowledging that as a pretty strong statement. The prior elaboration had to do with an idea of some "faster" ways of doing it, as in gambling or to capture prizes. These can be valid but it may call the attention of the reader too far. In this review I consider that to be slow can be too daring in the face of the actual energetic movement; in other words because the team starts in energetic ways, with motivation, and inspiration, or vision, or passion, or you name it; And then they face a world that embraces them to work and supports it, a world given by a rich ecosystem that is also vibrant and which comes with call to actions, oriented to action first, and furthermore it is networked. Thus, surely, to think about slowing down, can sound counter productive, as a starter. @meta-refid 2345-9494-9494-4444

This is a book about getting things done [^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]. Now, I know that this is a pretty strong statement for a book entitled *Slow Down to Start Up*. So I won't go as far to say that this is the fastest way to get things done, and specifically to the context of founders trying to do startups. But when I wrote this statement and thought about the really fast way to get things done, it came to my mind that there are good and fast or lucky ways - such as when winning bets, not to say gambling, or on the other hand, when value is captured directly, when one picks the opportunity passing by. This also leads me to think about that success and impact can be either created or taken, designed and made or captured.

[^footnote_schumpeter_getting_things_done]: The theme of getting things done have sometimes created confusion to me when I thought about innovation and impact. Because I first thought that getting things done for the sake of getting things done may be arbitrary and appears to be about a waste of resources. The view of Schumpeter helped me to be calmer, because he simplified, under the perspective that in a dynamic world of exchanges it appears a necessity for effiency and from comparison among similar ways to get things done people pick more efficient ones. And from that creative new things solves their problems in new ways, as in 10x more effient, this connects with the idea of creative destruction. 

From another view, if we were at a crossroad, take right to take or the left to make, ours is not the one that seems to be the right way, or faster or closer. Although ours appears the longer way, it does carry a value that characterizes our relationship, that founders are not expendable. We'll get back to that, but in short I want you to be around, not only through this reflective moment of reading, but also throughout the path of your startup and your startup throughout the path of the world. All of us to last.

Now, as we take that path, the slower or the calmer which I like to call the conscious, we are certainly acknowledging that the movement of getting things done requires founders to learn as they go. As in, to learn the skills to do what needs to be done. However, this learning is not only about the founder because the well-being of the organization is essentially required to follow along. To elaborate on that, we should pick a start-up definition; and a good one which connects with our fundamental principles aligned with this book is the one from Paul Graham where the start-up means growth:

> *"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of "exit." The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.*" (Graham, Paul., 2012)

--> 

Now there's something observable right there, by that fragment, if we just take that picture and pass it on like the old telephone game, which would take us to misunderstand his invitation through growth [^foonote_paulgraham_startup_growth]. But a strong constraint is given by the saying that "everything else we associate with startups follows from growth." If we accept this idea as required, we will inevitably set us into reflections, such as the ones in *Startup = Growth* (2012) which also aligns with other reflections he wrote, like *Do Things that Don't Scale*." In other words, this frame set us to consider what is the conscious founder and a conscious team and the conscious startup situation that actually, in fact, brings about real growth. 

<!--

* @reference - Graham, P. (2012, September). Startup = Growth. Retrieved August 29, 2023, from http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html
--> 

This frame goes along with other considerations for the dynamics between founders and startups with the market. One in special is given by the Blitzscaling model brought by Chris Yeh and Reid Hoffman, which starts from the view of growth too although sets a breakdown by stages - family, tribe, village, city and nation - which again essentially invite us to organize and into the discussion and to reflect about the other characterizations in terms of what it takes. As an example, from the Blitzscaling lecture 18 (2015), an interview with Brian Chesky (the CEO of Airbnb), he had put in perspective the learning challenges throughout these stages - for a founder that is around throughout all the stages - as one that is not about developing a skill continuously but essentially about having to learn something complete new, like a whole new sport. Brian Chesky will come back to visit us in further chapters. But now, when I think about what he is saying through these stages, I think about a path that is more like an evolution. The evolutionary path that makes a butterfly.

[^foonote_paulgraham_startup_growth]: Paul Graham's definition of startup equals to growth is used here, although to do it fast might confuse me, on what that means; while I become calmer when observing Paul Graham's article entitled *Do Things that Don't Scale* and other ideas where essentially fast means the find conscious ways of growing.

In other words, we might think that there are levels of zoom applicable to describe these growth challenges or that growth curve situation. As an example, from far, Reid Hoffman carries a saying in his pocket that essentially describes a founder jumping off a cliff and trying to assemble an airplane on the way down. But them, the more I read from Reid Hoffman, and from the Blitzscaling crew such as Brian Chesky’s observations, it brought me to expand the metaphor (with that butterfly in my mind,) and describe the challenge as of one who jumps off a cliff, assembles an airplane on the way down, and, if they do well, then must learn how to fly; and, if successful and if it does fall, they are challenged to figure where to go.







<!--
@outline - World has changed 
--> 


This situation, which brought us here, by such brief effort analysis, does set that the challenges for the growth of the startup into a business are intertwined with the evolution given by learning and adaptability of their founders, naturally because the founders are key in terms of characterization of the future of the business. But that's not the main reason that we are here. The reason that we are here is because something has changed along the way, and likely or characteristically since the Industrial Revolution, and it's growing over the years. It's basically giving us the good and the bad news, but nevertheless a chance for a reflection.




Starting with the good news, this is our space. There is a space now for doing things because our world is bigger, our faster, therefore lots of solutions for doing it. All we have is interactive and iterative and we know that the many things there are there to help our ways. If to some extent they seem to be about the ways to work and get things done as part of general life, we know that, but it also grew bigger, given by tools and methods, and abundant and richer, in ways to support founders by the entrepreneurial ecosystem. It totally set new ways to start, or if you will to jump off that cliff - or into execution - by picking things in the air. 

Now, in this bigger world, generally experienced managers or experienced founders, and others like advisors who cares about them, and to some extent young founders, they're well acquainted that. In essence, what they do is to deal with the abundance of options and pick the tools and methods that matters for them. In other words, they do understand that, from abundance, they are in a quest, even if they're bombarded or teased by so many patches or voices; that what they do essentially has to do with the management of how to do it. In other words, we know that these things aren't evil, to some or a greater extent, because in the middle of this abundance there are many things that are applicable, methods or tools, advices, ideas, you name it; because we know that some of these, in fact, do solve real problems. These are building blocks, and some of them can be cheap, and others easy to plug, and security can be fantastic. If all is a valuable contribution, options seems to favor the wiser or the one doing it faster or doing it faster and better - some of these thoughts sound coherent. 

Now, one thing is to consider that to get into these affairs is part of the management of any entrepreneurial effort. That's okay and founders know, so we know. However, one way to generally solve this problem - if any exists which may be characterizes as to see signal from noise - is to actually interact with the environment, which gives them the other viewpoint, or you may call it shock-absorbing views. Basically, they do seek perspective, so not to be alone in a possible path leading to trouble without synchronicity with the outside; call it audiences, our customers, our partners or the industry dynamics, or the market. Thus, comparatively, in relative terms, we move towards growth by actually interacting with external environment. Founders and managers, experienced or fresh, know that to a more or less extent. 

However, and specifically to the situation of founders, we will also recognize that founders are lonely, or may start lonely, or find themselves in lonely places (this one we will get back to experienced founders and leaders will too find themselves in lonely places.) This idea that the startup situation is a lonely place may have to do with the very fact that what is baking, some new or bold idea, does not smell familiar, not until they haven't figured out how to put it in a way that the world gets it. About a decade ago in *Founder Depression* (2014), Sam Altman who is now widely known as the CEO of OpenAI, had reflected about that place: 

> *"Founders end up with a lot of weight on their shoulders—their employees and their families, their customers, their investors, etc.  Founders usually feel a responsibility to make everyone happy, even though interests are often opposed. And it’s lonely in a way that’s difficult to explain, even with a cofounder (one of the things that works about organizations like Y Combinator is that you have a peer group you can lean on for support)."* (Altman, Sam., 2014)

-->

There are so many other characterizations to that but one from Brian Chesky, also given by the Blitzscaling lecture 18 (2015) goes on to say that "all these really good ideas or big ideas often sound like stupid ideas," and that "don't worry about anyone stealing your idea. If it's any good, everyone will dismiss it."

* Quote - And, of course it turned out that the crazy little idea that we thought no one else would do, became the big idea. And I think there were a couple lessons there. Number one, all these really good ideas or big ideas often sound like stupid ideas. Somebody once told me in the early days, don't worry about anyone stealing your idea. If it's any good, everyone will dismiss it.

Now if we reconciliate this characteristic place with a world of the givens in front of us - such as ideas, tools and methods - besides the fact that options may keep us busy, no doubt; or creatively busy, no doubt; we will also take that these things are enriched by the richer ecosystem. So on top of them, or on the side, or underneath, there are beings which now acessible through the networked environment which we use to interact and iterate. These are the practitioners, advisors, experts, or you name, and comparatively other founders doing sort of the same and interacting with; which supports a richer and social environment where many others are together with us. In other words, they care therefore they are not indifferent. When I look at the situation, I certainly see these things giving us superpowers but no superpower is as powerful as the power of not being alone. In other words, if we look around, we see people using tools and people using methods and people giving advice. Plus, they also got better in terms of narratives and storytelling. But then, again, that's part of our challenge, isn't it? The challenge that we sort of know. Still, it's quite challenging, every day, by the networks, even to a point that we sometimes do not see from far and get taken by perspectives when we look to these things. If I were to mix Reid's clear thought with how the air looks for me, I can see that one now jumping off a cliff with many things in the air. And things of different categories - not only hammers and shovels falling, of course. One particular kind of thing are the platforms. So if I am there, trying to assemble that airplane on my way down, I see a platform somehow differently. I don't see a platform falling along. I see, relatively, a carrier. And it seems fully equipped and there's a nice road for landing and then taking off. But we know, there's a truth in there, and it's coherently given by so many of them platforms which are actually real. Comee one, they are really our ways to take off. So that's how the abundant world looks for founders which may be unfair to say that it's enchanting, or evil, but it is fair to consider that it's complex and can be confusing because we're going to feel embraced. By so many options, now with amazing narratives, with coherence, and actually in fact very good reasons for using for deciding.























<!--
* @outline - Complication - The getting things done implies in specialized movement first, and it feels great. And that sets the complication of change, as comparative analysis. Although ambitions for entrepreneurial action is widespread, the outcomes as in to innovate, are driven by execution first; tied to the environment. Which seems not in alignment with entrepreneurial action which refuses the environment. Corporations, specialists, expenddable, Guacamole, means lower investment in training. But effects of new training are coming in other ways, through methods that does the job of the learning. We are not required to evolve ourselves.

* @outline - complication - Learning for innovcation into the machine.  #BAU
--> 



Now, by this brief observation of the abundance we can surely be very busy in a world which invites us to do it by getting things done, first. Nevertheless, this world of execution - yet unfair to call it a land of confusion - is known as one where management of the entrepreneurial consists of evaluating these movements, by internal or external interactions, against achieving the goals. Nevertheless, we know that our values and goals are not 100% clear in the very beginning. That is why we should be thankful for an intrinsic human trait, which is the ability to learn, which is probably what we think of as our escape hatch from the potential traps of any induced movement - yet unfair to say that a founder or team can warp through the universe - that can take us to take our focus away or to burn too many resources and miss the view of purpose. 

In this context, learning, we consider how the world of work, or the corporate world, has improved, and is evolving in terms of ways where learning is carried over by the machine. Considering the spending in training in comparison with other execution investments. In the 2018, in a summit entitled *The Future of Talent - Transcending Work*, (Global Silicon Valley, 2018) Rob Biederman, the then CEO of Catalant Technologies, highlighted an intriguing aspect of corporate spending priorities, pointing that a large company which likely the audience were shareholders, allocates less budget per employee on training than his own startup spends on avocados. That view can certainly show part of the problem, although we cannot infer that learning equals to training since the the other, the side of execution, isn't about an execution that doesn't care about innovation or doesn't care about learning. That is not the case, the world has revolved there too. As an example, we should consider the many processes and that businesses are essentially using to innovate, certainly pushed by many factors such as the competitive forces which in more richer ways innovates with higher dynamics with users or customers, minimally. Along with that, we can clearly observe the many methods, positioned as building blocks to solve aspirational goals and innovate, to set the context we can think of the reach of methods like design thinking or lean methods into the corporate world [^footnote_lean_corporate]. In other words, our businesses welcome innovation, they want to innovate, while they do so by creating a normal work routine which certainly carry ties with the control organization that is in need to organize and attempt to execute all of that as normal work. It may be unfair to say that corporations are trying to innovate by doing business as usual, or to think that the creative brain of corporations are somewhat controlled, not to say mechanized or automated. On the other hand, if it were possible, corporations would seriously consider to automate it. If that is a problem, or not, for some organizations, we might take that aside for now and come back to how this circles back to us.

[^footnote_lean_corporate]: Both Steve Blank and Eric Ries, founders or fathers of the Lean Startup Movement, have accepted or embraced, in part, the challenge of or the requests of the corporate world that also wanted to innovate likely in the face of being out-competed by users themselves (by their startups.) An example, we may observe the demand for *The Start-up Way* (for corporations) from the *The Lean Start-up*. 












<!--
@outline - Question
--> 


Exactly because the very methods of innovating by using methods are both applicable in the startup space and the corporate space because they compete in the end of the day, this situation may then help us to set and prompt a question before us. In other words, does the environment given by data or knowledge and tools and methods for deciding causes pressures or influence our movement of getting things done in somewhat controlled ways or induced decision-making ways? as in in ways clouding our views? Or to not to be involved, or to be less involved anyway, with breaking the rules of the environment? And furthermore, to be involved in what appears to be "breaking the rules" of the environment but doing so in synergistic ways given by the very rich environment? To support this, we may consider a thought from Maslow in *Toward the Psychology of Being*:

> *"The danger that I see is the resurgence, in new and more sophisticated forms, of the old identification of psychological health with adjustment, adjustment to reality, adjustment to society, adjustment to other people. That is, the authentic or healthy person may be defined not in his own right, not in his autonomy, not by his own intra-psychic and non-environmental laws, not as *different* from the environment, independent of it or opposed to it, but rather in environment-centered terms, e.g., of ability to master the environment, to be capable, adequate, effective, competent in relation to it, to do a good job, to perceive it well, to be in good relations to it, to be successful in its terms. To say it in another way, the job-analysis, the requirements of the task, should not be the major criterion of worth or health of the individual. There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

Maslow thinking is not only a worth reflection but actually has here for us to support the characterization of this book. In other words, we are here to reflect about the psychology of the founder, or toward the psychology of the entrepreneur, such as to be thougtful about in which ways our beings get to grow or become defensive by the dynamics of this environment; and along to reflect about the consequences in terms of the well-being of our organizations with we know have direct implications in the well-being of our whole civilization. Maslow's consideration, these potential worries from early 1960s, is a prompt. It prompts us, to wonder, how this rich world solutions define us and define entrepreneurship, in, indeed, perhaps sophisticated forms.

--> 



Now, and since the prompt is from 1960, if I thought of myself as being a sort of AI robot, or tool, to give the answer, I would seem reasonable to hear what experienced or renowned leaders in management had considered about the corporate world transformations in the face of decisions tied with a richer system of information, or data, or tools, or methods. 

Let us start with data. The former CEO of Intel, Angy Grove, in *Arguing with Data*, warned [^footnote_andygrove_fastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people entered into a thiking where they should argue their debates with data right in hand. In alignment with Andy's observations and reflections, Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, is known for his concern helping management in general to be aware and conscious that people lie with data and that they don't do so because of necessary evil of intention, but in part to please audiences [^footnote_jeff_lie_data], which may be inferred and it's clearly observed that it's part of a phenomenon where we're essentially being both controllers or controlled by the very presence of data.

[^footnote_andygrove_fastdata]: In Andy Grove's book, *Only the Paranoid Survive*, the quoted phrase in English reads, “Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It’s good advice. All too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis.” The warning applies to what he termed a "Strategic Inflection Point," situations so adverse and unexpected that they befuddle companies. Intel survived crises of this magnitude and later also became a leading player. In these situations, the anticipatory data can be misleading.

If an objection din't cross your mind, I'll throw the stone and say to "hold your horses! are you telling me that more data and more information, as in passively available, does worse than no information at all and managing with guesses?" Maybe yes, maybe no. No, because they recognize data. Yes because they point that we are arguing with emotions. Certainly there's no evil in passive data and knowledge available. But we are considering that there's something in us, from our willingness to use it and to engage with it, that might actually take us into that space of confusion - one which we may not even see as in when we become followers of a passive-aggressive movement. In *Technology, Management, and Society*, Peter Drucker has contextualized a situation where information abundance does impact effective communication, which he highlights defining it as the kind of communication where the receiver actually understands and collaborates, as opposed to passive acceptance of the message:

> *"More and better information does not solve the communication problem, nor does it bridge the communication gap. On the contrary, the more information the greater is the need for functioning and effective communication becomes. The more information available, in other words, the greater is the communications gap likely to be. The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and application, that is, on communications. In the second place, the more effective the information process, the more impersonal and formal will it become, the more will it separate human beings and thereby require separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the human relationships, the relationship of communication. It may be said that the effectiveness of the information process will depend increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of effective communication - that is, in the present situation - the information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can produce is data."*

Peter Drucker were preparing us to creating consciousness in the face of an actual rise of elements which appears as information and the intrinsic disconnect from context; or as he pointed, impersonal or formal. This should prompt us to consider our ability to operate by decisions tied with the environment; and in special to reflect about the tools and systems that we have created throughout these years, tools for dealing with data, for pulling data, for querying data, for analyzing data, or dispatching data. Now, Peter and Andy had certainly seen and tasted a bit of that world but I don't think they experienced the whole enchilada. For now, it's been a while that we are acquainted with tools for dealing with data, like the tools to pull data or tools to dispatch data. And because data is valued, or that we value things through data, these tools become valuable by induction; like a shovel that is seen as value because it is know for its potential efficiency to dig, as in to find gold if we dig in history. Similarly, why to send an individual email if one can send a million at once? Why to pull and pick data by hand data if one can deal with millions of records? Thus, comparatively, there's certainly pain or latent need for these tools given that the others, like the competition, might be using them for doing it. From that it comes too a need for seeking assistance to access and use these things. Thus, in order to understand its meaning before decisions, we go to the experts, the people that know how to use these tools, which are certainly, generally, people that are passionate about technologies and tools. In other words, there's a programmer, or an expert in data, or an engineer who calculates quickly by operating a special kind of calculator. He or she who knows knows how to manipulate, thus they become important, and then in a way gatekeepers for tools. Moreover, they are incentivized and seen as valuable by the simple fact they manipulate the data. On an extreme point of view, we incentivize them to get busy with these tools and skills, also because these tools are being developed very fast and they gotta keep up to it, mostly up to date with the latest tools or trends. And with that, they might be less involved in looking from above, or to bother to check the contrarian view, or to consider the view of purpose, or to see things from perspective. In other words, not that they're comfortable with tools, but they're busy with looking at the tools methods of using and its evolution. Certainly, their tools are not arbitrary. Thus, in a way or another, these tools will always get better even if many of them are getting there by trial and error. This circles back to a possibility of an induced movement by communication where characterized perceptions of experts adds value to support decisions, which may in fact reduce people as becoming tools themselves.  That our tools, and systems, brought to us efficiency in terms of manipulating data, we know. Moreover that the abundance of these building blocks can be quite meaningful in the right moment in time, as in that under the abundance it is possible to find good data that becomes good reasons for the narratives of decision-making in the collaborative environment-based communication. In other words, data captivate us because they may be so well ready in the right context and time. By induction, we follow, as we know that the right data in the right time supports a good narrative - we have seen it working. Thus, when the stars align, we may be teased to decide.

@meta @Outline
* outline - introduction, answer 3 - Comes decision making, lean induction, generalist-specialist [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 



Now that the grown-up world is interconnected with the young (and hopeful inventive world) we know, so let us go back to our situation and wonder if that data and knowledge and information and tools are essentially in fact entering the space of entrepreneurs and their startup situations. And moreover, more than that and beyond the benefits of that which are widely addressed by now, to wonder if decision-making is actually induced by methods and the implications of using them. In this context, we may being again the father of the lean movement, and some observations from Steve Blank, one in particular which he addressed as a fundamental issue with startups since 2014. His vision, which connects with fundamental motivations to the whole movement, was that entrepreneurs think that their startups are smaller versions of large companies. Since then, Steve kept alert, and conscious, about that problem of a phenomenon. He kept on, reminding them, that startups are not smaller versions of large companies. He kept reminding them that they essentially are in the discovery phase. Discovery phase, that is one take away and it's clear from the beginnings. By now, a decade later, the lean movement have matured and is widely used by founders, and teams and startups, and also by corporations trying to innovate. We have a great deal of conversations, and reflections, about the potential uses and misuses of these methods. And certainly interesting considerations of the phenomenon from widespread use and the potentiality of the controller who - perhaps by the urge to get things done - enters the space of using this methods in ways aligned with the considerations from Andy Grove - of people arguing with data - and the reflections from Jeff Bezos' concern about people using data to please, which we may too consider the extremme of lying with data, although without intent. In fact, within the realm of lean, this is observable and discussed by these fathers of lean, such as the extreme which can be see as founders talking about using lean but not using, as in procrastinating with lean, or being enamorated with the process, and there are other ways to see that, but in general shows the pattern of founders involved in missing the view of purpose [^footnote_ericries_purpose].

[^footnote_ericries_purpose]: Eric Ries, the renowned author of *The Lean Start-Up* and *The Start-up Way* carries his concern with the situation when the view of purpose is lost even in organizations that can use the lean methods professionally.

#### Where we are going we don't need roads 





Now, we come up with some characterizations of consequences but just to structure a problem, in two levels, the potential extreme of us being trapped and too involved - like data, tools and methods and hugs or parties - influencing our decisions, as in taking us to close gaps no matter what gaps, seeking validation for the sake of validation, or valuing methods that can validate, or an extreme as a way to keep the equilibrium that we are advancing, thus inducing us into becoming a specialist as in a specialized generalist. This extreme by the superpowers may set one to feel as certainly powerful, or becoming powerful, and with that powerfully dangerous. But on the other level we may see an actual intermediary situation, perhaps more realistic, where are can be too involved in using our energy, our creative energy by navigating the space by trial and error, certainly supported by the effiency of this medium, but to the point it may could us to overfocus, or to take our attention away, such as from the view of perspective or purpose, which can take us to become movers by learning in retrospect, such as by post-mortem analysis, if not using methods for analysis that may not even characterize some of the fundamental ideas of post-mortem which involves releasing what you know. 

As we move on into reflections in this direction, I invite us to pause briefly to provoke ourselves with another question: Would it be the case that a way of doing entrepreneurship - as in business as usual - may affect our intrinsic element of entrepreneurship, or the founder, or of an artist, our ability to see through? Or, with the lenses from Blitzscaling, that our ways to learn how to learn can be sometimes clouded by a directed movement? But furthermore, is it really that a product of the environment or of us trying to capture the prize and becoming followers of perhaps all of that is us being safe and not corageus enough, or not believers of our capacity to do it?

As we proceed, the three parts that follows brings about some situation, complications, and considerations to bring about our reflections, as an opportunity to think through about who we are when we enter this journey. ourselves, about our own movements; thus to recover characterizations from the entrepreneurial spirit to support us to go against normal craziness of work [^basecampcrazy], minimally, or call it the frenetic or the fast-paced ways, which indeed might be to some extent connected with us not facing, honestly, the reality, and the scary situation which may set us to be defensive - such as defensivelly doing it as in performing. Running the risk of committing a fault in the world of writers and quoting back part of the quote I just quoted before, I ask us to think again about an idea, to consider the psychology of the founder who indeed has to listen to the outer but should never give up listening to the inner too: 

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried and Hansson are the founders of Basecamp, a well-known company from Silicon Valley, in "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," argue that it is necessary to work against the industry's toxic instincts and norms that avoids the possibility of managing a company calmly. The expression "It's crazy at work" is used by them to describe a work environment where pressure, such as excessive working hours, and consequences like anxiety, are the norm; and they reject this idea in favor of a calmer and more balanced work environment.

> *"There is not only an orientation to the outer but also to the inner. An extra-psychic centering point cannot be used for the theoretical task of defining the healthy psyche."* (Maslow, Abrahan., 2011, p.168)

In part one, through *Urgency of the Self*, to support our conscious attitude for the road ahead, the road of growth of the startup which we assume that can only be achieved by self growth under the tenet that we are not expendable, that we value our beings and that who we are as entrepreneurs matches who we are as human beings - that everyone is an entrepreneur and that the role developed by entrepreneurship is not an indentity that is used for a business which is separated from us as a whole. We look at who we are, we value who we are, so that we can respect ourselves through the navigation that may set us into traps, into a disconnect. Through this part we go from key elements of who we are and straightly reflecting about our situation in the middle of the environment, through the inclination for running, through the journey of impact. Above all, we check on ourselves rather than to look for the external. Although the startup journey can't be controlled, our invest relies in observations and reflections about us doing it in ways that are less frustrating, less confusing, less arbitrary, and more fruitful, minimally in terms of the being conscious about our best selves which is key for the road ahead.

Through the second part, *Urgency of the Team*, we extent our reflections to improve the health of the team dynamics as it improve its collaboration. We start by considering how the urgent rises from execution and the challenging space this creates for keep the conscious view of purpose, such as how we start to fail with our entrepreneurial characterizations and entrepreneurship well-being causing the entrepreneurial function to lag behind, or be obfuscated by the movement of progress. We give special consideration for the dynamics that are given by applicability of lean movements and how teams generally think they are advancing but actually building up a great level of disconnection from their purpose. We wrap this part by valuing communication not as a communication serving the purpose of goals, like a tool, but a view for communication that serves for the growing the team in the first place.

* outline - introduction - part  - systems

We complete the book through *Urgency in the system*, considering general elements that affects teams organization-wide ways. We recognize that the growth up and productive state of an organization demands a goal system that needs to be efficient. To that, we ask of our goal management efforts to being flexible, to be conscious, to be honest. As a final reflection, we will consider the beautiful and powerful world of narratives that involves celebrating how we get to do amazing things quick - such as to pull effort from humans - but too why to never do it without being conscious and aware of the dynamics of how our narrative systems influences control in ways we are not aware - given by voices through platforms, networks, systems, tools, technologies - by its own inherantly powerful characterizations if we assume ourselves as Homom narrans.

So we go back to what this book is about, and consider that when we are hungry for the breakfast or we enter that all-you-can-eat buffet or a hypermarket solutions, we will certainly feel empowered to pick things we want and perhaps the things we don't need too. In part driven or taken by the wish to deliver and succeed by the hour. In the real world of these doers, the problem goes back to effective honest communication, exactly because under the abundance of data and tools and methods for deciding, there is certainly something that appears to be the right thing at the right moment, as in when the thing available becomes good data and good reasons that supports decisions. This book is about be conscious about effects of movement which may be about procrastination but disguised as entrepreneurial action, that looks like getting things done. Then it's about courage to use time to balance our views, about permission to work in what matters beyond what appears to be what matters; so it's first about and self-respect. It takes courage to engage in an exercise to check in the face of what appears to be productivity. It takes permission to see through, through new goggles, to believe that something great can be achieved by not being a controller. And it takes self-respect because entrepreneurship recognizes that the doer for any next challenge is not characterized by the known know-it-all of the prior stage. Now if we go back to that crossroad in front of what appears to be right, the right ways known to us, we will set ourselves to be reflective, and to be prompting ourselves, to put that crossroad right there. This works for the inexperienced founders, sure; but too the experienced founders, or leaders, are too to be quite interested; since they are required to release from their know-it-all views in the face of challenges that will set them to be young again. So let us go, to engage with this, as part of work.
