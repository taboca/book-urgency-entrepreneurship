When an incidental voice says "let's slow down," in a modern-world workplace, it doesn't sound great. If the team pauses, they might wonder "why is it that we can't keep doing what we were doing?" On the other hand, the "let's speed up," sounds more plausible, although modern-world variations of "keep cranking" are not noisy and given by the smooth beat of digitalized thumbs ups and claps by the hour.

And that makes sense, doesn't it? That is how we keep the beat, how we sum our efforts, especially in the corporate situation that follows a somehow coherent movement that things are working, even when things aren’t. That goes with closing the gap, getting things done earlier, selling more, delivering faster, all things that in a way or another follows the wider rhythm of the competition, more or less eloquently or more or less mediocre.

The complication, on the other hand and in the heads of entrepreneurs, happens to be that thoughts of slowing down are generally felt as frustrating. In other words, it does not matter - this happens: That when we are caught opening the gap, and not getting things done sooner or selling less or delivering slower, and the like, we just don’t like it. And this is so because we are caught by that uncomfortable feeling. Now, we do know that founders or innovators have to be resilient, that they are aware of a world of uncertainty, that they need to be prepared for what does not look productive, or prepared to be wrong, initially certainly but as well throughout the growth path. And we know too, to be fair, that for many of them entrepreneurs that fear of failure, maybe a raw fear, does work as a kind of fear that drives growth, that takes them to move mountains.

But what we may not know, or feel, or fail to notice, is a feeling that happens on a by-the-hour basis, or real-time, now something that we might be quite used to. That feeling of sadness, into ourselves, into the self, felt grain by grain, to subtitle anyway to be noted. But apparent anyway from our needs to be constantly monitoring, constantly seeking to grab, constantly seeking validation. One which may materialize an inner system, a certain operating system of management; again perhaps fueled or teased or mirrored by that outer operating system of getting things done, the one that wants to feel great by those great things, the one which welcomes productivity; as in, as soon as possible.
But here we are worried, to our lives as founders and entrepreneurs of ourselves, living our own journeys, that that normal movement for grabbing what feels productive is not enough to bring out the great, for us, for the startup, and for the long term business, and for society. As for what we do out there, bargains rise as outcomes. For startups? They may pivot quickly into the first thing that seems to work. Some of them then fail and simply don't get why some weird competitor does it better. For the big corporations? It dies, by not having a way to change, or they acquire others to delay or in an attempt to import some new characterization of change. And for their leaders, they rather be replaced than to be seen as babies again.

But to ourselves, we can’t see what we pay for ourselves, running our projects or startups or our own lives like that. That we are too involved - by now - with that mechanized way of looking at life - constantly dispensing our attention, our focus, to that other part of the equation, welcoming greatness, even little great grains, grain by grain. As in, by the hour, or by the minute, and obsessively. But more than that, we can’t see that by that grain-by-grain movement we are taking us into a condition of saturation and missing living our journeys in ways connected with fundamental values. And by living that we too get, grain by grain, disconnected from our true potential.
