Para: barminto@aol.com
Cc: Adrian H Davies <adrianhdavies@yahoo.com>
Hi Barbara,

Since around the time that I had received a note from you - the note
is shown in the picture attached in a t-shirt I made as a reminder - I
was able to write consistently. By now, it's been 134 day episodes of
work, as a writer, or 402 hours.

This book is for entrepreneurs interested in more conscious
entrepreneurial behavior - especially under the complicated and modern
world with so many tools and systems and methods where a lot is urgent
or hyper accelerated and networked. The book was born because I was
trapped in this world and perhaps saw the light.

Among other chapters, I have two that connect with communications. One
of them is the one that makes references to you and your work. On the
personal side, I consider this chapter a thank you note to Barbara
Minto and Michael Dearing.

I wonder if I can send the copy of that chapter to you or you/Adrian
when the manuscript of that chapter is ready. I did my best to
approach the subject in ways to motivate the reader and not to pass on
the teachings or details which they are asked to read in your book;
but to offer them a strategic viewpoint for rethinking communications
and to see it as a way to actually grow themselves as better founders,
and better teams, as opposed to *using* communications such as to
polish things, like post-production, like the urgent world does it,
like what makes them lose opportunities in business and life and among
their colleagues.

If this idea sounds good, I can ship a printed copy to you when I
complete the "manuscript version". Or, I can send a PDF or I can share
an online document using Google Docs, or engage in other ways you may
suggest. Of course, if this is the case, you can engage in any way
that you feel to be appropriate: to just receive, to try to start
reading ig, to read the whole thing, to read and do nothing, or to
engage more. I say that because I understand that my presence in the
middle of great thoughts from great thinkers could well be a reason to
turn gold in garbage.

Abraços,
Cheers,
Marcio

Opa André, tudo bem?

Lembrei de você por interações onde você me ajudou e até trocas de ideias naquele assunto de metas, especificamente OKR e alinhamento e preocupação com educação e aspectos que ajudam empreendedores, além de seriedade com o assunto geral de empreendedorismo e gestão. 

Eu estou escrevendo um livro voltado para empreendedores, intitulado "Slow Down to Start Up", coisa que começou em 2016 de fato, porém não sabia já que tudo começava lento - não poderia 100% ligar os pontos. Com isso dito, para muitos tenha ficado claro o nascimento de um material de gestão. Enfim, este livro  traz reflexões para que empreendedores para que possam "rodar" de forma mais consciente no mundo cada vez mais acelerado, no meio de tantas narrativas, tantos conselhos, movimentos, sistemas, frameworks; que acabam também consumindo o dia a dia dos empreendedores, criando até confusões, desgastes, frustrações, perda da energia criativa, you name it. 

O livro tem vários temas, capítulos, onde um deles é sobre foco, intitulado "Not so radical focus", e intencionado a caminhar com o leitor-empreendedor em um processo mais reflexivo sobre o problema da
gestão com metas. De fato este capítulo promove OKR porém minha estratégia foi em "chamar" OKR para a conversa, fazer uma consulta tipo "o que OKR tem a nos dizer sobre esse problema X?"

Enfim tendo feito essa introdução e lhe comunicando sobre sobre o livro e o capítulo, primeiro gostaria de lhe agradecer - porque você esteve presente no meio de tantas conversas que fiz, com profissionais
envolvidos, e com isso logicamente agradeço porque eles me levaram a trabalhar neste livro de forma direta ou indireta.

Com isso dito, eu gostaria de lhe convidar, caso tenha interesse no tema do capítulo, em dar uma olhada no capítulo lembrando que está na versão rascunho-manuscrito é caracterizado como "cheio de palavras"
até em excesso. Eu entendo que muito do conteúdo pode ser reduzido, no processo de edição profissional adiante, mas que, neste momento, penso que é melhor estar cheio do que vazio e assim ambíguo. Do jeito que está revela as minhas fontes e intenções.

Caso a ideia for boa, a forma que eu proponho dessa interação segue, como sugestão: Eu estaria feliz em enviar o material para você, seja digital por meio de uma cópia no Google Docs ou - o que acho mais
legal - como um bloco de páginas impressas em papel A4 e com nível de zoom em 80% de tal forma que você teria uma margem ao lado direito e abaixo que dá para anotar ou mesmo marcar com cores. O kit acompanha 3 canetas: amarela, verde e esferográfica. Depois posso elaborar mais sobre a sugestão mas a ideia é algo mais leve onde o leitor-crítico pode usar os marcadores de proseado - verde para proseado legal e amarelo para proseado ambíguo sem se preocupar com o proseado ruim (vermelho) porque o processo naturalmente cuida do que não funciona. Assim, a caneta esferográfica fica para qualquer comentário relevante técnico.

A princípio a ideia espera uma interação leve, para o profissional convidado, mas que com isso trarão uma contribuição valiosa para o autor e para a audiência. Em outras palavras, essa interação se baseia na relação do interesse do convidado pela causa onde o mínimo esperado é um agradecimento formal, salvo qualquer ajuda que eu possa fazer em outras circunstâncias ou exceção onde o profissional convidado se pronunciar como interessado em qualquer processo como consultor ou editor em outras fases do livro.

Atenciosamente,

Opa Edilson tudo bem?

Lembrei de você pela questão de OKR, nossas conversas e até um alinhamento com ideias e também, logicamente ter notado sua dedicação a seriedade ao assunto geral de empreendedorismo e gestão, OKR também.

Eu estou escrevendo um livro voltado para empreendedores, intitulado "Slow Down to Start Up" , coisa que começou em 2016 de fato porém não sabia já que tudo começava bem lento. Mas que depois te tanto trabalho

```
My name is Marcio Galli, I am now living in Brazil - as an entrepreneur and writer - but in the past had a relative involvement with some iconic Silicon Valley companies like Netscape, Yahoo! and Mozilla. Before I inform you about the contribution that I am giving to entrepreneurs - and one specific about OKR - the following opening should inform you of this book that I have started in 2016 in slow pace after watching the Blitzscaling lectures and it is by now quite active after I have passed the mark of 128 days of work since April of 2023.

This book is entitled "Slow Down to Start Up," and it is intended to help entrepreneurs with a reflective approach as the abundance of data/models/frameworks/systems/platforms can be confusing to them. The motivation came from my struggles and then the observation that the people behind Blitzscaling (professors or the people interviewed) seemed to be good in terms of psychological characteristics like integrity, character, calmness, reflective thinkers, and the like. Therefore, I wanted to help others to engage in ideas like "Wait, hold on, before moving too fast with any frameworks or even advices," also because the startup hypermarket has now too many aisles and too many offerings. 

With this context, and being specific to OKR, I have a chapter entitled "Not so radical focus," which aside from any poor development from my side, as a conductor-writer, it exists because of my honest intention to serve as a reflective opportunity before anyone jumps too fast into OKR; where a possible engagement like an urgent move could set them to be frustrated with OKR, or confused, and worse to give up not only OKR but the concerns and learning about management based on goals. Therefore, the chapter - by the viewpoint of the book - invites the reader-entrepreneur to engage in the subject while OKR is not pushed, or introduced, as a playbook or anything like that since we know that we have a lot of that which is well done as you know, but it is brought alongside the theme as if I am "asking the OKR view about certain challenges." 

With this note I wanted to first let you know of this work but also to invite you to look at the draft-manuscript of this chapter. Or, if you look at it you may also pick or follow up by asking anyone that you know to get involved, if you feel that my work can be helpful to the world of founders. 

Sincerely, 

Marcio S Galli

## Letter - To MD in the McCallum article - On January 28th 2024 

* https://medium.com/@mcgd/thank-you-daniel-mccallum-133d27e98468

```
Inspired now and likely with some confusion but anyway ... When Reid Hoffman asked Michael if the approach of McCallum seemed to be micromanagement (this is inside Blitzscaling Lecture 03) which may be interpreted as such, I have remembered of the Mozilla team's invention known as Bugzilla which was BTW one of the most impactful product around that no one knew (why bother to tell others you are using a key open source component to get your things done) but anyways my point is:
That management grows in maturity by establishing micro management systems so that management surrenders from the micromanagement towards accessing values of another order. The creation of bugzilla was the natural automation of what would be a saturated condition of management - unacceptable inside Netscape and Mozilla - but acceptable through a system where people would do by what can be considered even volunteering work or protactive work. The non-interference of management into that matter is the realization that the matter becomes business as usual.
Now from that creation of the management, stepping away, they either accelerate the team into a whole failure or accelerate the tem into the opportunity; assuming that the new medium of interaction - where micro management is not anymore witnessed which was the case of Bugzilla - becomes a source for a friendly and heated activity where creation in the sense of a marketplace happens with no fights; and furthermore in ways that generates value to the major goal of the team.
It may be so that the management situation deals with unbundling a bundled condition - such as how we know to get things done - by bundling a marketplace in it that elevates the growth and value generation.

When I search inside myself - often there is nothing much I really do there - but it seems that the figure of Jim Barksdale appears again and again and I have to put upfront that I am not mistic as far as I know except if there are outside things I don't know of governing my intentions. Anyways if Jim appears more it may be - as far as I know - due to some iconic aspect of him and from the days of Netscape. While I didn't read much of what he were writing - and I may get into that I hope - I seemed to respect his figure that kept me able to learn about the browser and later to get a job at Netscape although sadly I did'tn meet him.

Today I have found - https://www.msreads.org/about-the-institute/the-barksdales/ which refers to Barksdale Management Corporation which when I queried on Linkedin I have found https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-b-cannada-47b27a12/ Don to be the CEO but Donna his wife runs the Barksdale reading institute  https://www.msreads.org/contact/  I am hereby pleased and interested in sending them a copy of the manuscript not only due to showing them a connection but also in alignment with the life of a non-reader and non-writer that had to become a writer and better reader.

## Letter - Asking Michael to get involved [feat. Michael Dearing]

Hi Michael,

I hope that you are well. I continue to move on in a quite consistent
way (episode 124 since April of last year) in a book for entrepreneurs
- and people that care about them and the future generations. Your
name appears on it but more than that it appears as a force that has
given me the means to believe.

I am attaching a draft of the Introduction to one of the chapters, Not
so Radical Focus, where you had contributed indirectly such as through
the footnotes linked.

With this note, my goal is to give you a heads up and material example
of what I am doing, first. In addition, it is an invitation for you to
get involved in any way you can. In other words, if you find it
interesting I would love to send the manuscript when ready for your
appreciation.

Of course, I understand that receiving it is one thing, looking at it
another, and so on. My point is that I am okay with any kind of
feedback and also happy anyway. In other words, I am thankful to you
for the many thoughts that you have given to us entrepreneurs via your
online materials.

There are at least two other chapters where you are present. One of
them is "Making peace with communications" which is an introduction to
SCqA and Executive Communications which focuses on the strategic
perspective of that kind of involvement with communications that can
go along with the growth of the entrepreneur, more than a
communication as a tool that is used when one wants to polish things,
after the fact.

Sincerely,

Marcio

## Letter - Asking for reference confirmation - [feat. Michael Dearing @ Harrison Metal]

* status - not sent 

```
Subject - Marcio's book - Slow Down to Start Up -  Referencing that 250-survey that confirms that successful entrepreneurs love clear communication about objectives

Hi Michael or team,

I wanted to reference a note from Michael from GM2 [1] course about a survey. I think part of the good data, Michael notes, is in the video but also there seems to be part available as a PDF [2]. I wonder if I could link to the PDF or if you have more on that survey. The context of my intention to link/refer to is the following:

I have a paragraph, in a material that I am working on [3], which basically is an easy to understand phrase that says that people of success will love to know clearly what they are doing and how they are progressing. In order to add a supporting point to that, I would love to link to Michael's discovery from the GM2 course - a note about the survey with 250 workers.

Would you think is fine if I make a footnote, referencing the GM2 course but moreover I wonder if could link to the PDF [2] too or even better if you have any specific public writing  on that survey.

## Revisinting a letter to Michael Dearing 

* Marcio wrote the following in March 15, 2021, to Michael Dearing. Michael replied and pointed that Schumpeter would consider some of that to be like "creative destruction at the level of the individual rather than the economy."

```
The founder-entrepreneur spirit, their way of living, is probably related to one being a bit frustrated with the world as it is. But not in the sense of not being grateful. 

Consider respect for others. They are mad about where we are. But if you try to tell them that the world is the same or worse than before, they will certainly be mad at you. What they see — different from many — is the founder-function within. They see what freedom fighters did, they feel empathy for the fight. Perhaps this thinking explains the founder-within function that makes a professor-investor-mentor look at stories such as of Harriet — the lady that optimized and scaled an iterative system and method for freeing slaves. 

But to exercise the founder-within, the founder needs to embrace their new person / new manager, necessarily. They can't face breaking the world, unfolding what's next, unbundling then bundling; without accepting their evolution, their change. It's impossible. 

Such founder spirit acts at the intersection between management for the known things and management for what is next. And this is exactly the stage, the context, and struggle, where they try to bring order from chaos. This aligns with how they consistently bring the word art on top of science. 

When Michael showed to Reid the case of Daniel McAllum, Reid wondered if McCallum was doing micromanagement. But at that moment micro-management didn't exist. McCallum's creation was *actually in fact* in the field of trying to propose methods for self-management for what was never done before, for what could not be done with the world and things as they knew it. One could even consider that he was trying to create a culture. 

One practical visualization of this is Bugzilla  — the issue-tracking and management system that was invented at Netscape in order to help with the development of the Mozilla Browser railroad, back in the days. Netscape Client Product division, building 21, was doing something new in terms of management. Eventually, Bugzilla was deployed in full-blown style at the whole building. Everyone was using Bugzilla to create issues, to ask for help, to add comments, to triage problems of all sorts. It was one of the most successful products of management. It was a system and method and the whole building was using it. They were micro-reporting things not usually done that way. And, by the way, that didn't grant the browser to survive at that point in time, necessarily. 

Yet and sticking to that Netscape story, here is another great note that depicts the inflection point when Netscape released Mozilla source to the open. From the words of Jim Barksdale, we can see proof that management was exercising new management — 

"Well, it's certainly my hope that the enormous amount of new people that no one could afford to have working on any product, now contributing to the Netscape Navigator Communicator, will make a significant difference in the improvement of the product. How that works against any competitor; remains to be seen. " Barksdale, Jim, 2013, 29min56sec. https://youtu.be/4Q7FTjhvZ7Y?t=1796 

It goes on and on and on. For now, I can't ask anything specific for new founders. One thing perhaps is applicable. Time. We need to watch out for how we run our actions in time. It is about time to allow time for the self.

## Letter to Jordan Peterson - Thank you for the writing process 

* https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/QgrcJHsBpWMxPGPCSWFDjHLfgbcGpDGlKJb

```
Hi Jordan,

I have seen a lot of interesting short videos from you and had an idea
that you had substance under these messages - by the very fact that
the messages seemed quite clear. But that was that. Then, one day, I
gave your book as a gift to my sister in law. And that was that. But
then, I had stumbled at your notes regarding writing and quite at the
very surface of your thoughts on that, I felt it was a moment to say
hello and thanks.

Therefore, thank you, for spreading the word about writing and to
bring up the interesting aspects of a process that, as you know, many
of us simply don't get it right. In the book that I am working - and
which is part of my self discovery process as writer or as a thinker
or as a person - which I started about 6 years ago, I may have finally
entered into the beginnings of a promising path now. Which likely took
me to visit the basics of your thoughts on writing.

One part in particular, the idea of throwing 80%, came at the right
time and right before I started to mess up with the material. My
situation is this, in short: I happened to have started the book work
around 6 years ago, not exactly sure where it would go. Then big
pauses. But then, this year, I felt good to go and it went through
well - also with support from Julia Cameron's The Right to Write. With
that, I am now at 100 episodes of work almost every day, the material
went from 250 pages - unstructured - to 500-600 pages with a
relatively better structure, for me, due to the "right to write" by
lowering the critic and some other helpful methods or models.That
brought me to be fascinated with some ideas I had arrived at, likely
related to achieving clarity through the process.

But then a complication came; related to the notion that I had to
control not to grow in pages, as if I had to deal with reducing. But
the real complication which is now clear due to your ideas, seems to
be the conflict of interests - like the author of the first draft with
the editor which pulls the self critic. Some good ideas seemed to be
in the air, as in "should I just let it grow?" or "Should I cut
later?" But these were not strong enough.

This is where your ideas helped. The thoughts such as the image that I
could cut 80% of it later. But a lot of what I saw in a video that
someone had edited from you, related to writing, seems o be quite
clear and strong.

Therefore, I had downloaded your essay on writing to study it too.

Thanks,

Marcio

Hey Eric, 

How things. I am working in a book entitled Slow Down Startup which I believe it may support entrepreneurs with more conscious entrepreneurship in the face of the too many options, too many of-the-shelf solutions for advancing.

It's sort of a book for even before starting. 

Your name has appeared across over a few areas because of the concerns and consciousness viewpoint that you provided such as when you are concerned with the entrepreneurs, or teams, their behaviors that prevent them to access purpose accross their siloed focus. 

I wonder, if I can first send you a PDF that has an overview of the structure of the book, as a way so that you can know of my in progress work which is BTW about 6 years although I started slow and not so clear. In the past 6 months I am writing almost every day though, so I believe the process looks now closer to real writers. 

Sincerely, 

Marcio

Hi Adrian, 
Thanks again for that day to be in the session. I am sending this draft of the overview of my book, which is so far entitled Slow Down Startup and meant to help founders and supporters of entrepreneurship in a world where everything seems to be too fast. 
If you can please take a look, I would appreciate. And apologies for the draft condition. In addition, I wanted to let you know that I am consistently writing - and for the actual core writing process not using ChatGPT. By now, after 90 episodes of work done consistently since I had returned to work in this book earlier this year, I know that it was the best thing to do - Barbara's note to me helped. 

It could be that I have started to grasp what it means to be a writer, of course, by the practice, the doing, in the everyday. Yes, some ChatGPT usage happens, like drafting the APA citations, and some footnotes too, but not to a point to mess up with my brain and to prevent style, flow, and other benefits from happening. 

Another point and reason of my contact, besides to let you know all this, is to wonder if you happen to be working in a way or another with writing, or anything related to the world of entrepreneurs; and if so or if you happen to see a reason to engage, even if it is to take a look, I would love to send you the manuscript when ready. 

Cheers, 

Marcio

## Letter to David Smooke of Hackernoon, On November 30th, 2023

* Ref 42849289-42984982-92484928-20849284, conversation followup on Linkedin. 

```
(If you want I can e-mail this if you give me your e-mail) 

Hi David, 

What I am about to inform you might be a result of one amateur writer, amateur entrepreneur, wantrepreneur, wannabe writer - you name it - that had received help to become a writer from the perspective that a writer starts with the act of writing.

In this context, Hackernoon, of course, had offered help, a space, an opportunity. In addition, of course, many others like Julia Cameron to name a special name. 

So I am writing a book. Part one of this note. One which I didn't know when navigating the origins of it, by 2017, by that timeframe which BTW I had become an Uber driver for 1000 trips (on Fridays) and somehow the driving took me into writing, which produced the following articles, the first of them on The Ascent, and the other I think youself had approved it when Hackernoon was on Medium - this is when our story begins. 

[Why that first Uber (driver) trip never happened | by Marcio S Galli | Ascent Publication | Medium](https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc)

[Never Send a Business Model Canvas to Your Investors | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/never-send-a-business-model-canvas-to-your-investors-f832fd854518)

To add more to this first point, the book, so far entitled Slow Down Startup, shows a great deal of connection with a point of view - which I can't say yet that it is style - that had in that article about canvas, which has to do with a calmer mind which is necessary for entrepreneurship, especially in the days when all seems to hyperconnected. The draft has about 480 pages I am trying to keep under 500 with the goal of arriving at 250-300 - as if the number of pages were a topic to talk about. 

Now the other point is that I do have, in one of the chapters, a section where I talk about Lean, and Canvas, and somehow I caught myself remembering the reply that you said when I wrote that article ( "Never Send the Business Model Canvas to Your Investor" ) when you published it, as you wrote something like "Oops I just did". 

At this stage, I added added a bit of color, and thoughts, and made a reference to the situation. I had indicated that CEO of a publication when had replied "Oops, I just did" doesn't tell if he were using Canvas wrong or right. But what is more important is that it happens to mean more, that the matter of being aware about the responsible use of lean tools, such as business model canvas, are good themes to be concerned with. In other words, that CEO wanted to remind himself of being aware. 

Now, I would or could perhaps keep that story as that, or also to add a reference in the footnote about Hackernoon and/or your name; so I am asking your permission or it case it is not nice just wonder if I can keep the story without mentioning names or the publication. 

Beyond that, I would very much like to say thanks to you and Hackernoon from a general point of view of having supported my life as a writer. Or perhaps the beginning of it. 

Sincerely, 

Marcio

```
Hey Chris,

So I may have touched the subject - of a book - perhaps a few times. I
had started a material - based on studies of the Blitzscaling lectures
around 2017. Not consistently, mostly slides or drafts and articles
came along in an online publication which helped me to advance with an
initial belief of being a writer. But this year, around 6 months ago,
I went back to it and had engaged in a consistent writing path - as in
writing almost every day except time off - 80+ episodes of writing by
now.

The book is for entrepreneurs trying to make startups in the
accelerated and networked world. And may also matter for parents and
anyone like investors, coaches, supporters, as they care about
founders and their future companies.

For now I am attaching a PDF which has the audience, theme, structure
and a personal note about the origins of the book. In case the
material rings any bells, or if you know of a special person that
could be interested too, please let me know and I will be happy to
send the manuscript as any special person and perspectives are always
welcome.

Draft has by now about 500 pages but I will try to get it to become
250-300 if I can and if it does not hurt the value.

Hey Brendan,

I am sure you have entered a path of being busy - focusing on Brave -
but if somehow the theme interests you I would be happy to send the
draft manuscript when ready. Even if it is to take a look to see if it
rings any bells.

The subject of the book deals with the urgency and pressures of the
world, however in the domain of founders (and anyone interested in
helping them like parents or investors) that are motivated to do
startups as in startups to grow.

I started this material around 2017 when I was studying the
Blitzscaling lectures [1] the very course that gave me awareness of a
readiness level - of human beings - that seemed to be important to
make great lasting companies. And I had written drafts, bits and
pieces, then somehow in the last 6 months I had entered a consistent
writing path, one which I never did in my life, as in now writing for
80+ consecutive days aside from pauses like time off and vacation.

The general overview is attached, so that you can appreciate the
theme, audience, structure, and more on origins of the material. In
case it does not ring any bell but you know people that may be
interested in reading the draft manuscript (when ready) I will be glad
to connect.

## Letter to Jason of It Does not Have to be Crazy at Work, November 21th 2023 

* Via linkedin connection,

Hi Jason,

Thanks for connecting. I am Marcio Galli, now living in Brazil, I lived in the Bay Area from 2000-2005 (Netscape, Yahoo! Mozilla). 

Since the days when I started to watch the Blitzscaling course and interviews [1] I started to get a sense of a disconnect between the model/approach of many founders when doing their startups (such as their too fast interaction with lean tools) with what seemed to be a conscious character of some of the folks interviewed.  

In other words, I started to sense  that what it takes to be a great founder was a readiness level, as in, to be short, of a calmer person. I had then found relative awareness that many of the lean tools or methods do provide words of caution although how founders perceive these tools and methods seemed to take them to not read the small letters. 

Then I kept working in drafts but in the past 4-6 months I caught myself writing consistently and it seems to be moving in the direction of a book manuscript - so far entitled Slow Down Startup. 

During this phase I also received a recommendation from a friend to read your book, which I loved and even supported with a sense of - this is right. 

With this openning, I am leaving an introduction presentation in attachment, as PDF, of the work, which attempts to explain the audience, theme, reason/goal and structure. I appreciate if you could take a look. 

With that, and from there, and in case the topic matters or rings any bell, I wonder if you allow me to send the manuscript, aside from any possibility of interaction. 

Thank you for reading my note, 

Thank you for your work.

Hey Michael, 

Hope you are doing good. I am working in a book, I figured, after the many years since I came across the Blitzscaling talks. And yours, number 3, was the talk that asked me to stop and learn. 

Taming the critic was critical, as you may sense. The materials I came upon, the insights, are at the same time too basic or too deep. It is likely the best thing I ever came up with. At the same time, I know, it might be wrong, it might be poor, it may be just a baby step in trying to understand the human operating system for when people get into a boat, the boat of entrepreneurs. 

In attachment I have included an intro, like a presentation of the book for an investor role, or a stakeholder, partner, you name it. I am sending this to you, to Chris Yeh, John Lilly.

* "I know that in moving towards this manuscript I have to sort of be confined a little bit, to hold my emotions or my need to write to some people. But I can't resist this inner drive that made me access a whole new level of passion about entrepreneurship. As I move closer to the manuscript - a guess a milestone - I touched again the Blitzscaling talks, and especially the recap one, which is one you spoke significantly. And I was able to see, in your eyes and your spirit (call it whatever you want I am not religious) how much you really care(d) about the students in that room and the general audience that they represented. Then I felt how humble you were, there, you and the Blitzscaling crew; humble and thankful for having the attention of those students of 183C. "

## Paul Graham 

Hi Paul,

Hope that you are doing well. 

Thanks for your writing about writing. I have been going through such discoveries related to writing in the past two years more intensively. And also quite interested and reflecting on the role of writing in developing a start-up.

When I was reading your note [1], I recalled moments of the lectures on writing [2] by Ayn Rand. Likewise to the situation when reading your essay, the reading of her notes also brought me closer to understanding more about the struggles of writing non-fiction connected with the process of writing.

I'm not sure if you have had a chance to read it, but I feel that you will enjoy it. The following are some parts that align with your essay:

* Writing x Unconsciousness - she expressed a lot about the unconscious aspects of writing. She illustrates situations such as a) the importance of writing a draft without engaging in editing vs. other modes of writing such as editing (conscious mode), b) writing a draft without asking for advice (to avoid conflicting conscious with the unconscious). // Ref PG's note is: "In both cases, there were things I didn't consciously realize till I had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous. A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners." [1]

* The idea of the people that write "perfect" at once - She speaks of these people comparing them with somnambulant. In her view, if you wake them up, they can't continue to write. // Ref to PG's note is: "But I've never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than their ability." [1]

She clearly shows herself as the one who had to go from zero to one (10+ years to write a book, etc.) and illustrates many conditions that a writer feels as they move.

Book Slow Down to Win (temporary name)

Marcio Galli <taboca@gmail.com>

Hi Paul,

I hope you are well. I am back, hopefully on a better track, working
on a book that helps founders to walk their way with a more conscious
approach. As in to know how to tame the situation you might have
touched when you said "following their instincts" [1].

I would like to invite you to help me with an interview - or
conversation - to get more of your wisdom regarding if you think that
there is a better state of well being that can support
entrepreneurship, if that is a requirement or not, and how to nurture
it.

The Situation-Complication is when a founder (say a beginner-founder)
just tries to grasp what is going on and falls into the possibility of
getting everything wrong, such as to use all the lean ways in wrong
ways. To put an example, of something that you pointed out - that YC
has something for them if they listen - an entrepreneur could well use
that line although enter a poorer acceleration program and end up
listening; which could well push them to say "I wish we didn't listen"
(in the context of a poor accelerator) as opposed to the "I wish we'd
listened" (which works for YC).

This might contextualize the book in a way. So I am using those eyes.
I would say the book could be a response to all the possible "entry
points for entrepreneurship" but using a "hold on there" point of
view. It seems to touch on the psychology of human beings x
entrepreneurship.

Although I did say the interview, I don't have a specific set of
questions for you, PG. But I can work them out. Or, I can join you in
call to have a more open conversation with you about speed, urgency,
slowing down, and the state of being that could better save them from
being "accelerated" into the wrong ways.

In case this topic is interesting, I would love to have the
opportunity to listen to you, and to get your point of view about this
theme.

Sincerely,

Marcio

[1] "The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that
startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a
lot of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them. When I was running Y Combinator I used to
joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore.
It's really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders
about mistakes they're about to make, and the founders ignore them,
and then come back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened." -
