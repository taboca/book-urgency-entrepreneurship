Hi Adrian, 
Thanks again for that day to be in the session. I am sending this draft of the overview of my book, which is so far entitled Slow Down Startup and meant to help founders and supporters of entrepreneurship in a world where everything seems to be too fast. 
If you can please take a look, I would appreciate. And apologies for the draft condition. In addition, I wanted to let you know that I am consistently writing - and for the actual core writing process not using ChatGPT. By now, after 90 episodes of work done consistently since I had returned to work in this book earlier this year, I know that it was the best thing to do - Barbara's note to me helped. 

It could be that I have started to grasp what it means to be a writer, of course, by the practice, the doing, in the everyday. Yes, some ChatGPT usage happens, like drafting the APA citations, and some footnotes too, but not to a point to mess up with my brain and to prevent style, flow, and other benefits from happening. 

Another point and reason of my contact, besides to let you know all this, is to wonder if you happen to be working in a way or another with writing, or anything related to the world of entrepreneurs; and if so or if you happen to see a reason to engage, even if it is to take a look, I would love to send you the manuscript when ready. 

Cheers, 

Marcio

## Letter to David Smooke of Hackernoon, On November 30th, 2023

* Ref 42849289-42984982-92484928-20849284, conversation followup on Linkedin.

(If you want I can e-mail this if you give me your e-mail) 

Hi David, 

What I am about to inform you might be a result of one amateur writer, amateur entrepreneur, wantrepreneur, wannabe writer - you name it - that had received help to become a writer from the perspective that a writer starts with the act of writing.

In this context, Hackernoon, of course, had offered help, a space, an opportunity. In addition, of course, many others like Julia Cameron to name a special name. 

So I am writing a book. Part one of this note. One which I didn't know when navigating the origins of it, by 2017, by that timeframe which BTW I had become an Uber driver for 1000 trips (on Fridays) and somehow the driving took me into writing, which produced the following articles, the first of them on The Ascent, and the other I think youself had approved it when Hackernoon was on Medium - this is when our story begins. 

[Why that first Uber (driver) trip never happened | by Marcio S Galli | Ascent Publication | Medium](https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc)

[Never Send a Business Model Canvas to Your Investors | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/never-send-a-business-model-canvas-to-your-investors-f832fd854518)

To add more to this first point, the book, so far entitled Slow Down Startup, shows a great deal of connection with a point of view - which I can't say yet that it is style - that had in that article about canvas, which has to do with a calmer mind which is necessary for entrepreneurship, especially in the days when all seems to hyperconnected. The draft has about 480 pages I am trying to keep under 500 with the goal of arriving at 250-300 - as if the number of pages were a topic to talk about. 

Now the other point is that I do have, in one of the chapters, a section where I talk about Lean, and Canvas, and somehow I caught myself remembering the reply that you said when I wrote that article ( "Never Send the Business Model Canvas to Your Investor" ) when you published it, as you wrote something like "Oops I just did". 

At this stage, I added added a bit of color, and thoughts, and made a reference to the situation. I had indicated that CEO of a publication when had replied "Oops, I just did" doesn't tell if he were using Canvas wrong or right. But what is more important is that it happens to mean more, that the matter of being aware about the responsible use of lean tools, such as business model canvas, are good themes to be concerned with. In other words, that CEO wanted to remind himself of being aware. 

Now, I would or could perhaps keep that story as that, or also to add a reference in the footnote about Hackernoon and/or your name; so I am asking your permission or it case it is not nice just wonder if I can keep the story without mentioning names or the publication. 

Beyond that, I would very much like to say thanks to you and Hackernoon from a general point of view of having supported my life as a writer. Or perhaps the beginning of it. 

Sincerely, 

Marcio

Hi Ted,

The attachment is to let you know of this project which now has
reached a state of continuous writing based on the past 80 episodes of
work (except time off) while the origins were slow from 2017 when I
started to study the Blitzscaling lectures while as usual trying to
make a company.

In case you happen to want to take a look when the manuscript is
ready, in case the topic interests you in any way, please let me know.

Hey Chris,

So I may have touched the subject - of a book - perhaps a few times. I
had started a material - based on studies of the Blitzscaling lectures
around 2017. Not consistently, mostly slides or drafts and articles
came along in an online publication which helped me to advance with an
initial belief of being a writer. But this year, around 6 months ago,
I went back to it and had engaged in a consistent writing path - as in
writing almost every day except time off - 80+ episodes of writing by
now.

The book is for entrepreneurs trying to make startups in the
accelerated and networked world. And may also matter for parents and
anyone like investors, coaches, supporters, as they care about
founders and their future companies.

For now I am attaching a PDF which has the audience, theme, structure
and a personal note about the origins of the book. In case the
material rings any bells, or if you know of a special person that
could be interested too, please let me know and I will be happy to
send the manuscript as any special person and perspectives are always
welcome.

Draft has by now about 500 pages but I will try to get it to become
250-300 if I can and if it does not hurt the value.

MG

## Letter to Brendan Eich on November 29th 2023

Hey Brendan,

I am sure you have entered a path of being busy - focusing on Brave -
but if somehow the theme interests you I would be happy to send the
draft manuscript when ready. Even if it is to take a look to see if it
rings any bells.

The subject of the book deals with the urgency and pressures of the
world, however in the domain of founders (and anyone interested in
helping them like parents or investors) that are motivated to do
startups as in startups to grow.

I started this material around 2017 when I was studying the
Blitzscaling lectures [1] the very course that gave me awareness of a
readiness level - of human beings - that seemed to be important to
make great lasting companies. And I had written drafts, bits and
pieces, then somehow in the last 6 months I had entered a consistent
writing path, one which I never did in my life, as in now writing for
80+ consecutive days aside from pauses like time off and vacation.

The general overview is attached, so that you can appreciate the
theme, audience, structure, and more on origins of the material. In
case it does not ring any bell but you know people that may be
interested in reading the draft manuscript (when ready) I will be glad
to connect.

Sincerely,

Marcio Galli

## Letter to Jason of It Does not Have to be Crazy at Work, November 21th 2023 

* Via linkedin connection,

Hi Jason,

Thanks for connecting. I am Marcio Galli, now living in Brazil, I lived in the Bay Area from 2000-2005 (Netscape, Yahoo! Mozilla). 

Since the days when I started to watch the Blitzscaling course and interviews [1] I started to get a sense of a disconnect between the model/approach of many founders when doing their startups (such as their too fast interaction with lean tools) with what seemed to be a conscious character of some of the folks interviewed.  

In other words, I started to sense  that what it takes to be a great founder was a readiness level, as in, to be short, of a calmer person. I had then found relative awareness that many of the lean tools or methods do provide words of caution although how founders perceive these tools and methods seemed to take them to not read the small letters. 

Then I kept working in drafts but in the past 4-6 months I caught myself writing consistently and it seems to be moving in the direction of a book manuscript - so far entitled Slow Down Startup. 

During this phase I also received a recommendation from a friend to read your book, which I loved and even supported with a sense of - this is right. 

With this openning, I am leaving an introduction presentation in attachment, as PDF, of the work, which attempts to explain the audience, theme, reason/goal and structure. I appreciate if you could take a look. 

With that, and from there, and in case the topic matters or rings any bell, I wonder if you allow me to send the manuscript, aside from any possibility of interaction. 

Thank you for reading my note, 

Thank you for your work.

Hi Jason, thx for the IdHtbCaW book. 

I caught myself in a learning which led me to actively write a book for founders - Slow Down Startup. 

I would love to send to you a short PDF which has purpose, audience, structure, for your appreciation first; so in case you happen to like and have time [+]

```
Hey Michael, 

Hope you are doing good. I am working in a book, I figured, after the many years since I came across the Blitzscaling talks. And yours, number 3, was the talk that asked me to stop and learn. 

Taming the critic was critical, as you may sense. The materials I came upon, the insights, are at the same time too basic or too deep. It is likely the best thing I ever came up with. At the same time, I know, it might be wrong, it might be poor, it may be just a baby step in trying to understand the human operating system for when people get into a boat, the boat of entrepreneurs. 

In attachment I have included an intro, like a presentation of the book for an investor role, or a stakeholder, partner, you name it. I am sending this to you, to Chris Yeh, John Lilly.

## Chris Yeh, not sent letter but written on 29/09/2023

* "I know that in moving towards this manuscript I have to sort of be confined a little bit, to hold my emotions or my need to write to some people. But I can't resist this inner drive that made me access a whole new level of passion about entrepreneurship. As I move closer to the manuscript - a guess a milestone - I touched again the Blitzscaling talks, and especially the recap one, which is one you spoke significantly. And I was able to see, in your eyes and your spirit (call it whatever you want I am not religious) how much you really care(d) about the students in that room and the general audience that they represented. Then I felt how humble you were, there, you and the Blitzscaling crew; humble and thankful for having the attention of those students of 183C. " 

## Thanks to Sune Lehmann and Johann Hari, due to resarch of Sune from Stolen Focus 

Thanks for your research. I am working, about 4 years, in a book entitled "Slow Down Start-up" especially for founders. And the research helped to add clarity about what I was referring as "urgent accelerated world. " 

## Paul Graham 

Hi Paul,

Hope that you are doing well. 

Thanks for your writing about writing. I have been going through such discoveries related to writing in the past two years more intensively. And also quite interested and reflecting on the role of writing in developing a start-up.

When I was reading your note [1], I recalled moments of the lectures on writing [2] by Ayn Rand. Likewise to the situation when reading your essay, the reading of her notes also brought me closer to understanding more about the struggles of writing non-fiction connected with the process of writing.

I'm not sure if you have had a chance to read it, but I feel that you will enjoy it. The following are some parts that align with your essay:

* Writing x Unconsciousness - she expressed a lot about the unconscious aspects of writing. She illustrates situations such as a) the importance of writing a draft without engaging in editing vs. other modes of writing such as editing (conscious mode), b) writing a draft without asking for advice (to avoid conflicting conscious with the unconscious). // Ref PG's note is: "In both cases, there were things I didn't consciously realize till I had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous. A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners." [1]

* The idea of the people that write "perfect" at once - She speaks of these people comparing them with somnambulant. In her view, if you wake them up, they can't continue to write. // Ref to PG's note is: "But I've never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than their ability." [1]

She clearly shows herself as the one who had to go from zero to one (10+ years to write a book, etc.) and illustrates many conditions that a writer feels as they move.

Book Slow Down to Win (temporary name)

Hi Paul,

I hope you are well. I am back, hopefully on a better track, working
on a book that helps founders to walk their way with a more conscious
approach. As in to know how to tame the situation you might have
touched when you said "following their instincts" [1].

I would like to invite you to help me with an interview - or
conversation - to get more of your wisdom regarding if you think that
there is a better state of well being that can support
entrepreneurship, if that is a requirement or not, and how to nurture
it.

The Situation-Complication is when a founder (say a beginner-founder)
just tries to grasp what is going on and falls into the possibility of
getting everything wrong, such as to use all the lean ways in wrong
ways. To put an example, of something that you pointed out - that YC
has something for them if they listen - an entrepreneur could well use
that line although enter a poorer acceleration program and end up
listening; which could well push them to say "I wish we didn't listen"
(in the context of a poor accelerator) as opposed to the "I wish we'd
listened" (which works for YC).

This might contextualize the book in a way. So I am using those eyes.
I would say the book could be a response to all the possible "entry
points for entrepreneurship" but using a "hold on there" point of
view. It seems to touch on the psychology of human beings x
entrepreneurship.

Although I did say the interview, I don't have a specific set of
questions for you, PG. But I can work them out. Or, I can join you in
call to have a more open conversation with you about speed, urgency,
slowing down, and the state of being that could better save them from
being "accelerated" into the wrong ways.

In case this topic is interesting, I would love to have the
opportunity to listen to you, and to get your point of view about this
theme.

Sincerely,

Marcio

[1] "The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that
startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a
lot of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them. When I was running Y Combinator I used to
joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore.
It's really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders
about mistakes they're about to make, and the founders ignore them,
and then come back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened." -
