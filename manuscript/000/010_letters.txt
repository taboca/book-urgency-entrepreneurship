## Letter to Brad Delong, of Berkeley, June 14th, 2024 #Curve #MichaelDearing #1millionBC #gdp

```
Hello Brad,

I am Marcio S Galli, writing a book [1] for entrepreneurs, essentially asking them to slow down and reflect before going too fast. I came across your nice curve because of the work of Michael Dearing, from Harrison Metal. From his talks he mentions your curve at the beginning:

* reference - Dearing, M. (2018, February 13). Michael Dearing at the 2018 NYC Product Leader Summit: "Two Blasts from the Past" [Video]. YouTube. Spero Ventures. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBOOcBgHxTU
* reference - Dearing, M. (2015, October 8). Blitzscaling 03: Michael Dearing on Capitalism, Creativity, and Creative Destruction [Video]. Greylock. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vCdfa_aeI8
* reference - Heavybit. (2019, July 30). Executive communication w/ Harrison Metal [Video]. Retrieved from https://www.heavybit.com/library/video/executive-communication

As part of an introduction to a section of a chapter, entitled Impact, I am excited to use an introduction that refers to how Michael loves your curve, his comments, and of course with that comes the question - What would be the ideal source to refer to that curve?

I had found this one: https://www.bradford-delong.com/2014/05/estimates-of-world-gdp-one-million-bc-present-1998-my-view-as-of-1998-the-honest-broker-for-the-week-of-may-24-2014.html although noted that the one referred from Michael's slides is not available anymore.

Thus, I wonder if you have a recommendation in terms of a source so I can add to the footnote and or link from the references. The context, how I refer to it, follows the thinking from Michael, making a point that a lot didn't happen before and that during the industrial revolution things changed. And then, as I move on with the chapter, I ask founders to not only follow the movement but to think through, to find purpose and carry on their values. The book has to do with the calmer conscious founder setting which may support their growth paths.

Now, I didn't have time to look at your other things since this was the first time I have visited your site. But it seems that you are too a very special person. A bit of that called my attention, so far, when I saw your interest in figuring out blogging. But that is another thing and I don't want, for now, to take the conversation to another direction.

Thank you so much Brad.

Sincerely,
 
+55 16 9 8123 3210

[1] The book I'm working on is, so far, entitled Slow Down to Start-Up. I am a first time writer. Of course, if in any event you want to read the section which I refer to Michael and your curve, and you, I will be happy to send the draft when I have it. It may be so too that you may have amazing thoughts associated with the graph. I wonder - maybe I should read too if you have done reflections for people or founders.

Hey my friend, 

So I hereby invite you to enter a reading experience, in case you have cycles and are really free. I am inclined to ship. And it can be 5 or 10 pages for example or if you are brave I can ship a whole chapter. 

A note about the sort of experience: I found that, especially at this stage, a reader may simply annotate, on the side of the paper, something about the image that was formed, or feelings. This helps us to understand if coherence is being built. 

A warning. The text is not far from the original innocent version, so it may smell, you may detect the vomit smell. But I rather go with this because if I give to you something after an editor it turns out that it may not smell but it may lack flavor too. As we know, in the urgent world, professional editors may just cut all the bad pieces. 

If you happen to have time and feel this idea is not bad, please send me your address. Nevertheless, I shall use this time to celebrate our friendship and interactions because I would get to this point without all the support and help from my good friends. 

Marcio

Hi Susie, 

I hereby and in-loco by the means of this digital letter come to invite you to a reading experience which might be challenging to a great extent exactly because it is not about the sort of reading that might be a pleasure after a professional editor engages and prepares a text for the delight of the reader. On the contrary, if you choose to accept this mission, this is likely a reading experience where the brave reader shall hold in her hands a text that is nor far from the original vomited text of an innocent writer. 

In case you feel that you have some cycles for that kind of experience, please let me know. But aside from that, I think that the interactions we had in life had already helped me so much to get to the point that I am, which also involved becoming a writer. 

In case you feel that you may be able to take a look, I wonder if you can send your address so I can ship a few pages. I have sections of 5 others of 10 and other aggregated forms, like chapters, which have around 40-60 pages. 

One approach, for the kind of feedback I am looking for, I am especially interested in the light and fast or the interesting feelings or images that comes to the mind of the reader when she reads, as she reads, as in when passing through a paragraph or a block of paragraphs. So you may, for example, mark the words and make a note on the side. Of course, if follows from that that the reader may make an annotation somewhere after a number of sections goes, as in to open herself about a whole image which perhaps were formed, something about structure or about the logic or about coherence. 

Again, this is not far from the first drafts, but it makes sense to be shared for this kind of experience because if I do it after a professional editor, as we know, a professional editor may cut value from it too fast. 

With all of this said, the main point of my message has to be celebrated. You already helped me to make this. By being a supportive person, by showing to me your passion for communication, by being a writer. And with all of that said, of course, you can jump to do whatever you want to do from the reading experience - totally ignoring my notes. 

Thank you, 

Marcio

Oi Jacque, 
Caso a sorte caia em seu caminho, no sentido que cada vez mais lhe traz um dia de relaxamento onde coisas, até as que parecem trabalho, não mais parecem como trabalho (o que é meu desejo para meus amigos), eu então lhe convido para um momento de leitura. Ainda, se você tiver tempo, para aceitar algo como 5 páginas, ou 10 páginas, por exemplo. Existem trechos de todos os tamanhos. 
Eu tentaria escolher um trecho qualquer que sinto que está pronto para ser lido. O ponto principal deste tipo de experiência/leitura seria voltado em tentar captar de você o que você sente ou imagina na medida que avança por parágrafos ou blocos de parágrafos. Como se você estivesse revelando o que imaginou. Lógico que decorre disso uma imagem sobre a estrutura do trecho, sobre possível coerência. 

Está longe ainda de ser uma leitura daquelas tipo "prova de leitura" que vem depois da edição. E isso faz sentido, acredito, porque se eu enviar depois do trabalho feito por um editor profissional eu corro o risco de um potencial valor ser perdido, dado que editores profissionais irão provavelmente correr e podem não sentir e podem cortar. 
Se sim eu posso imprimir e te entregar ou enviar por carta. A recomendação é 75% o tamanho, na impressão, assim deixando espaço do lado para notas. 

Marcio

Hi DB, 

I thought, in case you have cycles, as in horse-power cycles, if you are interested in reading a section of the book. This may be about 5-10 pages for example and the reading experience can be light in a way. 

Of course, it isn't, because the material can be considered as a manuscript and is quite tied with the original vomited version. The smell is in there and that should set the reader dizzy. However, and here is my hope, it may beso that a certain condition sets in, perhaps a sunny day, perhaps a moment that even a good pint of Guinness follows along.  

So if you think that life may bring possibility, then I shall be happy to send to you actual printed pages via mail with a 75% size so that you can make annotations on the side. As a suggestion, I wonder if it makes sense for a reading experience where you tell me about the images that formed into your mind as you are reading, and logically it follows from that that you will get a sense if coherence follows too. With that said, any other kind of feedback is well-appreciated. 

If so, send me your physical address. 

Marcio

Opa, tudo bem?

Você gostaria de ler uma seção arbitrária do livro [1] que estou
trabalhando? Tem várias seções que estão chegando em estágios que já
podem ser lidas, ou experienciadas. Não seria uma revisão tipo edição,
seria mais uma leitura mesmo, até sem muita regra. No seu caso eu não
pensei em passar um ou outro trecho, porque acho que o ponto principal
que considero neste momento não é se estou certo ou errado, mas se tem
clareza ou coerência. O que talvez faça mais sentido já que comunicar
bem é um tema que nos interessa #acredito.

Sobre o tipo de leitura/feedback que procuro, algumas notas: Pode ser
uma leitura leve. O Rodrigo, que trabalha na portaria do meu prédio,
engajou em uma sessão de leitura e me passou anotações no papel mesmo,
a lápis. É um estilo que faz algum sentido e só coloco aqui como
sugestão mesmo. Ele marcou o que sentiu, as imagens que se formaram no
momento da leitura de trechos, como parágrafos. Lógico que decorre
disso, que fica anotado um mapa sobre se o texto leva o leitor em um
caminho, se tem coerência.

Caso achar válido, eu posso a) escolher um trecho e b) imprimir e c)
enviar pelos Correios ou caso você passe em Ribeirão eu posso deixar
com você. Alternativamente, eu posso enviar o trecho em PDF e você
imprime e faz as anotações no papel e me entrega. Alternativamente,
pode mandar as notas via meios digitais.

Enfim, se quiser, pode fazer como quiser. Tudo ajuda.

Para: Christian Vidigal <vidigal@gmail.com>
Vedigas,

Caso queira ler um trecho, meio prolixo por carregar ainda
caracterizações da versão vomitada, eu tenho um deles em mãos.

A leitura pode ser meio arbitrária, leve, como a pessoa quiser. Porém,
um interesse possível, nesta fase, é entender quais imagens
interessantes são formadas quando a pessoa vai lendo, ou quais imagens
distraem elas. E se coerência é formada.

Caso tenha alguns ciclos, acho que poderia acontecer da pessoa usar de
30 minutos a 2-4 horas em alguns casos. Importante ela revelar o que
leu, tipo se ela só leu o primeiro parágrafo, indicar. Dá um toque,
caso tiver alguns ciclos cavalo-vapor, que eu imprimo as 10 páginas, e
levo em mãos ou via Uber.

Este trecho, "Full-blown procrastinator" está dentro do capítulo
Running, dentro da segunda parte do capítulo que fala de Medos.
Especificamente traz a situação do Andy / Intel onde a Intel passou
pelo Vale da Morte, forças 10x, e onde os líderes vão sentir sensações
do luto com negação escapismo barganha, aceitação etc.

Hey Ted,

Now an update for the general overview doc. It's 17 pages because I
had pasted the whole reference section. I hope to come up with the
manuscript by mid year. Sadly I think that this brief overview does
not capture the style, the language. But any of the chapters and even
the intro or foreword does.

Hi Chris,

I wanted to let you know of how this book work is going - the one I mentioned in August last year - the book so far entitled  Slow Down to Start-up.

In terms of activity, I wrote to you around episode 144 of work, as in consistent work. Now, I am around episode 219. Per day work Improved from 2-3h to 3-6h. It's active, not painful, although manuscript is yet baking. And more I advance more I would appreciate your support in any way, although most of your help was clearly done by the Blitzscaling lectures. 

Today, I have updated a draft for the overview. The PDF has 17 pages but only so because it includes a copy and paste of the reference section; which also gives an interesting x-ray view from above. 

I wonder if I can send that to you, as a step towards sending the manuscript. If so, via here? Or perhaps this could be an opportunity for us to exchange e-mails so I can send from there. 

Anyway, I appreciate your attention. 

Thank you and sincerely, 

Marcio

Hi Doug,

In a prior message, I wrote to let you know of a draft for a section
of a book which I am working on - specifically a section where I
discuss fears. A section that I had quoted you.

Now, I am attaching an actual overview of the book. The PDF is 17
pages because I have included the references.

I hope that this note finds you in a good moment, and, in case the
theme interests you, I am inviting you to read the manuscript for one
or more chapters. If so, I can send an index of the chapters and
summaries of each, by the time that the manuscript is ready.

Hi Chris,

I had updated today the v2.8 of the intro to the book, attached, after
doing other cycles of writing/editing in the whole material, not
exactly this one. The total sum of days are not around 200 days
writing.Today, I did a pass in this one, although not with careful
editing as needed.

Anyway, in terms of the updates, I kept that "Introduction", yet using
SCqA, as a part or a placeholder to explain the structure of the book,
and why. This is for the case that the
reader-investor-partner-supporter wants to know the logical structure
of the book. In theory, the very first paragraph wants to be a
placeholder for a short introduction. The other sections are in a way
supporting points as in "more info". I had removed some parts at the
bottom and dumped a set of references I have used which I learned that
it tells a lot to the kind of audience of supporters at this stage.
Notice that among the audience of supporters we have people like Chris
Yeh (coauthor of Reid Hoffman), Steve Blank (Lean Startup Movement).

I am approaching a phase where I am fine with what I wrote for about
10 chapters.Not meaning that they are good but to some extent that
they are enough in the sense of what an author wanted to put it out.
In my words, I had assembled many chickens; although some of them have
3 eyes, others have no feathers. But they seem to stand. Considering
that, I am not so far from what I believe is a manuscript that could
be, perhaps, read by this first group, perhaps mutilated. Of course,
this will be a careful and strategic work when this gets in the hands
of a professional editor, since it is known that editors
(professionals included) can miss the style or language. Even the top
ones can miss things, can cut things first and think later.

For many of these materials (sections) it seems to be a non-linear
process, so it seems to be the case that the aggregated sum of
knowledge ends up taking the writer-editor to revisit the materials.
As an example, I removed 120 pages in a day after achieving clarity
about certain things. I would, for now, and if I can, and if you can,
invite or ask you to read one of these chapters, or a section of a
chapter, or perhaps something like a foreword. As in, to alternate a
bit the focus due to the non-linearity and given that all sections
should stand on their own - the chicken should look like a chicken.

Of course, if you have time and If you are interested in considering
some of these chapters. Then, I could perhaps send the index with the
title and a short summary of each. Perhaps, as a suggestion, one to
take a look (which I would think of you) is the one I connect with
Silicon Valley entitled Environment under the Part 1 where I explore
how the rich environment, fast and furious sometimes, set us in a
direction, how tools and methods tell us what to do, how to do and why
to do it; especially now in the networked world.

For now, I say thanks a lot, again, for the comment that you have
given, which is open in my goal setting table. I am revisiting them
again. Nevertheless, you are welcome to print the following, I
recommend printing with 75% and notes on the side. You can mail it.
Or, you can do it in any way you like. In case you are unable to
follow up in any way, at this point, keep in mind that you have helped
me so many times already and the fact that you are there in the
"thanks" section is just another way for me to say thanks. And if the
book gives a chunk of million dollars, I must find a way to sail to
your place and leave the boat.

Hi there, Mr. Gates, or associate colleague supporting founders,

This is Marcio, a brazilian that long time ago worked for Netscape. I returned to Brazil, failed, and watching the Blitzscaling lectures, I noticed that the leaders interviewed were special - and had a readiness level - that seemed to make a difference. 

The book I work, Slow Down to Startup, is to help founders to be conscious of their well-being. I wonder if I may send to you additional info about the book progress.

Hey Eric,

I hope to get to the stage of having a manuscript - for the book (temp
title) Slow Down to Start Up - in the summer, perhaps by June.

I wanted to say thanks to you, again. What I went through is, for me,
the impossible. As an example, I went to about 200 days of writing, as
a writer, about 3-4h per day, not everyday but consistently since last
year.

Writing is not anymore painful, aside from not being necessarily
great. But I found ways to deliver what I wanted to deliver. To do my
part. To kill the initial critic that was confusing me. And then all
started to be a joy.

And, as you well detected, I can't avoid it, to do it in English.
Somehow my connection with the English language is too big. It was a
big fight for years. But all the expressions I know and all the
business books I followed or experiences I refer to are given in this
language. It is the language which brought me to access the world of
management, first from the programming languages. The language that
took me to meet you too.

If the manuscript gets hot - if some of the folks I want to read it
like it - I will let you know.

Marcio

## Letter to Doug Leone Sequoia Capital on May 16th 2024 @meta-refid 9993-9393-4444-3344

```
Caro Doug,

This is Marcio Galli, from Brazil. I lived in Silicon Valley, worked
at Netscape back in the 2000s and I am now trying to complete the
manuscript of a book to help entrepreneurs to run their companies more
consciously, especially in the fast-paced and networked world. The
reason for my contact is that you provided an interesting thought
(about fears) which I saw many years ago, one which I had elaborated
an interpretation and wanted, if you have time, to check your views.

A bit more context: Within part 1, a specific chapter entitled Running
has a section which I talk about Fears. In my drafts I have a quote
from you, which I found many years ago and I think it carries a truth.
You gave that as a response to a question from one in the audience
that had wondered how you stay hungry. You mentioned a notion of "raw
fear" driving your movement:

* "It's not something I do consciously. So, back [LAUGH] this, this is
kind of funny to admit, so, once every ten years, that we do a
Myers-Briggs at Sequoia Capital, you know, we, because, things are
going well, so obviously let's have a look. And the last time that was
negative thing I got is the fact I mentioned that once a week I have a
nightmare that I'm being fired by Sequoia Capital and people told me,
boy, if you feel like that imagine how we feel. Now no one's
threatening me, Sequoia Capital is a weak place, we want people to
succeed. It's actually a really fun place on the inside to be. But to
me is just raw, raw fear. I remember walking in the Stanford Mall in
1988, making 67 thousand dollars and not really having enough money to
buy presents. I remember those days, and they didn't feel very good,
so I have this. I still have this fear that I'm going to be poor. I
still have this fear that they're going to throw me out of Sequoia
Capital. I still have this fear that I'm gonna really mess up a
founder. I, I have a great fear, you know, I've been on thirty boards
and I have to admit, I messed up one company really good. Now,
thankfully, I helped a whole bunch of others, but I fear that I have a
huge sense of responsibility. I think fear would be, would be my
number one thing. And it's not something I do, it's not a little game
I play with myself, I actually, it kind of really gets me going. And,
and, it drives me. I think it's a character fault actually, but you
know, that's what it is. [LAUGH]" Doug Leone @ (Stanford Graduate
School of Business, 2014, 45:22)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cl8X02Xd1I

In terms of a potential interpretation, mine came after I found a
quote from Maslow that I think may explore a potential answer:

* "The adult human being is far more subtle and concealed about his
anxieties and fears. If they do not overwhelm him altogether, he is
very apt to repress them, to deny even to himself that they exist.
Frequently he does not know that he is afraid."

Would it be the case that when you mentioned "raw fear" you actually
were in a state of being okay to talk about your goals and values? And
then that took you to fight for, to access knowledge? so that to
brought yourself into accessing the kind of knowledge for getting
things done? In other words, in front of a potential state of anxiety
(fear equals to being blocked as a solution to reduce anxiety) you
likely saw yourself in a good condition to move towards acquiring
knowledge (or the means), which (as well) reduced anxiety. And from
that, the more you entered that space, the more you understood it as a
principle?

Cordiali saluti,

Hi Cal, 

I have been working on Slow Down to Start Up now for about 6-7 years but in the past 200 days it took off, as I faced some transformations as in becoming a writer. I recently bought your book after I started monitoring the emergence of materials related to a calmer or conscious mode of working.
 
I am certain that your material supports the whole work if not it also offers concrete things, like material to cite, as I move forward. 

Anyway, I wanted to let you know of this work that is under construction, and which I hope to reach a manuscript by the end of this month. 

In addition, I make myself available to send you additional information, or to have a session with you, or to send the manuscript, or to let you know of milestones, not sure. 

Anyway this is a pre-contact moment. Thank you for helping people to become better workers. 

Marcio

Hi Doug,

While I didn't reach much of what you wrote and said I always felt a precision or a level of energy or love which I can't express fully but certainly something that characterizes a special person. I would add too that the characterization of your person plus being inside Sequoia means a lot - is what I wanted from one inside a top-tier investment firm.

Your notes about fear, the role of fear, puzzles me yet. Of all the chapters, slots which I brought to this book, the thoughts about fear, I can't yet know where it fits. 

Anyway, and first, I wanted to let you know of this book. Slow Down to Start Up. The book is not to take energy away from the young, their ability to build. It is a call for moving consciously though. 

In case something here rings a bell, in case this finds you in a good moment of life, or perhaps interested in the theme, I then invite you to help in any way you can. I could, for example, send some intro to the book, as some intermediary material for your appreciation. Or the manuscript, when ready. My hope is to detect the good things in it, to get some feedback from the good minds that care about the movement of entrepreneurs.

## Letter to Andrew Chen on 6 May of 2024

```
Hi folks from SF office,

I think that this message should be addressed to Andrew exactly
because he is quite involved in a world (networked and fast) that has
a potential for good and bad things; and as we know, in the end, he is
optimistic. I know too that Andrew is not unaware of the potential
where some of the networked modern systems may give to many people,
like people with less ability to reason calmly, a perhaps situation of
being trapped.

Since I am writing a book about 'slowing down' as a means to make good
start ups, and concerned with potential founders to be trapped into
building weak things, I wanted to make sure this book maintains the
good energy that founders need. If you could forward the following
invitation to Andrew, I appreciate it.

Sincerely,

Marcio

PS: Letter to Andrew Chen - an Invitation to consider a review, or to
add input to Marcio's strategic writing, for Slow Down to Startup

Hi Andrew,

I am Marcio Galli. I am a Brazilian that had the opportunity to be
invited to work at Netscape, back in the days but not the days which
Marc and Ben where there. Actually, I was sort of invited in those
days of 1997 but I had to win a contest, which I failed miserably as a
result of building a too complex demo, which delayed my chances but
anyway the some good leftover evangelists brought me in 2000 which
gave me a chance to help Netscape during the Mozilla days.

Anyway, life events brought me to enter a last thing in the world I
would think of me - to become a writer. And to consider to write to
founders without a proper success, as measured by the metrics we know,
and too to get into writing about consciousness for entrepreneurship,
something that I didn't have during my attempts, likely failures. To
shorten my story, back in the university days I was the "fastest typer
in the west." Over time, I noticed that the backspace key of my
keyboards was the highest used key. People looking from distance
always said good things - oh, look how fast he is. Even during the
1997 days of Netscape, an employee once said "Marcio, whatever you are
smoking keep doing that." That "smoking" indeed gave me good things,
access. But it didn't me retention inside of me, the retention in the
heart, the retention in terms of observing growth, real growth of the
being as an individual which is key for leadership, which may require
a calmer movement.

Maybe this short story rings a bell to you - that justifies a session
with me. My goal is this: Since the book is about slowing down, and
consciousness, I want to be also conscious that I am not taking energy
away from founders. I want to tell them to do it, but to do it
consciously,  about a state of well-being which is key to make a good
organization.

What I have yet is a manuscript, which I hope that in the end of this
month it may be readable. This is before final professional editor
involvement. I also hope from my conversations to identity the right
editor to complete the book and launch.

MD,

There are too many areas where your thoughts appear in the materials
of the book - Slow Down to Start Up - which makes me think that it is
worth it for me to ask you if you could try to take a look. I thought
about sending the printed pages, perhaps for the foreword, for the
intro, and for one of the chapters, as a starting point and perhaps, I
hope, by May or June. This may turn out to be 50-60 pages.

So, to send to you some pieces of it as a test to see if what I did
has value; with the hopes that the material can be good for our future
founders, our colleagues, of the "big company" of the world where so
many teams are "competing," but as we know all working together. A
point for a value which I hope to get, aside from specific notes given
by the reading experience: I believe that reading by smart people that
cares might lead to connecting with a good editor to help finish, one
that is sensitive aside from being professional. I wish, if I could,
approach publishing it by this summer. But I have no idea now how
close I am. This is a bit like a big railroad for me which I don't
fully know how to manage. The following are notes about some
connections that gave me a "soft yes" as in I may try to read:

* Soft yes for reading - Barbara said a "soft yes," to see it. This
"soft yes" is how I explain the situation where one may or may not
read but replies accepting me to send. Her inclination to look had
happened after I mentioned to her that I spend more than 150 days, as
a job, writing consistently. By now, it's been near 200 days and the
average 3h went up towards 6h per day. I may also try to send a piece
of it first, one that she is not in it, before showing to her the
piece where I talk about her, which is a piece highly influenced by
your talk on communications.

* Soft yes for reading - Steve Blank said a "soft yes". I saw
something from Steve Blank in some of his articles and his effort to
try to understand entrepreneurship and looking within art vs.
entrepreneurship. His extensive involvement as a promoter of lean also
brought him to face the challenges of lean when he had collaborated
with the Jobs To Be Done folks, Tony Ulwick and team. I think that is
living perhaps days of looking from perspective and maybe saw how so
many founders try to use lean and do it too fast. Actually his
awareness about this phenomenon, people talking about doing lean but
not doing lean, is a concern he expressed; and likely a point of value
between our works.

* Soft yes for reading - Chris Yeh said a "soft yes" too. The message
to him was shorter but I had indicated to him that the book had its
origins from Blitzscaling. LIkely informed him too that the inflection
point was your talk too that guided me into a more enlightened path.

Aside from your actual possibility of commitment, if you accept to
receive, I will be glad to print and ship pages for the mentioned
selection of sections, to print using 70% zoom thus leaving room for
notes, like strategic notes. As an example, perhaps you could catch
phrases that are meaningful to make a point to the reader, phrases
that conduct, or moments when the reader reaches a potential place. Or
you can use any approach or viewpoint you have and are used to, your
goggles.

It is important to note, though, that you already helped this process
so much, because of interactions given in the past, either provided by
the materials from Harrison Metal or even notes you wrote when I was
trying to figure out and digging into trying to get the meaning of
entrepreneurship and a conscious view for navigating this world.

MG

PS: Of course, if you think of a soft yes (as in I am okay to receive
the material) but want it digital, I am okay to send as well using
that format. Anyway, I am already thankful for what you did in the
past. Nothing further shall be bigger than what was given because I am
only here because of that past.

## Letter of thank you to John Lilly from 04/15/2014 @refid 0303-4444-3344-3333
* Sent via Facebook, messaging. 

```
Ping John, hope you are good. Hey this topic might seem a bit arbitrary but it turns out that given the circustamces of what I am doing your name comes to my unconscious thinking if not to the clear thinking as I continue to work. So, this is an FYI note and a thank you note, first and mostly. 

Anyway, I had approached Chris Yeh likely about 6-8 months ago to tell him that I had entered a more serious path writing a book - which has a temporary title "Slow Down to Start Up" and had started (although the dots didn't connect) slowly around 2016-2017 when watching the Blizscaling lectures. If I track the origin, Blitzscaling influenced the whole material although it's seen under a perspective which I sometimes think of as "The side B of Blitzscaling" which addresses a potential complication of the modern world where a fouder may jump to execution and not get the nuanced observation of what it takes to advance with attention to the context, such as to the readiness state of its conscious and well-being, and may even get lost in a world of abundance of methods, tools, frameworks, networks, interaction. It seems that many minds, more minds, are supporting perspectives like that, to slow down, to be calmer, to think through, and the like. 

The work continued to get more serious even before I wrote to Chris, which replied considering the possibility to read/check about the material if he has time/conditions/interest of course. In other words, he gave a soft yes, to know more. From around that point, about 600 hours of writing work went by, about 200 days. I would like to ping you if he say yes to anything further; and if I get data from the external environment that this is special material. 

Anyway, to wrap for now, thank you for being a professor of the Blitzscaling along with your friends and colleagues, and for having connected me back in the days when I asked you if I could do the subtitles in pt-br and you connected me with a person from Greylock that sent to me the subtitles. From the Blitzscaling, a major inflection point was the talk of Michael Dearing which took me to know his work and even to drop notes to him many times and then from that to get to know the work of other great minds, like Barbara Minto, which had helped me too to achieve a state of being a potential writer.

## Letter to Julia Cameron on 11 of February 2024 

```
PS: "Failed to send your message. Please try later or contact the administrator by another method."

Julia, 

First, thank you again. For helping me to destroy the wall I have created in the first place. But not to blame me entirely, a wall that was passed on. In this second attempt into the flow of Morning Pages I think it is fair to say that it flows better, perhaps more likely to what the pages are for. 

I might be a writer by now. And we all are, aren't us? We just don't know it yet - like Benjamin Zander says about Classical Music in his talk The Transformative Power of Classical Music. And like Benjamin, I can now think of that special conductor that knows the truth and does not feel good to walk and talk and be around knowing that everybody is a writer and that they just don't know it yet. 

How come a Brazilian that didn't read a thing in his whole life. One that got mechanized and technologized, anxious and fast doer, find peace in the writing? And writing in English too. It is not possible. Only that truth that you know of would be the key to unlock his power, that power, our power.  

By now, what I am doing with that knowing? I caught myself doing it for me, of course. A material is now happening and has about 580 pages with 50% of it added since last year since I allowed myself to write my way, with errors. This is a material to help entrepreneurs. 

And in addition to that, and the morning pages, I caught myself helping others. I told so many about the Artist's Way and The Right to Write. But I always tell them too that I wouldn't be able to convince them  - that they would have to hear from Julia's words. 

Tricky gap right there. I gave a few books too as gifts, 2 or 3 by now. And one other will find its way into the hands of someone soon, I feel it. One by one we do it, isn't it?

To close this messsage, just to comply with the web form needs that says "Ask Julia," and because I think that the The Right to Write has to exist in Brazilian Portuguese: What are the chances, I wonder, for us to lay that track for Brazilians? We could unlock a nation.  

The best, your friend, 

Marcio

Hi Chris, just an FYI on the "Slow Down to Start Up" book progress. 

While I am not yet sending a manuscript for your appreciation, I wanted to ping that I reached the mark of 140+ work sessions since last year, and a total of 422 hours as a writer. 

Of course, I wanted to report through many interesting episodes but kept controlling myself. Anyway today I am escaping the rule to let you know that I edited the dedication of the book: 

* From - This book is dedicated to the brave ones who slow down with the intent of becoming learners. A true entrepreneur carries a humble spirit, always eager to learn and grow.

* To - This book is dedicated to ourselves in the future - the brave who decides to slow down right when we feel that we have nailed it. When we reset ourselves as learners. To us as entrepreneurs that nurture our humble spirit as the necessary element for growth and change.

It is my hope to complete the manuscript soon, before Bay Area's summer.

Hi Michael,

Just FYI note that Barbara had accepted to read my pre-manuscript
draft for the chapter on communications which for me is a big thanks
to Barbara and Michael but for the world of founders (like founders in
hurry) could be a reflection to rethink what they think communication
is. I do focus more on the "owl problem" and how the approach of
Barbara can go along with the "start-up curve" instead of
communications being used like a off-the-shelf tool for polishing up
things.

To note: Her yes was mainly a sort of yes I will try to read. My plan
is to let you know if the interaction with Barbara goes well.

Hi Barbara,

Since around the time that I had received a note from you - the note
is shown in the picture attached in a t-shirt I made as a reminder - I
was able to write consistently. By now, it's been 134 day episodes of
work, as a writer, or 402 hours.

This book is for entrepreneurs interested in more conscious
entrepreneurial behavior - especially under the complicated and modern
world with so many tools and systems and methods where a lot is urgent
or hyper accelerated and networked. The book was born because I was
trapped in this world and perhaps saw the light.

Among other chapters, I have two that connect with communications. One
of them is the one that makes references to you and your work. On the
personal side, I consider this chapter a thank you note to Barbara
Minto and Michael Dearing.

I wonder if I can send the copy of that chapter to you or you/Adrian
when the manuscript of that chapter is ready. I did my best to
approach the subject in ways to motivate the reader and not to pass on
the teachings or details which they are asked to read in your book;
but to offer them a strategic viewpoint for rethinking communications
and to see it as a way to actually grow themselves as better founders,
and better teams, as opposed to *using* communications such as to
polish things, like post-production, like the urgent world does it,
like what makes them lose opportunities in business and life and among
their colleagues.

If this idea sounds good, I can ship a printed copy to you when I
complete the "manuscript version". Or, I can send a PDF or I can share
an online document using Google Docs, or engage in other ways you may
suggest. Of course, if this is the case, you can engage in any way
that you feel to be appropriate: to just receive, to try to start
reading ig, to read the whole thing, to read and do nothing, or to
engage more. I say that because I understand that my presence in the
middle of great thoughts from great thinkers could well be a reason to
turn gold in garbage.

Abraços,
Cheers,
Marcio

Opa André, tudo bem?

Lembrei de você por interações onde você me ajudou e até trocas de ideias naquele assunto de metas, especificamente OKR e alinhamento e preocupação com educação e aspectos que ajudam empreendedores, além de seriedade com o assunto geral de empreendedorismo e gestão. 

Eu estou escrevendo um livro voltado para empreendedores, intitulado "Slow Down to Start Up", coisa que começou em 2016 de fato, porém não sabia já que tudo começava lento - não poderia 100% ligar os pontos. Com isso dito, para muitos tenha ficado claro o nascimento de um material de gestão. Enfim, este livro  traz reflexões para que empreendedores para que possam "rodar" de forma mais consciente no mundo cada vez mais acelerado, no meio de tantas narrativas, tantos conselhos, movimentos, sistemas, frameworks; que acabam também consumindo o dia a dia dos empreendedores, criando até confusões, desgastes, frustrações, perda da energia criativa, you name it. 

O livro tem vários temas, capítulos, onde um deles é sobre foco, intitulado "Not so radical focus", e intencionado a caminhar com o leitor-empreendedor em um processo mais reflexivo sobre o problema da
gestão com metas. De fato este capítulo promove OKR porém minha estratégia foi em "chamar" OKR para a conversa, fazer uma consulta tipo "o que OKR tem a nos dizer sobre esse problema X?"

Enfim tendo feito essa introdução e lhe comunicando sobre sobre o livro e o capítulo, primeiro gostaria de lhe agradecer - porque você esteve presente no meio de tantas conversas que fiz, com profissionais
envolvidos, e com isso logicamente agradeço porque eles me levaram a trabalhar neste livro de forma direta ou indireta.

Com isso dito, eu gostaria de lhe convidar, caso tenha interesse no tema do capítulo, em dar uma olhada no capítulo lembrando que está na versão rascunho-manuscrito é caracterizado como "cheio de palavras"

Opa Thiago, tudo bem?

Lembrei de você por interações onde você me ajudou e até trocas de ideias naquele assunto de metas, especificamente OKR e alinhamento e preocupação com educação e aspectos que ajudam empreendedores, além de seriedade com o assunto geral de empreendedorismo e gestão. 

Eu estou escrevendo um livro voltado para empreendedores, intitulado "Slow Down to Start Up", coisa que começou em 2016 de fato, porém não sabia já que tudo começava lento - não poderia 100% ligar os pontos. Com isso dito, para muitos tenha ficado claro o nascimento de um material de gestão. Enfim, este livro  traz reflexões para que empreendedores para que possam "rodar" de forma mais consciente no mundo cada vez mais acelerado, no meio de tantas narrativas, tantos conselhos, movimentos, sistemas, frameworks; que acabam também consumindo o dia a dia dos empreendedores, criando até confusões, desgastes, frustrações, perda da energia criativa, you name it. 

O livro tem vários temas, capítulos, onde um deles é sobre foco, intitulado "Not so radical focus", e intencionado a caminhar com o leitor-empreendedor em um processo mais reflexivo sobre o problema da
gestão com metas. De fato este capítulo promove OKR porém minha estratégia foi em "chamar" OKR para a conversa, fazer uma consulta tipo "o que OKR tem a nos dizer sobre esse problema X?"

Enfim tendo feito essa introdução e lhe comunicando sobre sobre o livro e o capítulo, primeiro gostaria de lhe agradecer - porque você esteve presente no meio de tantas conversas que fiz, com profissionais
envolvidos, e com isso logicamente agradeço porque eles me levaram a trabalhar neste livro de forma direta ou indireta.

Com isso dito, eu gostaria de lhe convidar, caso tenha interesse no tema do capítulo, em dar uma olhada no capítulo lembrando que está na versão rascunho-manuscrito é caracterizado como "cheio de palavras"
até em excesso. Eu entendo que muito do conteúdo pode ser reduzido, no processo de edição profissional adiante, mas que, neste momento, penso que é melhor estar cheio do que vazio e assim ambíguo. Do jeito que está revela as minhas fontes e intenções.

### Full message left to WhatMatters 

* Left via e-mail to whatmatters - https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/KtbxLxGrVLXDmfpgBSKQwGkDSwBwBtLBdB?compose=new 

```
My name is Marcio Galli, I am now living in Brazil - as an entrepreneur and writer - but in the past had a relative involvement with some iconic Silicon Valley companies like Netscape, Yahoo! and Mozilla. Before I inform you about the contribution that I am giving to entrepreneurs - and one specific about OKR - the following opening should inform you of this book that I have started in 2016 in slow pace after watching the Blitzscaling lectures and it is by now quite active after I have passed the mark of 128 days of work since April of 2023.

This book is entitled "Slow Down to Start Up," and it is intended to help entrepreneurs with a reflective approach as the abundance of data/models/frameworks/systems/platforms can be confusing to them. The motivation came from my struggles and then the observation that the people behind Blitzscaling (professors or the people interviewed) seemed to be good in terms of psychological characteristics like integrity, character, calmness, reflective thinkers, and the like. Therefore, I wanted to help others to engage in ideas like "Wait, hold on, before moving too fast with any frameworks or even advices," also because the startup hypermarket has now too many aisles and too many offerings. 

With this context, and being specific to OKR, I have a chapter entitled "Not so radical focus," which aside from any poor development from my side, as a conductor-writer, it exists because of my honest intention to serve as a reflective opportunity before anyone jumps too fast into OKR; where a possible engagement like an urgent move could set them to be frustrated with OKR, or confused, and worse to give up not only OKR but the concerns and learning about management based on goals. Therefore, the chapter - by the viewpoint of the book - invites the reader-entrepreneur to engage in the subject while OKR is not pushed, or introduced, as a playbook or anything like that since we know that we have a lot of that which is well done as you know, but it is brought alongside the theme as if I am "asking the OKR view about certain challenges." 

With this note I wanted to first let you know of this work but also to invite you to look at the draft-manuscript of this chapter. Or, if you look at it you may also pick or follow up by asking anyone that you know to get involved, if you feel that my work can be helpful to the world of founders. 

Sincerely, 

Marcio S Galli

## Letter - To MD in the McCallum article - On January 28th 2024 

* https://medium.com/@mcgd/thank-you-daniel-mccallum-133d27e98468

```
Inspired now and likely with some confusion but anyway ... When Reid Hoffman asked Michael if the approach of McCallum seemed to be micromanagement (this is inside Blitzscaling Lecture 03) which may be interpreted as such, I have remembered of the Mozilla team's invention known as Bugzilla which was BTW one of the most impactful product around that no one knew (why bother to tell others you are using a key open source component to get your things done) but anyways my point is:
That management grows in maturity by establishing micro management systems so that management surrenders from the micromanagement towards accessing values of another order. The creation of bugzilla was the natural automation of what would be a saturated condition of management - unacceptable inside Netscape and Mozilla - but acceptable through a system where people would do by what can be considered even volunteering work or protactive work. The non-interference of management into that matter is the realization that the matter becomes business as usual.
Now from that creation of the management, stepping away, they either accelerate the team into a whole failure or accelerate the tem into the opportunity; assuming that the new medium of interaction - where micro management is not anymore witnessed which was the case of Bugzilla - becomes a source for a friendly and heated activity where creation in the sense of a marketplace happens with no fights; and furthermore in ways that generates value to the major goal of the team.
It may be so that the management situation deals with unbundling a bundled condition - such as how we know to get things done - by bundling a marketplace in it that elevates the growth and value generation.

## Letter - Informing Jim Barksdale of Netscape 

```
When I search inside myself - often there is nothing much I really do there - but it seems that the figure of Jim Barksdale appears again and again and I have to put upfront that I am not mistic as far as I know except if there are outside things I don't know of governing my intentions. Anyways if Jim appears more it may be - as far as I know - due to some iconic aspect of him and from the days of Netscape. While I didn't read much of what he were writing - and I may get into that I hope - I seemed to respect his figure that kept me able to learn about the browser and later to get a job at Netscape although sadly I did'tn meet him.

Today I have found - https://www.msreads.org/about-the-institute/the-barksdales/ which refers to Barksdale Management Corporation which when I queried on Linkedin I have found https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-b-cannada-47b27a12/ Don to be the CEO but Donna his wife runs the Barksdale reading institute  https://www.msreads.org/contact/  I am hereby pleased and interested in sending them a copy of the manuscript not only due to showing them a connection but also in alignment with the life of a non-reader and non-writer that had to become a writer and better reader.

Hi Michael,

I hope that you are well. I continue to move on in a quite consistent
way (episode 124 since April of last year) in a book for entrepreneurs
- and people that care about them and the future generations. Your
name appears on it but more than that it appears as a force that has
given me the means to believe.

I am attaching a draft of the Introduction to one of the chapters, Not
so Radical Focus, where you had contributed indirectly such as through
the footnotes linked.

With this note, my goal is to give you a heads up and material example
of what I am doing, first. In addition, it is an invitation for you to
get involved in any way you can. In other words, if you find it
interesting I would love to send the manuscript when ready for your
appreciation.

Of course, I understand that receiving it is one thing, looking at it
another, and so on. My point is that I am okay with any kind of
feedback and also happy anyway. In other words, I am thankful to you
for the many thoughts that you have given to us entrepreneurs via your
online materials.

There are at least two other chapters where you are present. One of
them is "Making peace with communications" which is an introduction to
SCqA and Executive Communications which focuses on the strategic
perspective of that kind of involvement with communications that can
go along with the growth of the entrepreneur, more than a
communication as a tool that is used when one wants to polish things,
after the fact.

Sincerely,

Marcio

## Letter - Asking for reference confirmation - [feat. Michael Dearing @ Harrison Metal]

* status - not sent 

```
Subject - Marcio's book - Slow Down to Start Up -  Referencing that 250-survey that confirms that successful entrepreneurs love clear communication about objectives

Hi Michael or team,

I wanted to reference a note from Michael from GM2 [1] course about a survey. I think part of the good data, Michael notes, is in the video but also there seems to be part available as a PDF [2]. I wonder if I could link to the PDF or if you have more on that survey. The context of my intention to link/refer to is the following:

I have a paragraph, in a material that I am working on [3], which basically is an easy to understand phrase that says that people of success will love to know clearly what they are doing and how they are progressing. In order to add a supporting point to that, I would love to link to Michael's discovery from the GM2 course - a note about the survey with 250 workers.

Would you think is fine if I make a footnote, referencing the GM2 course but moreover I wonder if could link to the PDF [2] too or even better if you have any specific public writing  on that survey.

## Revisinting a letter to Michael Dearing 

* Marcio wrote the following in March 15, 2021, to Michael Dearing. Michael replied and pointed that Schumpeter would consider some of that to be like "creative destruction at the level of the individual rather than the economy."

```
The founder-entrepreneur spirit, their way of living, is probably related to one being a bit frustrated with the world as it is. But not in the sense of not being grateful. 

Consider respect for others. They are mad about where we are. But if you try to tell them that the world is the same or worse than before, they will certainly be mad at you. What they see — different from many — is the founder-function within. They see what freedom fighters did, they feel empathy for the fight. Perhaps this thinking explains the founder-within function that makes a professor-investor-mentor look at stories such as of Harriet — the lady that optimized and scaled an iterative system and method for freeing slaves. 

But to exercise the founder-within, the founder needs to embrace their new person / new manager, necessarily. They can't face breaking the world, unfolding what's next, unbundling then bundling; without accepting their evolution, their change. It's impossible. 

Such founder spirit acts at the intersection between management for the known things and management for what is next. And this is exactly the stage, the context, and struggle, where they try to bring order from chaos. This aligns with how they consistently bring the word art on top of science. 

When Michael showed to Reid the case of Daniel McAllum, Reid wondered if McCallum was doing micromanagement. But at that moment micro-management didn't exist. McCallum's creation was *actually in fact* in the field of trying to propose methods for self-management for what was never done before, for what could not be done with the world and things as they knew it. One could even consider that he was trying to create a culture. 

One practical visualization of this is Bugzilla  — the issue-tracking and management system that was invented at Netscape in order to help with the development of the Mozilla Browser railroad, back in the days. Netscape Client Product division, building 21, was doing something new in terms of management. Eventually, Bugzilla was deployed in full-blown style at the whole building. Everyone was using Bugzilla to create issues, to ask for help, to add comments, to triage problems of all sorts. It was one of the most successful products of management. It was a system and method and the whole building was using it. They were micro-reporting things not usually done that way. And, by the way, that didn't grant the browser to survive at that point in time, necessarily. 

Yet and sticking to that Netscape story, here is another great note that depicts the inflection point when Netscape released Mozilla source to the open. From the words of Jim Barksdale, we can see proof that management was exercising new management — 

"Well, it's certainly my hope that the enormous amount of new people that no one could afford to have working on any product, now contributing to the Netscape Navigator Communicator, will make a significant difference in the improvement of the product. How that works against any competitor; remains to be seen. " Barksdale, Jim, 2013, 29min56sec. https://youtu.be/4Q7FTjhvZ7Y?t=1796 

It goes on and on and on. For now, I can't ask anything specific for new founders. One thing perhaps is applicable. Time. We need to watch out for how we run our actions in time. It is about time to allow time for the self.

## Letter to Jordan Peterson - Thank you for the writing process 

* https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/QgrcJHsBpWMxPGPCSWFDjHLfgbcGpDGlKJb

```
Hi Jordan,

I have seen a lot of interesting short videos from you and had an idea
that you had substance under these messages - by the very fact that
the messages seemed quite clear. But that was that. Then, one day, I
gave your book as a gift to my sister in law. And that was that. But
then, I had stumbled at your notes regarding writing and quite at the
very surface of your thoughts on that, I felt it was a moment to say
hello and thanks.

Therefore, thank you, for spreading the word about writing and to
bring up the interesting aspects of a process that, as you know, many
of us simply don't get it right. In the book that I am working - and
which is part of my self discovery process as writer or as a thinker
or as a person - which I started about 6 years ago, I may have finally
entered into the beginnings of a promising path now. Which likely took
me to visit the basics of your thoughts on writing.

One part in particular, the idea of throwing 80%, came at the right
time and right before I started to mess up with the material. My
situation is this, in short: I happened to have started the book work
around 6 years ago, not exactly sure where it would go. Then big
pauses. But then, this year, I felt good to go and it went through
well - also with support from Julia Cameron's The Right to Write. With
that, I am now at 100 episodes of work almost every day, the material
went from 250 pages - unstructured - to 500-600 pages with a
relatively better structure, for me, due to the "right to write" by
lowering the critic and some other helpful methods or models.That
brought me to be fascinated with some ideas I had arrived at, likely
related to achieving clarity through the process.

But then a complication came; related to the notion that I had to
control not to grow in pages, as if I had to deal with reducing. But
the real complication which is now clear due to your ideas, seems to
be the conflict of interests - like the author of the first draft with
the editor which pulls the self critic. Some good ideas seemed to be
in the air, as in "should I just let it grow?" or "Should I cut
later?" But these were not strong enough.

This is where your ideas helped. The thoughts such as the image that I
could cut 80% of it later. But a lot of what I saw in a video that
someone had edited from you, related to writing, seems o be quite
clear and strong.

Therefore, I had downloaded your essay on writing to study it too.

Thanks,

Marcio

Hey Eric, 

How things. I am working in a book entitled Slow Down Startup which I believe it may support entrepreneurs with more conscious entrepreneurship in the face of the too many options, too many of-the-shelf solutions for advancing.

It's sort of a book for even before starting. 

Your name has appeared across over a few areas because of the concerns and consciousness viewpoint that you provided such as when you are concerned with the entrepreneurs, or teams, their behaviors that prevent them to access purpose accross their siloed focus. 

I wonder, if I can first send you a PDF that has an overview of the structure of the book, as a way so that you can know of my in progress work which is BTW about 6 years although I started slow and not so clear. In the past 6 months I am writing almost every day though, so I believe the process looks now closer to real writers. 

Sincerely, 

Marcio

Hi Adrian, 
Thanks again for that day to be in the session. I am sending this draft of the overview of my book, which is so far entitled Slow Down Startup and meant to help founders and supporters of entrepreneurship in a world where everything seems to be too fast. 
If you can please take a look, I would appreciate. And apologies for the draft condition. In addition, I wanted to let you know that I am consistently writing - and for the actual core writing process not using ChatGPT. By now, after 90 episodes of work done consistently since I had returned to work in this book earlier this year, I know that it was the best thing to do - Barbara's note to me helped. 

It could be that I have started to grasp what it means to be a writer, of course, by the practice, the doing, in the everyday. Yes, some ChatGPT usage happens, like drafting the APA citations, and some footnotes too, but not to a point to mess up with my brain and to prevent style, flow, and other benefits from happening. 

Another point and reason of my contact, besides to let you know all this, is to wonder if you happen to be working in a way or another with writing, or anything related to the world of entrepreneurs; and if so or if you happen to see a reason to engage, even if it is to take a look, I would love to send you the manuscript when ready. 

Cheers, 

Marcio

* Ref 42849289-42984982-92484928-20849284, conversation followup on Linkedin.

(If you want I can e-mail this if you give me your e-mail) 

Hi David, 

What I am about to inform you might be a result of one amateur writer, amateur entrepreneur, wantrepreneur, wannabe writer - you name it - that had received help to become a writer from the perspective that a writer starts with the act of writing.

In this context, Hackernoon, of course, had offered help, a space, an opportunity. In addition, of course, many others like Julia Cameron to name a special name. 

So I am writing a book. Part one of this note. One which I didn't know when navigating the origins of it, by 2017, by that timeframe which BTW I had become an Uber driver for 1000 trips (on Fridays) and somehow the driving took me into writing, which produced the following articles, the first of them on The Ascent, and the other I think youself had approved it when Hackernoon was on Medium - this is when our story begins. 

[Why that first Uber (driver) trip never happened | by Marcio S Galli | Ascent Publication | Medium](https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-that-first-uber-driver-trip-never-happened-2d36a073ebfc)

[Never Send a Business Model Canvas to Your Investors | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/never-send-a-business-model-canvas-to-your-investors-f832fd854518)

To add more to this first point, the book, so far entitled Slow Down Startup, shows a great deal of connection with a point of view - which I can't say yet that it is style - that had in that article about canvas, which has to do with a calmer mind which is necessary for entrepreneurship, especially in the days when all seems to hyperconnected. The draft has about 480 pages I am trying to keep under 500 with the goal of arriving at 250-300 - as if the number of pages were a topic to talk about. 

Now the other point is that I do have, in one of the chapters, a section where I talk about Lean, and Canvas, and somehow I caught myself remembering the reply that you said when I wrote that article ( "Never Send the Business Model Canvas to Your Investor" ) when you published it, as you wrote something like "Oops I just did". 

At this stage, I added added a bit of color, and thoughts, and made a reference to the situation. I had indicated that CEO of a publication when had replied "Oops, I just did" doesn't tell if he were using Canvas wrong or right. But what is more important is that it happens to mean more, that the matter of being aware about the responsible use of lean tools, such as business model canvas, are good themes to be concerned with. In other words, that CEO wanted to remind himself of being aware. 

Now, I would or could perhaps keep that story as that, or also to add a reference in the footnote about Hackernoon and/or your name; so I am asking your permission or it case it is not nice just wonder if I can keep the story without mentioning names or the publication. 

Beyond that, I would very much like to say thanks to you and Hackernoon from a general point of view of having supported my life as a writer. Or perhaps the beginning of it. 

Sincerely, 

Marcio

Hi Ted,

The attachment is to let you know of this project which now has
reached a state of continuous writing based on the past 80 episodes of
work (except time off) while the origins were slow from 2017 when I
started to study the Blitzscaling lectures while as usual trying to
make a company.

In case you happen to want to take a look when the manuscript is
ready, in case the topic interests you in any way, please let me know.

```
Hey Chris,

So I may have touched the subject - of a book - perhaps a few times. I
had started a material - based on studies of the Blitzscaling lectures
around 2017. Not consistently, mostly slides or drafts and articles
came along in an online publication which helped me to advance with an
initial belief of being a writer. But this year, around 6 months ago,
I went back to it and had engaged in a consistent writing path - as in
writing almost every day except time off - 80+ episodes of writing by
now.

The book is for entrepreneurs trying to make startups in the
accelerated and networked world. And may also matter for parents and
anyone like investors, coaches, supporters, as they care about
founders and their future companies.

For now I am attaching a PDF which has the audience, theme, structure
and a personal note about the origins of the book. In case the
material rings any bells, or if you know of a special person that
could be interested too, please let me know and I will be happy to
send the manuscript as any special person and perspectives are always
welcome.

Draft has by now about 500 pages but I will try to get it to become
250-300 if I can and if it does not hurt the value.

Hey Brendan,

I am sure you have entered a path of being busy - focusing on Brave -
but if somehow the theme interests you I would be happy to send the
draft manuscript when ready. Even if it is to take a look to see if it
rings any bells.

The subject of the book deals with the urgency and pressures of the
world, however in the domain of founders (and anyone interested in
helping them like parents or investors) that are motivated to do
startups as in startups to grow.

I started this material around 2017 when I was studying the
Blitzscaling lectures [1] the very course that gave me awareness of a
readiness level - of human beings - that seemed to be important to
make great lasting companies. And I had written drafts, bits and
pieces, then somehow in the last 6 months I had entered a consistent
writing path, one which I never did in my life, as in now writing for
80+ consecutive days aside from pauses like time off and vacation.

The general overview is attached, so that you can appreciate the
theme, audience, structure, and more on origins of the material. In
case it does not ring any bell but you know people that may be
interested in reading the draft manuscript (when ready) I will be glad
to connect.

Sincerely,

Marcio Galli

## Letter to Jason of It Does not Have to be Crazy at Work, November 21th 2023 

* Via linkedin connection,

Hi Jason,

Thanks for connecting. I am Marcio Galli, now living in Brazil, I lived in the Bay Area from 2000-2005 (Netscape, Yahoo! Mozilla). 

Since the days when I started to watch the Blitzscaling course and interviews [1] I started to get a sense of a disconnect between the model/approach of many founders when doing their startups (such as their too fast interaction with lean tools) with what seemed to be a conscious character of some of the folks interviewed.  

In other words, I started to sense  that what it takes to be a great founder was a readiness level, as in, to be short, of a calmer person. I had then found relative awareness that many of the lean tools or methods do provide words of caution although how founders perceive these tools and methods seemed to take them to not read the small letters. 

Then I kept working in drafts but in the past 4-6 months I caught myself writing consistently and it seems to be moving in the direction of a book manuscript - so far entitled Slow Down Startup. 

During this phase I also received a recommendation from a friend to read your book, which I loved and even supported with a sense of - this is right. 

With this openning, I am leaving an introduction presentation in attachment, as PDF, of the work, which attempts to explain the audience, theme, reason/goal and structure. I appreciate if you could take a look. 

With that, and from there, and in case the topic matters or rings any bell, I wonder if you allow me to send the manuscript, aside from any possibility of interaction. 

Thank you for reading my note, 

Thank you for your work.

```
Hey Michael, 

Hope you are doing good. I am working in a book, I figured, after the many years since I came across the Blitzscaling talks. And yours, number 3, was the talk that asked me to stop and learn. 

Taming the critic was critical, as you may sense. The materials I came upon, the insights, are at the same time too basic or too deep. It is likely the best thing I ever came up with. At the same time, I know, it might be wrong, it might be poor, it may be just a baby step in trying to understand the human operating system for when people get into a boat, the boat of entrepreneurs. 

In attachment I have included an intro, like a presentation of the book for an investor role, or a stakeholder, partner, you name it. I am sending this to you, to Chris Yeh, John Lilly.

## Chris Yeh, not sent letter but written on 29/09/2023

* "I know that in moving towards this manuscript I have to sort of be confined a little bit, to hold my emotions or my need to write to some people. But I can't resist this inner drive that made me access a whole new level of passion about entrepreneurship. As I move closer to the manuscript - a guess a milestone - I touched again the Blitzscaling talks, and especially the recap one, which is one you spoke significantly. And I was able to see, in your eyes and your spirit (call it whatever you want I am not religious) how much you really care(d) about the students in that room and the general audience that they represented. Then I felt how humble you were, there, you and the Blitzscaling crew; humble and thankful for having the attention of those students of 183C. " 

## Thanks to Sune Lehmann and Johann Hari, due to resarch of Sune from Stolen Focus 

Thanks for your research. I am working, about 4 years, in a book entitled "Slow Down Start-up" especially for founders. And the research helped to add clarity about what I was referring as "urgent accelerated world. " 

## Paul Graham 

Hi Paul,

Hope that you are doing well. 

Thanks for your writing about writing. I have been going through such discoveries related to writing in the past two years more intensively. And also quite interested and reflecting on the role of writing in developing a start-up.

When I was reading your note [1], I recalled moments of the lectures on writing [2] by Ayn Rand. Likewise to the situation when reading your essay, the reading of her notes also brought me closer to understanding more about the struggles of writing non-fiction connected with the process of writing.

I'm not sure if you have had a chance to read it, but I feel that you will enjoy it. The following are some parts that align with your essay:

* Writing x Unconsciousness - she expressed a lot about the unconscious aspects of writing. She illustrates situations such as a) the importance of writing a draft without engaging in editing vs. other modes of writing such as editing (conscious mode), b) writing a draft without asking for advice (to avoid conflicting conscious with the unconscious). // Ref PG's note is: "In both cases, there were things I didn't consciously realize till I had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous. A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners." [1]

* The idea of the people that write "perfect" at once - She speaks of these people comparing them with somnambulant. In her view, if you wake them up, they can't continue to write. // Ref to PG's note is: "But I've never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than their ability." [1]

She clearly shows herself as the one who had to go from zero to one (10+ years to write a book, etc.) and illustrates many conditions that a writer feels as they move.

Book Slow Down to Win (temporary name)

Hi Paul,

I hope you are well. I am back, hopefully on a better track, working
on a book that helps founders to walk their way with a more conscious
approach. As in to know how to tame the situation you might have
touched when you said "following their instincts" [1].

I would like to invite you to help me with an interview - or
conversation - to get more of your wisdom regarding if you think that
there is a better state of well being that can support
entrepreneurship, if that is a requirement or not, and how to nurture
it.

The Situation-Complication is when a founder (say a beginner-founder)
just tries to grasp what is going on and falls into the possibility of
getting everything wrong, such as to use all the lean ways in wrong
ways. To put an example, of something that you pointed out - that YC
has something for them if they listen - an entrepreneur could well use
that line although enter a poorer acceleration program and end up
listening; which could well push them to say "I wish we didn't listen"
(in the context of a poor accelerator) as opposed to the "I wish we'd
listened" (which works for YC).

This might contextualize the book in a way. So I am using those eyes.
I would say the book could be a response to all the possible "entry
points for entrepreneurship" but using a "hold on there" point of
view. It seems to touch on the psychology of human beings x
entrepreneurship.

Although I did say the interview, I don't have a specific set of
questions for you, PG. But I can work them out. Or, I can join you in
call to have a more open conversation with you about speed, urgency,
slowing down, and the state of being that could better save them from
being "accelerated" into the wrong ways.

In case this topic is interesting, I would love to have the
opportunity to listen to you, and to get your point of view about this
theme.

Sincerely,

Marcio

[1] "The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that
startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a
lot of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them. When I was running Y Combinator I used to
joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore.
It's really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders
about mistakes they're about to make, and the founders ignore them,
and then come back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened." -
