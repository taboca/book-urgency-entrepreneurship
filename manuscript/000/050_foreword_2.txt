This book, 'Slow Down to Win', stands as a testament to my journey from struggling entrepreneur to reflective author. A journey that started not from a grand success story or a breakthrough invention, but rather from a personal emotional awakening catalyzed by my own failures and the frustrations they brought along.

The question, "Who am I to author such a book?" arises not infrequently. In 2016, I set out to create a startup. Like so many others, I felt the urgency to accelerate, to move as fast as the world around me. Time and again, my haste led me to stumble, and each failure, each setback, left me with a deeper sense of frustration. It was these very emotions, these "clippings" of my entrepreneurial journey, that served as the fuel to ignite a change in perspective.

In her work "The Right to Write", Julia Cameron highlights how emotion can be harnessed to incite creativity:

"Rather than burn the clippings, toss the clippings, or bury them in a drawer and try to forget or ignore the clippings, I reminded myself that emotion was fuel and I might as well use my hurt feelings to write."

So, I began to leverage my emotional fuel, utilizing my struggles and frustrations as a lens to critically examine the landscape of entrepreneurship. I noticed a common pattern among founders: we were all entranced by the speed of the world around us, often skimming the surface of valuable resources, hastily employing tools without fully understanding their essence. In our race to success, we risked missing the heart of the message.

I found the data hiding in plain sight—in video interviews, articles, comments, reflections from successful and failed entrepreneurs, investors, and practitioners. The patterns of conscious entrepreneurship were there, but they were often obscured by the urgency in our approaches. From this, I derived the essence of 'Slow Down to Win'. It is not about moving slowly; it is about taking the time to understand and learn before taking the leap.

Continuous learning, transparency, and virtuous behavior emerged as three fundamental pillars in my observations. They form the backbone of the message I wish to share. I believe in the necessity of shedding the fast-track entrepreneurial narrative in favor of a more conscious, measured approach—one that values learning as an ongoing process, promotes transparency, and encourages ethical behavior.

I want to challenge the traditional narrative that views entrepreneurship as a high-stakes gamble. Instead, I posit that it is a journey of constant learning, a celebration of the process leading to success. My experiences have led me to realize that the true value of entrepreneurship often lies in the overlooked moments, the instances we often dismiss in the rush of our journey.

This book is not merely a culmination of my journey—it's an open invitation for others to embark on their own path of awakening. It's my hope that by sharing my insights, other entrepreneurs will recognize the power of slowing down to win, leveraging their own emotions and experiences to fuel a more conscious, insightful approach.

At the heart of this book, 'Slow Down to Win', is a journey—one that takes us from the struggle of silencing judgement to the revelation of writing a book for founders and entrepreneurs. But what makes this voyage unusual is its origin. You might ask, "Who am I to author such a book?"

Indeed, the inception of this book can be traced back to 2016 when I, with aspirations of creating a startup, seemed to accelerate towards failure. I am not a groundbreaking inventor or an accomplished manager, nor have I made a fortune by scaling a business. In fact, my friends often know me as a solo voyager, preferring to tackle challenges on my own. Despite this, I assert that the principles laid out here are vital for founders, entrepreneurs, and those eager to lead others.

Can someone pen a book on entrepreneurship, or guide others in launching a startup, without having achieved conventional success, such as overseeing a phenomenal scale-up success story or a similar major event? The answer, which also lends life to this book, originates from a revelation I had.

Everywhere I looked, the patterns of conscious entrepreneurship were being shared by all our heroes. However, these patterns were often obscured in the fast-paced rhetoric of their articles, introductions, and even the core systems they promoted. I began to see that for every modern, fast-paced entrepreneurial method, founders were being entranced by the urgency of our fast-paced world, leading them to misuse these tools.

This is not a tale of your typical successful founder or entrepreneur, but the insights within this book emerged from my journey of slowing down, reflecting, and realizing that the signs urging us to decelerate our processes are already there. They can be found in video interviews, articles, books, comments, and reflections from successful and failed entrepreneurs, investors, and practitioners alike.

In 2016, when I began watching the Blitzscaling lectures, I observed that robust startups thrived on a foundation of continuous learning, transparency, and virtuous behavior. I was inspired to share these insights and began developing a sense of duty towards promoting what I felt was a more ethical, conscious approach, diverging from the typical fast-track entrepreneurial way of acting that seemed to be happening.

This conscious approach is underscored by a quote from Julia Cameron's "The Right to Write":

"Rather than burn the clippings, toss the clippings, or bury them in a drawer and try to forget or ignore the clippings, I reminded myself that emotion was fuel and I might as well use my hurt feelings to write."

In other words, the emotional fuel for this work was on my side. As I took the time to listen to Blitzscaling talks at a slower pace, I was reminded of the importance of continuous learning, transparency, and virtuous behavior.

The willingness to share the process without waiting for any sign of conventional success makes this book—and your entrepreneurial journey—possible. This book is a part of my lifelong learning process, and it's not over; it's transparently available for discussion and conversation. Reed Hastings' comment on Netflix's culture deck exemplifies this notion:

"One of the great things about putting things in writing is that it makes it more debatable, and so it's not just hearing a sermon and it’s like, “Okay, that’s nice,” but you can comment on, “You know, this part here that we wrote down doesn’t really seem appropriate, or doesn’t seem what we do.”

Entrepreneurship isn't a gamble, it's about celebrating the learning process, the story before the grand success. This book is an extraction of those moments, the gems often overlooked in the urgency of the entrepreneurial journey. We are here pausing to reflect on the things we do wrong that, while they may lead to thriving organizations, often come at a personal cost.

Learning, transparency, and virtuous behavior are the three pillars that support the approach championed in this book. This emphasis on learning is echoed by Reid Hoffman in his description of Brian Chesky, Airbnb's founder, as an "infinite learner."

> "The term that I use for it is infinite learners, and you're actually one of the people I use as an example. Because literally the very first time you and I did a press event, it was the first time that I had done a press event with an entrepreneur in my portfolio where the very first question you asked me when we got off the stage was 'What should I have done better?'"

This book is a culmination of my journey, from a fast-paced entrepreneurial mindset to a more conscious, deliberate approach. It's an invitation for you to join me on this path and discover the power of slowing down to win.
