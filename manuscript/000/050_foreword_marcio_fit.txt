* outline - Introduction - Pitch - Who should talk about entrepreneurship? The things we listen. 
--> 

A lot of writing that attracts the attention of entrepreneurs are written by others or even the very entrepreneurs that are successful - as seen by the current critics that will surely listen to whatever they say in the first place; even if what they say gets a great reviews to just fit properly under the expectation of audiences. In other words, why would a publisher talk about the ideas from the losing side of the battle? It is important to say though that among the successful doers there are a lot of true heroes of capitalism having done businesses valuable to the society, to customers, to their collaborators, and likely to the coragerous investors that had entered their boat when all were small. This is not the case of this author, if filters like that had to be applied in the filter-first think-later paradigm of selection. When I became a volunteer for Mozilla - the not-for-profit organization that created the popular Firefox browser - and people asked me what I do, my answer were that I work for a non-profitable organization. A simplification I used to get from local-network analysis showed signs of myself beingn a sort "a founder that is generally alone that needs a cofounder."  

We all agree that there are just too many variables involved if anyone wanted to organize, reflect, and attempt to write in an organized way the complexities and the struggle of many entrepreneurs that aren't successful by the eyes of normal critics. What is not confusing though, is the effort that many can put to assemble the bits and fragments from heroic stories, and even organize them in ways that audiences loves and even buys-in. That is likely why we look at the successful cases, and their stories. So we try, in retrospect, to grasp what had happened. A lot of that exists already in the market of educational resources. Still, a major problem though is that the assembling of recipes, or methods or frameworks or else, comes from reflections that are highly based in analysis in retrospect, taken from stories from the successful cases which may not fully embody a level of nuances of the struggle that founders generally go through; of course not only founders but that anyone involved in supporting the actual startup situation. And that can't be a pure interest to sell more such as where stories told and organized as steps are applicable to the audience in their arrempt to replicate success. To be fair, there is a degree of focusing in what is right and what fits. In other words, justice needs to be done for the successful stories so the focus on what matters goes with being pragmatic and by that it also pleases the audience. To illustrate an example, when Brian Chesky was asked what how to select cofounders [^foonote_brian_cofounders], he had acknowledged that he was lucky and that his cofounder was a long time friend which he trusted and admired. With that, he inferred the importance of admiring the person next to you as you will be working around them for long hours.  

[^foonote_brian_cofounders]: Brian Chesky discussed his experience with selecting cofounders (2015, Blitzscaling, 1h23min) in the context of starting Airbnb. He noted the role of luck and his pre-existing relationship with his cofounder, and with that and given their successful relationships, were able to highligh the importance of trusting connections, or being around people you enjoy working, and more.

* outline - introduction - situation - Abundance of resources can be found, everywhere.
--> 

But then, in front of that, and under the heavy pressure for getting things done, and listening to the clock ticking, and witnessing the resources passing to the other side of the sand clock, we find our ways in the affairs of these best ideas first. These are the things to listen first. We then visit and revisit their resources, we learn and engage with their frameworks, we listen to their theories, we access and even ride along with these role models, though from far with their videos or thought fragments recorded. We play by their rule books, we get into conversations, we become part of many communities, we join networks, and we dive and become a great swimmer in an ocean of methods and ideas where all seem to work. Any movement in this ocean means possibility. Entering the entrepreneurship space changed in ways because now anyway first will visit the modern hypermarket and pick up things. There, there are the aisles for the many stages and situations - from being inspired, getting started, the lean shelf, role models, frameworks, methods, guides, platrforms, everything. All offerings are shining, it is all colorful and properly arranged. They all seem to be promising, they are all beatifully branded. A motivated entrepreneur in that space is hungry and will find all they need to put in the cart. And if that isn't enough, they will also find lots and lots of offerings that are very cheap. But we know - the entrepreur kind is not a common shopper - they do the math too, they compare products, even if they are too hungry. They filter first for coherence, of course. But if it rings the bells, they do flip the cover of the package and read the nutritional facts. And there, they will see that a lot of it is not a lie. Proper facts are given, even small letters of warning. All of that, that abundance of options for the entrepreneurial journey, is available because it is a product, or by-product, of the very active capitalism that brought us here.

--> 

And we may run the risk - by trying to be productive - of becoming too urgent. We may run the risk of having a quite full cart with things we didn't want. Therefore, on the other side of our own realities and when it is time to apply execution - with the tools and methods and guides and principles and a lot more - we seem to feel a gap, as in to notice that something that seem not right. Is it my cofounder? Is it my network? Should I learn again the process? Should I do more and faster? In other words, that they seem to not be in the right temperature and pressure. Oh, if we where in Silicon Valley, would things be different? Oh, we may need a cofounder.

* outline - introduction - complication - Alone to reason on behaviors, not even seem part of entrepreneurship. 
--> 

And into that journey, of course by the nature of the process, we do get an idea that we might be the problem, such as that our behaviours are in the way. But still, what could be the ways? Does anyone talk about that? And it becomes complex because in front of what to do, falling into a "performance track" seems to be an option - such as "should we focus in the prototype given that we are engineers and designers?" In other words, we try with what we have. But still, although we can be in the middle of a number of interactions in the hyperconnected space, we are quite alone. Alone, anyways, if the theme has to do with us, our behaviours. It is quite lonely too because "entering this room" could lead to further concerns such as to wonder if the individuals need psychotherapy - or if that is not a clear visualization still some ideas may float around the wonderings about the behaviours of individuals influencing the system. But even if one brings about these considerations, still we won't exactly be sure which direction to move further as the management perspective seems to, again, work by an assumption of the controlled temperature and pressure, or to hope that by assuming that the entity of business under its pressure and hopes for solvency, brings about the best of humans, or to in a way or another select the best humans.

* outline - introduction - question - should we care?
--> 

But then, and likely fair, many would likely not care to access, likely not from that door anyway, the space where the human operating system influences the space of the entrepreneurial effort. This is a perspective not generally spoken. After all, to name a few reasons, people are different and we hope that the machine of collaboration in entrepreneurship helps to fix that.

* outline - introductin - answer - answer is everywhere, we as audiences are not reading the signs. 
--> 

Still, these concerns are everywhere, in the discussions, conversations that are happening in the "hallways" of the corporate building, such as meetings, blogs, rants from the doers, and more. And furthermore, even in the very interviews with them heroes. They are telling us, and loud and clear, about the so many nuances and things of the nature of behaviors. Now, if these problems are real, and even if these conversations seem to be less professional, yet we have good reasons to be consider the subject, such as that we are concerned (a) and (b) that we might be trying to advance by patching the average day, where it is not uncommon us to be moving with arbitraty discussions; which may also be a result of us not having a specific perspective that can help us.  

In the direction to this perspective, we may then try to establish certain values. We know that they are in it to go for it, and also that a lot is not really working. In addition, that that they want to thrive, to achieve success. But it also the case, by necesssity of the situation - even though not noticeable - they should care about their health. That, exactly because the unhealthy state - and we don't have to dig much into the different conditions of human - can't minimally listen, can't learn, which is a premise for the entrepreneur. And the potential conflict, in the sense of conflict of interests of the self, happens as we fail with us, we may "bend" the machine a little bit, or more or less, aiming that a future better results can put us in a better place; which goes inline with that old idea of working too much, which involves acceptable losses in the way, and by that going towards retirement. 

But that inclination does not work anymore, especially in the modern entrepreneurial situation of a highly iterative and highly interactive world, given that the commitment to execution can't yield precision, because course-correction needs to happen, much more, in realtime. Thus, from the perspective of the individual, you can't anymore set your car in one direction, accelerate and expect results to happen, such as to recover the losses and wrong bets, to pay the bill. 

In other words, if the conversations of feedback, such as strategic conversations, need to happen much more, we not only need healthy conditions to have those but also the right perspective, minimally to set the angle of concern, one possible being - if we have a much more dyncamic world of options, and if a lot of resources are promising, we can also be wasting our attention not only to fail with the success that we want to our entreprise, but also failing with this internal readiness level of success - the individual health and their psychological health - which we may not even notice it.  

Now, just like I said that I didn't do a thriving and successful business by the eyes of the critics, or what we may see as normal critics; I can't also confirm having lost myself, such as the conditions that entrepreneurs may find themselves like burnout. I would say that I got stuck in the middle, which is likely a place that many leave - for a while or forever - but nevertheless do not bother to document, not even to reflect. In this journey which was not the end, which naturally involves more learning, I had started to notice voices that seemed to support in this direction, to my surprise quite clear from the interviews of the Blitzscaling lectures. In other words, through studying Blitzscaling, I started to sense that the people involved in the startups that had achieved success, seemed to be calmer, seemed to be people reading much more, seemed to not follow one or other framework too strictly, seemed to be aware. On the other hand, the anxiety of entrepreneurs, seemed to set themselves to miss listening these voices. This is the gap I caught myself in. Therefore, this book, for me, is a bit like the B side of Blitzscaling.
