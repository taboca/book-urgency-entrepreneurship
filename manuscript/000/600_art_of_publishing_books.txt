## On the art of publishing 

* Self-publishing - advice - [feat. Christina Vodtke] https://womentalkdesign.com/2023/08/christina-wodtke-on-self-publishing/ 

* Self-publishing - good - higher cut. 

* Self-publishing - good - parallelization - "You have to go in really looking at what quality you want. I pulled a little trick where I hired three different copy editors to go through the book the second time. As long as they kept catching things, I just kept putting it through until I was sure that it was clean and well done." 

* Self-publishing - Good - development editor role - "Cathy Yardley". " The development editor is the person who does so much for you. I work with Cathy Yardley and I wouldn’t write a book without her. She sets deadlines for me, she talks me off the cliff, she reads my writing and tells me when I’m not making any sense or when I’m pulling my punches and not creating enough drama." - https://www.rockyourwriting.com/about-contact/

* Self-publishing - Good - MVP - "Different books need different things. When I did Radical Focus, I actually created an MVP. I wrote a very short version of it, got it quickly edited, made a hundred copies and sold them at SXSW and over Twitter. I treated Radical Focus like a product."
