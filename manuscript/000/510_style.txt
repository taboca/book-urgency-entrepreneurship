A real deepr connection with the book thesis is that life urgencies gets in the way of a startup, not only to limit time that is being used but influencing the conversations, the discussions, the language. As an example, the language of war, or an action-oriented language, or clichÃªs; are used in the daily basis to solve the operations of business work, the work life. In other words, work life is connected with life life and with family life.
