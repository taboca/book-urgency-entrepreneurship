* outline - introduction, pitch - Slow down sounds complex but speed up sounds good, generally, of course.
--> 



When an incidental voice says "let's slow down," in a modern-world workplace, it doesn't sound great. If the team if pauses, they might wonder "why is it that we can't keep doing what we were doing?" On the other hand, the "let's speed up," sounds more plausible, although modern-world variations of "keep cranking" are not noisy and given by the smooth beat of digitalized thumbs ups and claps by the hour. And that makes sense, doesn't it? That is how we keep the beat, how we sum our efforts, especially in the corporate situation of the coherent movement, when things are working. That goes with closing the gap, getting things done earlier, selling more, delivering faster, all things that in a way or another follows the wider rithm of the competition, more or less eloquently. 

The complication, on the other hand, and in the entrepreneurial domain, happens to be that the thoughts of slowing down generally are seen as frustrating too, in the small setting of an early team or the head of one that is caught as a new founder, or as a founder again or too in a position of leadership of a major boat passing through the need to change. In other words, it does not matter, this happens - when we are caught openning the gap, not getting things done sooner, selling less, delivering slower, and the like. It's an unconfortable feeling. Now we do know that founders and innovators are resilient, that they are aware that of the world of uncertainty, that they need to be prepared to what does not look productive initially and later again and again through the growth path. And we know too that to many of us the fear of failure, or fear of the unproductive, is a force, that can move mountains. 

Yet, there is something there to be considered for many reasons - when one grabs anything that works, when a startup pivots prematurely to do something totally different, when a leader CEO does not commit to the new and sticks with what works, or the one that gives up, the startup team that loses faight, the CEO that accepts to be fired than to start again and be seen as a baby. Into that, we may wonder if we are teased by a system of self management which might me mirrored by the outter system of getting things done, one which favors and welcomes productivity, as in as soon as possible. I am concerned that, in part, our feeling of sadness that sets in when some unproductive condition chimes in - which is generally the case in the startup situation or any creative journey - sets in too because of the attention and focus we give to the other part of the equation, when we accept things that may look like greatness. I am concerned of the possibility of a bargain that we make, when we take. And how much we take it. And moreover, of the cost we pay for taking it, such as the cost of not being energetic again, not having energy. Moreover, and given that the movemnt to A requires eventual Fs, the sad reality that we keep on living generally inclined to accept changes but only so after a clear failure, after the proof in restrospect. That model may work to some extent but we shall wonder if that model pulls the best of us and if that model does not hurt more.

* outline - introduction, situation - of fun to work, hetic, "perks" support a fast-paced culture.  
--> 

But we can't blame our corporate world as the producers of that specialist spirit preventing us from embracing the generalist mindset. In fact it's all around, from our educated world as we know it, from work, from our families, and inside of us. Deep inside, we know it, the size of that monumental investment we took before we did that great walking far from the leg of our mother. We know how it felt great, to walk. We know, that it takes such a big effort to fight against that will, the will to stick, if you will, the will to sum, the will to conquer by doing what we know by how we know, and to rinse and repeat. 

Now and different from parents there is something to be considered from the corporate world. They made it fun to do it. Because "it's fun to work," isn't it? Maybe not in all work offices but we can imagine one that looks like an amuzement park. This one is modern and there is a bridge being built made of soda cans. Their workers can digitally scan each can they drink and instantly the team bridge grows in the digital office space. In this culture, they have beasts to be defeated, not problems to be solved. 

Now in this fun to work space to bring a complication requires skill. Try to cry for a breath, you will get an "eyes of tiger!" Try to spark distress and you earn a 'whiner' flair on your jacket. But a flair not too big, not too offensive, quite colored and fun; enough to silence that whinning call but not enough to lose the warrior. In other words, when the crew speaks that too many man and too many people are making too many problems, a critical manager is right there, pronto, and offers a helping hand that pours just enough rain on the parade but not enough to cloud the horizon and the rainbow. This is how equilibrium is maintained - keep serving the spirits - and ensure that flow is incessant. In other words, if you can't do it in the right way, in the fun way, don't do it, let it go. 

Now it is even funny that the pro and corporate world can even make it sound nice even when shit hits the fan, when the situaton would get to the "folks, we didn't do well," the pro world too brings the spirits back and planes back on track. As long as there is life in this park, the adventure won't stop. A sign in the lobby reads "When Dinousaurs Ruled the Earth," reaffirms they are okay in the middle of that colorful and chaotic world of beasts and not so broken broken things being improved. And if anyone insists in taking things too seriously - looking around or suspecting that the whole park is a mess - the actual hallways are there too to remind them, to bring back the colorfulness and the soft drink dispensers and premium quality ice cream which is a reminder that all of that is supported by the monumental investment of a charismatic investor who spared no expenses. They will protect us to keep the park running. Our motto says that "it's fun to work". Here we do not take life so serious anyway. 

But it may be too that the corporate world didn't invent this fun to work thing. Perhaps they added more toppings, but didn't come up with. Maybe that thing goes back to the our educated world after that early walk. The one which took us to do things the right way. 

This is, again, a problem for founders, especially because of having that big requirement, of being right, and then, or being required to be fun. 



Now there is another problem from the corporate park that in the startup situation too is critical. It is that when shit really really hits the fan, and when course-correction can't be taken and spirits can't go back, then park treats their roles like resources, like coal, think of them as expendable, and they are fired. Of course, HR chimes in to not touch their real identities as humans. They will be protected for the other journey. But it is through that medium of "we can't waste time," that people take themselves to enter the binary situation, in or out, sooner or later. But not in the surface, unfortunatelly, as it is perceived and promoted as an express - a highly performant train that incessantly arrives at the next station, no matter how turbulent was the ride. It can be difficult to stop our brains to read the underlying nature of this fast-moving train; because we happened to be dropped from the air after an "if you chose to accept this mission". And indeed, when the train seems to rest in a station, its crew quickly enters the celebration mode as opposed to get into the boring, reflective, never-ending, frustrating, and painful analysis of a post-mortem nature. On the contrary, the resting at the stations coherently speaks that "if we've exerted so much energy, and given that some of us have been lost along the way, let's just go ahead and have a moment of silence, let's just go ahead and respect our efforts, our soldiers, our resources." That call is enough to take our attention away from the reflection, and any spark for a revolution. Now it is the time for our moods to be energized, again, so the people joins with the lambs and sloths and carps and anchovies and orangutans, and breakast cereal, and fruits and bats, and of course the guacamole plus all of that goes well with the option to return home a couple hours early. Moreover, if everyone suddenly are the heroes of such an effort, it is then plausibly required a promotion which happens to go for the ones who stood for them, the ones that did the magic to supress any revolt, the ones that kept pouring the spirits high, the ones that kept the momentum going, that the fire burning.

--> 

But in perspective, if any of that language of action exists, it might do so as a result of an passive-aggressive work environment that favors a situation that leans heavily on extracting effort from humans. Althought guacamole could be evidently present [^footnote_guacamole_traning] in some of the best working places, it is arguably unfair to celebrate the exagerations given by these illustrations such as the implied idea that an action-oriented style of management, as opposed to real management, is the main beast we should fear. But the truth that I am after - throughout my attempt to turn what appears to be fun into bitterness - lies in considering the dangers of our inclination, as humans, to when we turn to become entrepreneurs and grab the wheel. When we operate the early stage with the same kinds of movements of the accelerated or productive world as we know it, as in to pursue the end no matter the means. Not a truth sought by the modern worker that operates  a mechanical equipment that put the life of their colleagues at risk, but in the sense of an entrepreneur that enters into entrepreneurship as if it is a car and suddently focuses on the road ahead, and feels that the equipment is there to accelerate into the destination, and by doing so denies to invest in developing consciousness for its behaviors, such as the management of entrepreneurship. 

[^footnote_guacamole_traning]: In the 2018 ASU GSV Summit during the Main Stage Panel titled "The Future of Talent -- Transcending Work," Rob Biederman, Co-Founder and CEO of Catalant Technologies, highlighted an intriguing aspect of corporate spending priorities. He pointed out that a large company which likely the audience were shareholders, allocates less budget per employee on training than his own startup spends on avocados. This remark emphasizes the disparity in investment priorities, particularly in training and education, compared to seemingly trivial expenses like avocados (Global Silicon Valley, 2018) expect that it may not be trivial in the sense of keeping the train moving as it is.

Therefore, I rather pull the hand brake and invite us to take another turn, and to consider that our need for speed drives us into a land of confusion that harms work in general, that harms us as entrepreneurs, that harms us as human beings, therefore the development of humanity.

To put in perspective, in the light of our strategy throught the book, the recognition of that language of action - particularly illustrated in the corporate sphere - is a starting point so that we can consider who we are, or who we are likely to become, when we are willing to thrive, to achieve, to beat the competition, to win, to survive, you name it. As an example, consider that our propensity to drive by key results, such as seeking key results connected with outcomes, rises from the individual which makes it synergentically projected in the collaborative situations of work. In the same perspective, it isn't a higher-order force, such as the above layers of management of a given organization, that brought us to where we are, such as to when we behave as urgent beings. In fact, we brought ourselves there as our success made a new world that we are into - the world of abundance of tools, resources, information, and the hyper-fast potential of a network.

And this situation, which is undeniably good, actually sets a challenge ahead of entrepreneurs, such as if you consider that an arbitrary entrepreneur might not see an inferno ahead, a so clear reason to free the world, and more importantly to the context of our book, so clear reason to execute entrepreneurship differently. In other words, if we are running along, or rolling, in the pace of the corporate sphere, anb in the pace of the urgent and networked world, we may have no reasons to break through, to think through, to break the norm, to break the speed, to break automatic responses, and so on. And this becomes a major complication for us, entrepreneurs or anyone that cares about them, and anyone who cares about humanity, because the environment of our success gives the means, such as an inclusive, or easy, or cheap, or acessible, of supporting an arbitraty entrepreneur such as one in a hurry, to just jump into actions, as if they had a "Jump to Conclusions Mat" where they can jump to.

Where we are going we don't need roads? 

Thus the focus area in our book comes down to reflecting on this accelerated pace that entrepreneurs might fit and how it impacts everything precisely at in the moment that we need energy, like willpower, and good ideas, and the right conditions to move on and achieve growth as individuals and for our organizations. What stands before us is the prioritization of the startup foundation, in the opposed direction where the end justifies the means. As we delve into the slowing down the fast-paced situation of entrepreneurship, we also touch on the age-old problem of navigation, the map of the story, the how to walk the story, more than a problem of speed. Andy Grove, in the book "High Output Management," reminds us of an old saying that if you don't know where you're going, any path will take you there [^editornote_andy_anyroad]. 

[^editornote_andy_anyroad]: This saying, according to Andy Grove, is an indian saying. Others say it's from elsewhere. But if Andy brought to his book, it is a saying necessary to acknowledge; just like Peter Drucker, as cited in the foreword, has reminded us that the balance between activities is connected to the organization of organization. 

Beyond what seems to be a narrative pushing for accelerated effort, the fast-paced mode of execution has also infiltrated the context of management analysis and planning. Things have not sped up simply because people are running more, working more intensively, or because managers coordinate the frantic pace because they enjoy it. The fast mode is supported by functions, or resources, that are “ready” and available at hand.

--> 


In the modern reality of the knowledge worker, data have come to be used as tools, as mechanisms to accelerate decisions. The former CEO of Intel, Andy Grove, in "Arguing with Data," warned [^grovefastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people should argue their debates with data already in hand (GROVEDATA, p.116).

--> 

[^grovefastdata]: In Andy Grove's book, "Only the Paranoid Survive," the quoted phrase in English reads, “Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It’s good advice. All too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis.” The warning applies to what he termed a "Strategic Inflection Point," situations so adverse and unexpected that they befuddle companies. Intel survived crises of this magnitude and later also became a leading player. In these situations, the anticipatory data can be misleading.

* Improving abstraction level - We are trying to follow an advice from William Zinsser, we then contextualize a higher abstraction thought, giving value to the specifics above. 
--> 

In Technology, Management, and Society, Peter Drucker has contextualized that the situation of information abundance does impact effective communications which was stressed as the kind of communication where the receiver effectively understand and collaborates, as opposed to passively accept the message: 

> *"More and better information does not solve the communication problem, nor does it bridge the communication gap. On the contrary, the more information the greater is the need for functioning and effective communication becomes. The more information available, in other words, the greater is the communications gap likely to be. The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and application, that is, on communications. In the second place, the more effective the information process, the more impersonal and formal will it become, the more will it separate human beings and thereby require separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the human relationships, the relationship of communication. It may be said that the effectiveness of the information process will depend increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of effective communication - that is, in the present situation - the information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can produce is data."*
> (Drucker, 2011, p. 15)

This form of operating decisions — with data — provokes us to reflect upon what can apparently look like a mechanization of cognition, which runs together with the the pressure of greater efficiency at work. The presence of data becomes concrete, providing people with "good data" which supports good reasons when faced with a decision that needs to be made. Data captivate us, certainly, because they work so well, when they do work.













<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - introduction, answer 2 - All is interactive and iterative, systems, networks, platforms.  
--> 

In the interconnected and turbulent world, experts are constantly under pressure to provide "faster" and more modern solutions for things they are already familiar with. Why send individual emails when you can send a million at once? It seems as though all available solutions appear useful and efficient. Additionally, in this chaotic environment, when you seek assistance, it’s not hard to find a multitude of resources available that, in one way or another, say "yes, I can help." These resources are experts in their fields, ready to execute what they know, showcasing their expertise. A programmer who codes faster, an engineer who calculates more quickly. The tools are more automated, and they deal with more data, or live data, and are readily available, and it leads to one click decision-making. Amidst this immediate availability of models, it’s easy to get swept up in the current—let’s face it—and choose solutions that promise quicker delivery among the options, without reconsidering the strategy of the process itself.

Being an action in the language, the availability of data, and tools that are now connected with data, an inertial force conveniently asks us to continue on that highly performant execution path - precisely because the external reference point, for navigation, is ignored. In this world, where speed can accelerate any specialty, we are led to believe that we can move even faster, even if we make mistakes or take a detour. Failing faster and learning is a theme that makes sense. 

However, reflection is necessary and important, as getting to the wrong place faster not only means delay but also implies the consumption of energy, resources, willpower, and motivation. Therefore, it can't be said that entrepreneurs will promptly jump into the action, the data, and the tools that support flow decisions; exactly because anyone willing to engage in entrepreneurship is now equipped with stories, methods, and systems that are made for entrepreneurs. Therefore, there is an ecosystem of entrepreneurship available which does cover the theme specialists vs. generalist. This goes back to Drucker's thought about the excess of information, it only requires more from us. And the solution gone haywire which generally chimes in - likely one to tell you what to go, a plug and play something, a framework for that too.

* outline - introduction, answer 3 - Comes decision making, lean induction, generalist-specialist [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 

The renowned Steve Blank has acknowledged and addressed a fundamental issue with startups when he revealed a vision he had in 2014. According to Steve, the precursor idea of the lean movement is that entrepreneurs think their ideas can be materialized as smaller versions of large companies. Steve states that "startups are not smaller versions of large companies," emphasizing the difference between a startup and an established company. He notes that a startup is in the discovery phase, which differs from a large company that has already identified its role in the market and has a validated product. When ideas are not validated, operating as if it were a large company is dangerous and risky since the young company is in the process of discovery and has limited resources for betting. 

By now, much about this subject (not operating as a large company and recognizing the discovery phase) exists in startup literature and is also present in the world of platforms, methodologies, and startup structures. But now a decade later us running with the lean startup movement, and the whole entrepreneurial ecosystem, grew in size so there is literally a sea of solutions to be used by entrepreneurs, that puts them in a position to be harassed by specialized solutions - likely driven by a specialized mindset. We are not being called to embrace being specialized generalists. All of this sets us in a high-performance cockpit of startup development where it seems applicable to run on a great high-speed road of innovation. It is all one-click to do, it is all "plug-and-play". It's beautiful.

The key problem is that these are now connected, and lean leads to decision making. They are now essentially subject to being trapped by using lean, claiming to use lean, which is essentially in a business of closing the wrong gap. They enter closing the gap of validation, so they bring equilibrium for advancing as specialists. 

Frameworks, platforms, and all sorts and supporting systems - accelerators, incubators, networking and funding platforms, are all part of the richer landscape which also sets them to pass by valid data. When a team decides to join, in the pressure to advance, a bootcamp, enroll in an incubator, dive into an accelerator, participate in a contest, and other participations with collaboration that promisses potential results that would perhaps sling them into even faster growth. These are situations that promise acceleration and claim to solve the entrepreneur's journey. 













<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - introduction, Complication, answer - Generalist decision-making gone haywire 
--> 

Can we blame abudance of options? No one is being forced, we know. So we can't blame abundance plus too that all good exciting new things are being done by the building blocks given, in a way or another. Still, the reality is that in the rush to act by these productive instincts, they scramble to seek solutions that they think are things that startups do. Similarly, entrepreneurs might, in their urgent processes, flee as followers of a mechanized and known corporate behavior - or a general cultural that grow ups do. It's not even a thin line to miss the point about misusing lean methods, it's generally a straight line to be thirsty for validation (about anything), to be immersed in lean processes at the risk of being enamored with the processes, which can be observation by the self promotion and self satisfaction of being advancing by practicing lean while their actions may be about actually procrastinating using lean.

When we are hungry for the breakfast and in front of the all-you-can-it buffet, with solutions for everything for all the phases of growth, the crew feels empowered to pick more. And worse of all, taken from the beauty of all, entrepreneurship rises from a hungry spirit, on one hand, and on the other entrepreneurship demands the crew to accept that digestion problems are part of the course. Thus, entrepreneurship calls for growth and growth supports call to action, such as to eat more and to shop more.

* outline - introduction - Answer - book's intention 
--> 

This book is about courage, permission, and self-respect. It takes courage, and a leap of faith, to innovate the perspecive of what means management for innovation. It takes courage to see productivity as procrastination. It takes permission to see through new goggles, to believe that something really great can be found by not being a controller. And self-respect because entrepreneurship recognizes the doer that is not a know-it-all, recognizes that the real A comes from Fs and not from Bs. It's not necessarily about joining the club because the beat seems to be the "beat of the moment." The greatest abuse an entrepreneur can commit is when they start to sacrifice who they are and see them through the eyes of the system - to shape a professional identity. From that they fail to comply with their own values, with the well-being, and with their ability to discover what they are essentially doing. It takes them to confusion, or into a fusion, and from that to produce far too many outcomes to their selves, to their colleagues, to the future of their corporations. It costs them. 

By establishing the path of conscious entrepreneurship, we will give strenght and support a healthier entrepreneurial body against toxic developments, against an auto-immune reaction. In this urgent, fast-paced, and turbulent world, the entrepreneur needs to act but does so under a stressful condition that is engaged as in it is the way to perform, to thrive, to beat a competition. However, these actions should not arise from arbitrary pressures that lead entrepreneurs to ignore the strategic issues of work conduct. 

In other words, we aim a strategy that ceases to be reactive or speed-oriented from the pressures clamoring for results. Thus we will set themselves to avoid resorting to abuses that form a toxic culture centered where the end justifies the means. In such a culture, work dances with the bursts of motivational incentives, while possible signs of an environment detrimental to the work itself and the development of the team's work methodology are silenced. The strategy cannot be reduced to just going with the flow, by following the shadows of the world’s accelerated pace. We don’t just want speed, to run for the sake of running. On the contrary, execution and effort is meant to set us to be learners again, to start again, to renew our views, to gain perspective. Thus, we are into a mission for leaning about growth, as individuals and as leaders of our organizations. By doing so, we create a learning organization, which is one of the goals of this reflection and opportunity.

Therefore, we bring situations, complications, and reflections that were not designed as recipes, as ready-made solutions to solve the adversities and complexities of the urgent mode. The idea is to strengthen, or to recover, or to keep alive, the entrepreneurial side of the entrepreneur — so that when you are confronted with chaos, and pressure, and a "normal" crazyness at work which is incessantly urgent and rarely seen as toxic and that is actually presented as a price to pay, or the norm, for success. In this sense, Fried and Hansson [^basecampcrazy] invite us to reflect:

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried and Hansson are the founders of Basecamp, a well-known company from Silicon Valley focused on productivity. In the book "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," they argue that it is necessary to work against the industry's toxic instincts and norms that avoids the possibility of managing a company calmly. The expression "It's crazy at work" is used by them to describe a work environment where pressure, such as excessive working hours, and consequences like anxiety, are the norm; and they reject this idea in favor of a calmer and more balanced work environment.

> *"Infelizmente, administrar uma empresa de maneira tranquila não é o modo padrão de gerir uma empresa atualmente. Você precisa ir contra seus instintos por um tempo. Você precisa deixar de lado as normas tóxicas da indústria. Você precisa reconhecer que 'É loucura no trabalho' não está certo."* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 9, tradução nossa).

In this sense, this material is not made for a machine. Our most essential reference is valuing the human being as the foundation of the entrepreneurial spirit. In other words, our strategy does not involve selling out the human being as part of the process, discarding our greatest resource. This idea necessarily creates a force, or principle, of self-respect. It sets boundaries for the well-being for the entrepreneur which I regard as the highest investment and the actual only real way to navigate through the startup environment and into growth. This will be our guiding principle for many of the reflections through the three parts to come.

In part one, through *Urgency of the Self*, to support our conscious attitude for the road ahead, the road of growth of the startup which we assume that can only be achieved by self growth under the tenet that we are not expendable, that we value our beings and that who we are as entrepreneurs matches who we are as human beings - that everyone is an entrepreneur and that the role developed by entrepreneurship is not an indentity that is used for a business which is separated from us as a whole. We look at who we are, we value who we are, so that we can respect ourselves through the navigation that may set us into traps, into a disconnect. Through this part we go from key elements of who we are and straightly reflecting about our situation in the middle of the environment, through the inclination for running, through the journey of impact. Above all, we check on ourselves rather than to look for the external. Although the startup journey can't be controlled, our invest relies in observations and reflections about us doing it in ways that are less frustrating, less confusing, less arbitrary, and more fruitful, minimally in terms of the being conscious about our best selves which is key for the road ahead.

Through the second part, *Urgency of the Team*, we extent our reflections to improve the health of the team dynamics as it improve its collaboration. We start by considering how the urgent rises from execution and the challenging space this creates for keep the conscious view of purpose, such as how we start to fail with our entrepreneurial characterizations and entrepreneurship well-being causing the entrepreneurial function to lag behind, or be obfuscated by the movement of progress. We give special consideration for the dynamics that are given by applicability of lean movements and how teams generally think they are advancing but actually building up a great level of disconnection from their purpose. We wrap this part by valuing communication not as a communication serving the purpose of goals, like a tool, but a view for communication that serves for the growing the team in the first place.

We complete the book through *Urgency in the system*, considering general elements that affects teams organization-wide ways. We recognize that the growth up and productive state of an organization demands a goal system that needs to be efficient. To that, we ask of our goal management efforts to being flexible, to be conscious, to be honest. As a final reflection, we will consider the beautiful and powerful world of narratives that involves celebrating how we get to do amazing things quick - such as to pull effort from humans - but too why to never do it without being conscious and aware of the dynamics of how our narrative systems influences control in ways we are not aware - given by voices through platforms, networks, systems, tools, technologies - by its own inherantly powerful characterizations if we assume ourselves as Homom narrans. 










This is a book for everyone who supports entrepreneurs, but particularly for those who care about them and are concerned with their health and their psychological well-being; hence for those who do not think that entrepreneurs are expendable. They are the ones in the arena, and it is a complicated space, full of urgencies and a fast-paced nature, which could prompt them into action and a natural inclination to miss the space for evaluating themselves. Thus, it becomes a book for entrepreneurs themselves as naturally, they will likely be alone at times, and will bear the responsibility to grow themselves, to learn and adapt from experiences. Being open, and involved, into an enlightenment should be acknowledged as part of entrepreneurship. This is especially necessary as entrepreneurs are expected to be in a position to change reality, to free themselves from the normal way things are done, which requires adapting and changing themselves. Entrepreneurial action invites new management.
