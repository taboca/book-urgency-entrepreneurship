* Abstract - introduction - The need to break the "ongoing conversation" of the corporate world as a train that affects how we work, and also has mechanized the entrepreneurial behavior. Situation is that if try to stop the train, is bad or slow, as opposed to urgent and fast. Complication is that urgent models defines our behaviors. Let's introduce abundance of current platform - with data, and tools and systems - supports mechanized cognition. With limited attention span as culturally accepted (foreword has covered this). With growth systems which enlarges risks. Reasons for moving forward is awareness, conscious entrepreneurship. Part 1,2,3. 
 
### Review SCqA 

* Subject - There is an "ongoing conversation" and an "ongoing train" in the corporate world - one that is fast, urgent, frenetic, or fast paced. Even for entrepreneurs, which are generally required to be generalists, they find themselves onto certain tracks when engage to execute their startups. These tracks show on their ways, like train tracks, calls for urgent and fast paced approach to entrepreneurship; which can prevent them to see how to be effective managers of their entrepreneurial effort.  

* Situation - Culture intro - Entrepreneurs falls in traps as they navigate the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, or the fast-paced culture of entrepreneurship. Ongoing conversation is real. Narratives are real. Such as failing. Well, falling is not even perceived as trap but as part of the equation, to fail and learn, or to learn fast. So, right there, after a fail, no time to reflect. But the situation is that the generalist mindset can run as a mechanized approach to entrepreneurship in the face of the urgent, frenetic, fast-paced, world of entrepreneurship; where being faster is coherent and goes well with good reasons to move fast, such as access to knowlege, role models, stories, methodologies, data, and support systems such as investors and other systems for scaling. 

* Complication - The complication is that a lot of models exist to help, like lean methologies which are strong, but it is undeniable that in the fast-paced setting, or when attention span is limited, and pressure for growth is present, entrepreneurs might be trapped - not by the tools but - by themselves, as they fail to reflect, to judge, to see from above, to shock-absorb their behaviors, to revisit and review how they are managers of entrepreneurship. 

* Key line - Shall we dig more into the parts or briefly make an invitation to the parts and use the key lines as the elements of how we experience things?

* Support - As individuals, we are compelled into specialist mode for all areas, including entrepreneurship. We deny the integrality of us. Part 1. 

* Support - We face the pressure also from peers, as we move into tribes. We have pressure as systems and supporting growth models too. We deny respecting peers. 

* Support - We have mechanized decision with data, tools, and systems. Thinking that they are moving into the next stage. Example, as in foreword we had "shop for solutions", Michael points "out the shelf" actions like "Hiring people" check blitzscaling talk. There is no way, time, to keep management open, to think how they are doing, as urgency drives them to deliver, to focus in what. Breaks them from breaking the norm of excitement which breaks them to unfold the "moving across" of Michael. 

* Structure of book.

When someone says "let's go slow", it usually doesn't sound good, especially in the workplace where people collaborate. It sounds like a warning of "danger ahead." Or it might come across as if chastising for something done wrong, a misguided direction. Furthermore, it conveys the idea of underperformance. On the other hand, "let's speed up!" is well-received and has a positive bias. It's easier to hear and accept ideas such as "close the gap," "get there earlier," "sell more," and "deliver faster."

This has become the norm. So normal, in fact, that we no longer notice situations where more speed, more effort, leads us down a slower path. The office space in fact does a service in that direction, as a workplace for "let's speed up" where any potential negative outcome is mutated into a challenging beast. In the hustle of how things happens and before anyone points out problems in the park, another scream of "let's speed up folks" chimes in. This next one does the service of accelerating the what went slow - as opposed to what went wrong - thus forcing justice through the goggles that the effort wasn't enough. It normally comes like "Folks, we didn't do well. Or, well enough. Well, we did great. We can do more." Then when more mistakes gets closer to the fan the spirits are lifted with a "now is the time" that mobilizes the team to action while a manager-of-chaos theorist says that "life finds a way." In this lobby a banner falls from the ceiling that reads "When Barbarians Ruled the Earth." It is a reminder for them that they aren't barbarians, even when things are a bit chaotic. It gives them the human touch that justifies that the park out of control is just part of the success equation - it's fight for results which is worth it. Additionally, as long as there are cokes and free ice cream available in the park, and a generous and charismatic investor who spared no expense, things will be fine. 

In other words, taking a moment to reflect can be ackward, not to say a crime, if anyone even had the time to think about that idea. And so we ignore noticing that we are trapped in a fast train, in a rhythmic "push-go, push-hustle, push-drive, push-go!" a coordinated in-loco motive that calls to action, to more fuel, more fire, because up ahead there is a promise of a better station, better state, a chance to celebrate the effort, and even honor the losses on the way, and a promise of distribution of gains. 

The complication is that a lot of models exist to help, like the lean methologies [^footnote_lean_intro] which are real and true, but it is undeniable that in the fast-paced setting, and when attention span is limited and pressure for growth is unlimited, entrepreneurs can be trapped not by the tools - or methods or the collective abundance of solutions - but by themselves, as they fail to reflect, to judge, to see from above, to shock-absorb their behaviors, to revisit and review how they are doing as managers of their entrepreneurial effort. 

[^footnote_lean_intro]: 

This brings us to my concern: what appears to be a productive environment actually serves to diminish our respect for the constituents in general, starting with the founder's team, of course starting with founders. This approach can train us into the habit of misusing resources in the name of achieving outcomes, and at the same time we lose touch with important reflections related to focus, distractions, arbitrary decisions, risky gambles, managing risks, and practicing conscious entrepreneurship.

#### Expendable resources

Anyone crying out for breathing likely gets an "Eyes of tiger!," which does more of a service as a call to effort than real action. And anyone that speaks out a hint of distress earn themselves a 'whiner' flair on their jacket. Not too big, not too offensive, and quite colored or fun, but enough to silence the whinning call but not enough to lose the soldier. And if, as a whole, the crew speaks of stopping the movement, similarly the critic disguised as managemer chimes in to offer a helping hand, pouring enough rain on the parade but not enough to cloud the horizon and hide the rainbow. In other words, the corporate setting carries the duty to maintain the equilibrium, to keep serving the spirits high, and to ensure that the flow is incessant. If we zoom out from what into how things happens, it's a language borne of a passive-aggressive culture, favoring managers or actually non-managing managers, who lean heavily on extracting from human resources. On this train, however, the human resource essentially becomes the coal. Expenditure is now the manager  coordinates its duty - it is through a narrative of "we can't waste time" or "waste is not an option" that the corporate setting becomes wasteful. And so, in this perceived "highly performant" modern management, after unaccounted losses, that the train approaches the next station, no matter how turbulent was the ride, finds a station that welcomes everyone as heroes, even before a hand it raised. If it is, gets a colored popsicle. It is time for a celebration, takes the moment for any reflective thought, that honors. So they think, "if we've exerted so much energy and burned our resources in the so many attempts, if some of us have been lost along the way, let's then have a moment of silence - we respect our soldiers. Then let's follow by a few hearty hours of celebration. It's the people's feast that takes place, with lambs and sloths and carps and anchovies and orangutans and breakast cereals and fruit and bats and needless to say guacamole and the option to return home a couple hours early. For those who orchestrated the show, up to the station, a promotion is in order, for a couple leaders representing a team of soldiers; comes swiftly as a cost-effective approach to elevate the real heroes, the subordinates. Not only cost effective but it prevents a revolt and at the same time lifts the spirits to keep moving. The train can't lost its momentum, it's fire, them fuel. This situation sadly meshes with the narratives of modern corporate management. Especially when the organization validates the strategy as sound and coherent, then the fast-paced mode goes well as a supporting system for increased efficiency. Althought some organizations are closer or far from this unsweet spot, it is not an incoherent possibility as some of that shows a degree of ethical hue. It's moral, since it ties with a human value that effort makes change. 

In perspectve, we promote a highly productive space on the one hand, and on the other a system that forgets the being, as if you can pick from so many options of solutions that you may ignore the fact that you are focusing on the art of picking, the art of selecting from choices, too many choices. It is not easy to see it as a space where we can be lost among choices, lost among stories, with data, and worse, capable and able to come up with a good narrative that justifies moving on. But this space can be misleading in its nature as if there were a social algorithm that incessantly teases to focus on targetting outcomes and shopping for solutions, as opposed to reflecting and revisiting our core structure for how things are done. And what would be that structure? The being, human beings, especially when we are in a small boat. Thus, the environment might offer a space for ourselves to mislead ourselves as we account us as good decision makers, as we confuse speed of making decisions with making good decisions, as we can't see that a life of picking from a basket of cheap solutions actually in fact is training ourselves as expendable beings. In other words, the fast-paced situation in the modern context of entrepreneurship treats entrepreneurs like expendable front-line soldiers dragged into action. In this entrepreneurial ecosystem, not to say jungle, the navigation in the urgent way prompts entrepreneurs into the situation where the ends justifies the means, an outcome-driven nature. By ignoring ourselves, our willpower, our energy, we get used to the business of ignoring the vital force in the people around us. We will give them words, again, like "Eyes of the tiger", when we are obsessed with the ends whatever the means. In other words, the ecosystem sets us to ignore the management of entrepreneurship, right from the start, although the start is when it is most needed. 

The illustration above portrays a work pace that is both accelerated and frenetic, which has become the norm in the world of work, particularly in the corporate sphere. Has this become the standard because people are simply eager to finish the plan they've started? Is it due to a fear of losing what seems to be working, or what has already been invested, and facing the inherent risk of what is new and demands planning? Or, perhaps, is it because employees are, above all, measured by efficiency and result metrics tied to the present? Alternatively, maybe the acceleration and pursuit of efficiency stem from the natural pressure of a competitive work process that is inherently based on comparisons. In this competitive environment, performance becomes an impactful factor as we desire to move faster, and deliver quicker, than others.

Thus the focus area in our book comes down to reflecting on this accelerated pace that entrepreneurs might fit and how it impacts everything precisely at in the moment that we need energy, like willpower, and good ideas, and the right conditions to move on and achieve growth as individuals and for our organizations. What stands before us is the prioritization of the startup foundation, not a focus given to the pursuit of a valuable solution for a potential customer, in the direction that the end justifies the means. As we delve into the slowing down the fast-paced situation of entrepreneurship, we also touch on the age-old problem of navigation, the map of the story, the how to walk the story, more than a problem of speed. Andy Grove, in the book "High Output Management," reminds us of an old saying that if you don't know where you're going, any path will take you there [^editornote_andy_anyroad]. 

[^editornote_andy_anyroad]: This saying, according to Andy Grove, is an indian saying. Others say it's from elsewhere. But if Andy brought to his book, it is a saying necessary to acknowledge; just like Peter Drucker, as cited in the foreword, has reminded us that the balance between activities is connected to the organization of organization. 

#### Mechanization of decision   

Beyond what seems to be a narrative pushing for accelerated effort, the fast-paced mode of execution has also infiltrated the context of management analysis and planning. Things have not sped up simply because people are running more, working more intensively, or because managers coordinate the frantic pace because they enjoy it. The fast mode is supported by functions, or resources, that are “ready” and available at hand. In the American Wild West, a saw in the hand of a carpenter was a piece of work that deserved attention and care, finding the correct speed, finding the correct use. An apprentice considering the tool would find a mentor, perhaps in the form of a master, but there was an environment for learning. In the modern reality of the knowledge manager, data have come to be used as tools, as mechanisms to accelerate decisions. [There is an article by Peter Drucker that says technology is work. Perhaps it is a special foundation that justifies this almost aberration where data become tools. On one hand, an aberration, on the other, it is necessary to talk about it because this is being done in day-to-day operations.] The former CEO of Intel, Andy Grove, in "Arguing with Data," warned [^grovefastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people should argue their debates with data already in hand (GROVEDATA, p.116).

[^grovefastdata]: No livro de Andy, Only the Paranoid Survive (Apenas o Paranoico Sobrevive), a frase citada em inglês é “A doutrina de gestão contemporânea sugere que você deve abordar qualquer debate e argumento com dados em mãos. É um bom conselho. Com demasiada frequência, as pessoas substituem opiniões por fatos e emoções por análise.” O alerta se aplica à situação que ele chamou de Ponto de Inflecção Estratégico, situações tão adversas e inesperadas que confundem as empresas. A Intel sobreviveu a situações de crise dessa magnitude e mais tarde também se tornou a protagonista. Nessas situações, os dados que antecipam podem ser enganosos. 

Essa forma de operar decisões - com dados - nos provoca para refletir sobre uma certa mecanização da cognição, que vai de encontro com a necessidade de maior eficiência no trabalho. A presença de dados torna-se concreta, nos dá boas razões, diante de uma decisão que precisa ser feita. Dados nos cativam, certamente, porque funcionam tão bem, quando funcionam. Como ferramentas, como uma serra.   

Por outro lado, quando ondas inesperadas aparecem e novos ventos sopram, como as situações adversas à frente das equipes, é quando precisamos de novas soluções já que o que está sendo feito precisa ser reconsiderado. Mas os momentos de incertezas não chegam com uma faixa - momento de incerteza, novos ventos à frente. Acabamos que caímos em armadilhas na sequência do executar.

O que acontece no mundo interconectado e turbulento é que os especialistas são constantemente pressionados por soluções "mais rápidas" e modernas para coisas que eles já conhecem. Por que enviar e-mails individuais quando você pode enviar um milhão de e-mails de uma só vez? É como se todas as soluções disponíveis parecessem úteis, eficientes. Além disso, neste oceano turbulento, quando você pede ajuda, não é difícil encontrar uma multidão de marinheiros, especialistas em suas áreas, prontos para executar o que sabem fazer - o lado do especialista. Um programador que codifica mais rápido, um engenheiro que calcula mais rápido. As ferramentas, mais automatizadas. E os dados, agora disponíveis mais cedo e prontos para ajudar na tomada de decisões. Em meio a essa disponibilidade imediata de modelos, é fácil entrar na onda - e vamos encarar - escolher soluções que prometem entregar mais rapidamente, entre as opções, sem reconsiderar a estratégia do processo em sí.  

Mas também é igualmente conveniente continuar no mesmo caminho, justamente porque o ponto de referência externo, de navegação, é ignorado. Neste mundo, onde a velocidade pode acelerar qualquer especialidade, somos levados a pensar que podemos acelerar ainda mais, mesmo que cometamos erros ou peguemos um desvio. Falhar mais rápido e aprender é um tema que faz sentido. No entanto, uma reflexão é necessária e importante, uma vez que chegar mais rápido ao lugar errado não significa apenas atraso, mas também implica o consumo de energia, recursos, força de vontade e motivação.

Nesse mar de soluções prontas, o empreendedor pode participar de um bootcamp, se inscrever em uma incubadora e depois mergulhar em um acelerador. Esses são situações que prometem acelerações e prometem resolver a jornada do empreendedor. O assédio para o modo "apenas faça" ataca também o perfil do empreendedor, que demanda o pensamento generalista, porém agora fica igualmente assediado por soluções especializadas. Em outras palavras, o empreendedor que deveria estar na posição generalista, torna-se puxado para o cockpit da inovação, que oferece opções "plug-and-play" do mundo urgente. 

#### Pressured frames at scale 

O renomado Steve Blank abordou a questão fundamental um o problema, no caso das startups, quando revelou uma visão (Blank, 2014) que teve. Segundo Steve, a ideia precursora do movimento *lean* é que os empreendedores pensam que suas ideias podem ser materializadas como versões pequenas de grandes empresas. Steve diz que "startups não são versões pequenas de grandes empresas", que a diferença entre uma startup e uma empresa estabelecida é que a startup está na fase de descoberta, o que é diferente da grande empresa que já identificou seu papel no mercado e tem um produto validado. Quando as ideias não estão validadas, operar como se fosse uma grande empresa é muito perigoso e arriscado, já que a empresa jovem está em processo de descoberta e tem poucos recursos para apostas. Muito sobre esse assunto (não operar como uma grande empresa e reconhecer a fase de descoberta) existe na literatura de startups e também está presente no mundo das plataformas, metodologias e estruturas de startups.

Mas de fato, essa ideia forte também leva empreendedores para correrem para um outro espaço, como empreendedores reativos por instintos, por exemplo quando eles correm para buscar as soluções que pensam que são coisas que startups fazem. Então, de forma similar, empreendedores podem também, em seus processos urgentes, fugir do comportamento corporativo e serem atraídos para o comportamento automático do modo que as startups fazem. Por exemplos, podem ficarem imersos nos processos lean, apaixonados pelos processos, promoverem que fazem lean enquanto estão procrastinando com lean[^editornote_procrastination_lean], e muito mais. 

[^editornote_procrastination_lean]: A further chapter shows the interview with Steve Blank where the talking about lean without doing lean appears as a potential phenomenon.

When we are hungry for the breakfast and in front of the all-you-can-it buffet, with solutions for everything for all the phases of growth, the crew can always pick more. And worse of all, taken from the beauty of all, entrepreneurship rises from a hungry spirit, on one hand, and on the other entrepreneurship demands the crew to accept that digestion problems are part of the course. Thus, entrepreneurship calls for growth and growth supports call to action, such as to eat more and to shop more. 

Eric Ries had also recognized a complication where founders start with lean but appear to drop lean as they get signs of traction, as in they fall into executing in a more traditional way, as soon as possible. A possibility for that behavior might not be only coming from the urge to succeed but also forces of the growth system that appears ahead of anyone willing to make a startup [^editornote_paulgraham_growth] - growth.

[^editornote_paulgraham_growth]: Paul Graham covers both the aspect that startups are for a growth situation but also covers that founders follow instincs such as a willingness to play the game. The through of sorrow of Paul Graham also depicts that startups force their status as political, projections, leading to falling in their own traps, such as to be sad that their projections were not real.

#### The next chapters, its parts 

Com o objetivo de correr menos para qualquer lugar e fazer apostas menores e ações mais conscientes, o empreendedor precisa de uma abordagem mais adequada para navegar nesse ambiente que, caso não tenha uma atitude consciente, se mostrará frustrante mas também exaustivo. Essa abordagem, acima de tudo, começa com algo que está dentro e menos fora, que demanda menos uma tendência moderna e compulsiva por, a todo momento, buscar a solução no externo. Neste sentido, este material não foi feito para uma máquina. Nossa referência mais essencial, um pilar maior, é assumirmos nosso ser humano como a base do nosso ser empreendedor. Em outras palavras, nossa estratégia não envolve vender, ou descartar, nosso ser humano durante o processo, descartar o maior recurso. 

Essa ideia necessariamente cria uma força, ou princípio, de autorespeito, no sentido de limites que geram saídas criativas. Isso será nosso guia para muitas das nossas reflexões nas três partes que virão. Veremos que com base em autorespeito ao ser empreendedor estaremos nos libertando no rumo de um empreendedorismo consciente que pode ser mais imune ao ruído e ambiente turbulanto e interconectado, o ambiente que é normalmente percebido como acelerado. 

Assim, este livro aborda questões empreendedoras de tal maneira que o empreendedor não se torne uma pessoa desviada do que acredita. Esse princípio começa com a permissão de negar ou desistir - não necessariamente embarcar no "trem-bala" apenas porque outros empreendedores o fazem. Não necessariamente entrar na boate porque a batida parece ser a "batida do momento". O maior abuso que o empreendedor pode cometer é quando começa a sacrificar sua identidade, ou confunde-se sua identidade diante do papel que está vivenciando no modo empreendedor.  

No mundo urgente, rápido e turbulento, o empreendedor precisa agir. Entretanto, essas ações não devem surgir com base em pressões sem estratégia, mas em uma estratégia personalizada que se desenvolve durante o processo. A estratégia não pode ser apenas a velocidade e as pressões que clamam por resultados. Isso é particularmente verdadeiro no ambiente de pessoas quando não encontramos ferramentas e somos obrigados a recorrer a abusos que, na verdade, formam uma cultura tóxica centrada em estímulos e foco no presente. Em tal cultura, os jorros de pressão e os gritos são mal interpretados como incentivo motivacional, em vez de sinais de um ambiente prejudicial.

A estratégia não pode se resumir a seguir o fluxo, à sombra do ritmo acelerado do mundo. Não queremos apenas velocidade, correr por correr. Pelo contrário, precisamos aprender enquanto realizamos, para que possamos crescer, tanto nós como os indivíduos que colaboram em nossas empresas. Com isso criamos uma organização de aprendizado, que é um dos objetivos dessa reflexão e oportunidade.

Aqui estão recursos e situações que não foram projetadas como receitas, como soluções prontas para resolver as adversidades. Eles representam uma oportunidade para reflexão. A ideia é fortalecer um lado do seu ser empreendedor, para que você possa enfrentar a pressão padrão - que traz dados que muitas vezes parecem sinais mas que muitas vezes são ruídos que perturbam o processo construtivo, à jornada empreendedora em questão.

Quando confrontados com o caos e a pressão, é comum não reconhecemos que estamos perpetuando um ciclo prejudicial. Na verdade, essa "loucura" no trabalho, urgência incessante, é raramente vista como tóxica. Ao invés disso, é apresentada como uma necessidade ou um preço a pagar pelo sucesso. Nesse sentido, Fried e Hansson [^basecampcrazy] nos convidam para uma reflexão:

> "Infelizmente, administrar uma empresa de maneira tranquila não é o modo padrão de gerir uma empresa atualmente. Você precisa ir contra seus instintos por um tempo. Você precisa deixar de lado as normas tóxicas da indústria. Você precisa reconhecer que 'É loucura no trabalho' não está certo." (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 9, tradução nossa).

Na busca de uma abordagem de empreendedorismo mais cosciente, ou honesta, nosso objetivo é permitir que o empreendedor se concentre em uma agenda mais produtiva e saudável; diante da jornada que é difícil e incerta. Com autorepeito e uma visão consciente, os passos do empreendedor se tornam mais produtivos, aumentando as chances para o sucesso, e criando um modo de pensar mais consciente que promove empreendimentos e organizações mais duradouras. 

A primeira parte, intitulada "Urgência Comportamental", trata da natureza do empreendedor, uma introspecção, pois é inútil discutir os perigos e armadilhas do mundo urgente sem analisar hábitos e comportamentos. Com isso, enriquecemos uma estrutura básica de princípios que nos guiará no mundo acelerado, contra armadilhas.

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried e Hansson são os fundadores da Basecamp, uma reconhecida empresa do Vale do Silício focada em produtividade. No livro "It doesn't have to be crazy at work", eles defendem que é preciso trabalhar contra os instintos e normas tóxicas da indústria para administrar uma empresa de forma tranquila. A expressão "É loucura no trabalho" é utilizada por eles para descrever um ambiente de trabalho onde a pressão, como excesso de horas de trabalho, e consequência como a ansiedade, são a norma; e rejeitam essa ideia em prol de um ambiente de trabalho mais calmo e equilibrado.

A segunda agenda, "Urgência Interpessoal", é uma oportunidade para refletirmos sobre nossa comunicação acelerada no ambiente onde as pessoas colaboram. Vamos olhar sobre como o modo de execução reativo e urgente cria uma pressão para um empreendorismo urgente onde ações se tornaram mais especializadas, com soluções prontas para tudo e onde estamos sempre engrenados, como a propensão para empreendedores executarem seus planos com suporte de plataformas interativas onde os protagonistas estão inscritos e participando de forma ativa. Nossa reflexão pede não que empreendedores deixem de navegar nesse mundo. Pede um pouco menos de precisão na execução e mais atenção sobre saber como se guiar. Isso será uma oportunidade de reflexão sobre o fato de que nem sempre a agenda do mundo, mesmo que seja super eficiente, é compatível com a agenda em construção do empreendedor e do seu empreendimento; consequentemente seus objetivos e sonhos.

A última parte é uma oportunidade de olhar o empreendedor que cresce sua organização que busca desenvolver uma entidade de trabalho sustentável mas nesse ambiente urgente. Nesta parte, a reflexão nos permitirá considerar como que a cultura também exerce controle, como ferramentas e tecnologias modernas exercem pressão e nos colocam na posição de subordinados sendo que nem mais sabemos que somos vitimas. Nossa reflexão pede um protagonismo iluminado para nossas organizações, que sugere abordagens para o empreendimento avançar, melhorando a velocidade por meio do desenvolvimento de uma cultura forte. O foco é dado para uma organização que quer curanr o processo, sua cultura e equipe de trabalho. Em nenhum momento o livro sugere que o empreendedor abandone seus princípios, que são a premissa básica do livro e estão enraizados na primeira agenda. Então, vamos lá, vamos lidar, em primeiro lugar, com o Urgência Comportamental.

#### Worth considering final remark? 

Na corrida de resistência do empreendedorismo, quando a névoa é densa, acelerar não é a melhor opção. Para aqueles que o fazem, quando "acelerar" é a estratégia, é melhor desejar-lhes boa sorte, porque uma coisa é garantida - eles entrarão em uma espiral que os levará mais rapidamente a um destino medíocre, consumindo, desgastando e potencialmente levando ao fim não swó da ideia mas do negócio. A busca pelo resultado sem a preocupação com a startup está diretamente ligada a capacidade de aprender que é necessária no processo de empreender. E quando execução sem consciência encontra resultados negativos, temos poucos cartuchos de energia para ativar o mesmo jogo, o que gera confusão, distração, frustração, o que desmotiva. Sim, se estiverem em modo de jogo, alguns deles podem até vencer com velocidade como estratégia. Mas a premissa desse livro não é essa, que acelerar é estratégia, ou que errar rápido e aprender rápido é a estratégia fundamental.
