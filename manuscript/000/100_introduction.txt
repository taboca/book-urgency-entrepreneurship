* Abstract - introduction - The need to break the "ongoing conversation" of the corporate world as a train that affects how we work, and also has mechanized the entrepreneurial behavior. Situation is that if try to stop the train, is bad or slow, as opposed to urgent and fast. Complication is that urgent models defines our behaviors. Let's introduce abundance of current platform - with data, and tools and systems - supports mechanized cognition. With limited attention span as culturally accepted (foreword has covered this). With growth systems which enlarges risks. Reasons for moving forward is awareness, conscious entrepreneurship. Part 1,2,3. 
 
### Review SCqA 

* Subject - There is an "ongoing conversation" and an "ongoing train" in the corporate world - one that is fast, urgent, frenetic, or fast paced. Even for entrepreneurs, which are generally required to be generalists, they find themselves onto certain tracks when engage to execute their startups. These tracks show on their ways, like train tracks, calls for urgent and fast paced approach to entrepreneurship; which can prevent them to see how to be effective managers of their entrepreneurial effort.  

* Situation - Culture intro - Entrepreneurs falls in traps as they navigate the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, or the fast-paced culture of entrepreneurship. Ongoing conversation is real. Narratives are real. Such as failing. Well, falling is not even perceived as trap but as part of the equation, to fail and learn, or to learn fast. So, right there, after a fail, no time to reflect. But the situation is that the generalist mindset can run as a mechanized approach to entrepreneurship in the face of the urgent, frenetic, fast-paced, world of entrepreneurship; where being faster is coherent and goes well with good reasons to move fast, such as access to knowlege, role models, stories, methodologies, data, and support systems such as investors and other systems for scaling. 

* Complication - The complication is that a lot of models exist to help, like lean methologies which are strong, but it is undeniable that in the fast-paced setting, or when attention span is limited, and pressure for growth is present, entrepreneurs might be trapped - not by the tools but - by themselves, as they fail to reflect, to judge, to see from above, to shock-absorb their behaviors, to revisit and review how they are managers of entrepreneurship. 

* Key line - Shall we dig more into the parts or briefly make an invitation to the parts and use the key lines as the elements of how we experience things?

* Support - As individuals, we are compelled into specialist mode for all areas, including entrepreneurship. We deny the integrality of us. Part 1. 

* Support - We face the pressure also from peers, as we move into tribes. We have pressure as systems and supporting growth models too. We deny respecting peers. 

* Support - We have mechanized decision with data, tools, and systems. Thinking that they are moving into the next stage. Example, as in foreword we had "shop for solutions", Michael points "out the shelf" actions like "Hiring people" check blitzscaling talk. There is no way, time, to keep management open, to think how they are doing, as urgency drives them to deliver, to focus in what. Breaks them from breaking the norm of excitement which breaks them to unfold the "moving across" of Michael. 

* Structure of book.

When someone says "let's go slow", it usually doesn't sound good, especially in the workplace where people collaborate. It sounds like a warning of "danger ahead." Or it might come across as if chastising for something done wrong, a misguided direction. Furthermore, it conveys the idea of underperformance. On the other hand, "let's speed up!" is well-received and has a positive bias. It's easier to hear and accept ideas such as "close the gap," "get there earlier," "sell more," and "deliver faster."

<!--
Situation of hussle, an action park 
--> 

This has become the norm. So normal, in fact, that we no longer notice situations where more speed, more effort, leads us down a slower path. The office space in fact does a service in that direction, as a workplace for "let's speed up" where any potential negative outcome is mutated into a challenging beast. In the hustle of how things happens and before anyone points out problems in the park, another scream of "let's speed up folks" chimes in. This next one does the service of accelerating the what went slow - as opposed to what went wrong - thus forcing justice through the goggles that the effort wasn't enough. It normally comes like "Folks, we didn't do well. Or, well enough. Well, we did great. We can do more." Then when more mistakes gets closer to the fan the spirits are lifted with a "now is the time" that mobilizes the team to action while a manager-of-chaos theorist says that "life finds a way." In this lobby a banner falls from the ceiling that reads "When Barbarians Ruled the Earth." It is a reminder for them that they aren't barbarians, even when things are a bit chaotic. It gives them the human touch that justifies that the park out of control is just part of the success equation - it's fight for results which is worth it. Additionally, as long as there are cokes and free ice cream available in the park, and a generous and charismatic investor who spared no expense, things will be fine. 

<!--
Situation of one that raises the hand? No 
--> 

Anyone crying out for breathing likely gets an "Eyes of tiger!," which does more of a service as a call to effort than real action. And anyone that speaks out a hint of distress earn themselves a 'whiner' flair on their jacket. Not too big, not too offensive, and quite colored or fun, but enough to silence the whinning call but not enough to lose the soldier. And if, as a whole, the crew speaks of stopping the movement, similarly the critic disguised as managemer chimes in to offer a helping hand, pouring enough rain on the parade but not enough to cloud the horizon and hide the rainbow. In other words, the corporate setting carries the duty to maintain the equilibrium, to keep serving the spirits high, and to ensure that the flow is incessant. If we zoom out from what into how things happens, it's a language borne of a passive-aggressive culture, favoring managers or actually non-managing managers, who lean heavily on extracting from human resources. On this train, however, the human resource essentially becomes the coal. Expenditure is now the manager  coordinates its duty - it is through a narrative of "we can't waste time" or "waste is not an option" that the corporate setting becomes wasteful. And so, in this perceived "highly performant" modern management, after unaccounted losses, that the train approaches the next station, no matter how turbulent was the ride, finds a station that welcomes everyone as heroes, even before a hand it raised. If it is, gets a colored popsicle. It is time for a celebration, takes the moment for any reflective thought, that honors. So they think, "if we've exerted so much energy and burned our resources in the so many attempts, if some of us have been lost along the way, let's then have a moment of silence - we respect our soldiers. Then let's follow by a few hearty hours of celebration. It's the people's feast that takes place, with lambs and sloths and carps and anchovies and orangutans and breakast cereals and fruit and bats and needless to say guacamole and the option to return home a couple hours early. For those who orchestrated the show, up to the station, a promotion is in order, for a couple leaders representing a team of soldiers; comes swiftly as a cost-effective approach to elevate the real heroes, the subordinates. Not only cost effective but it prevents a revolt and at the same time lifts the spirits to keep moving. The train can't lost its momentum, it's fire, them fuel. This situation sadly meshes with the narratives of modern corporate management. Especially when the organization validates the strategy as sound and coherent, then the fast-paced mode goes well as a supporting system for increased efficiency. Althought some organizations are closer or far from this unsweet spot, it is not an incoherent possibility as some of that shows a degree of ethical hue. It's moral, since it ties with a human value that effort makes change. 

<!--
Complication but connecting with more abstract prompt
--> 

In perspectve, we promote action as the approach to be a productive space, on one hand. And on the other hand, a system that forgets the being, as if making them shoppers of solutions and missing the fact that they become shoppers which correlate to becoming less humans. Thus we make or space to be less likely to see that we can be lost among choices, among stories, with data, and worse, capable and able to come up with good narratives that justifies moving on. But this space can be misleading in its nature as if there were a social algorithm that incessantly teases to focus on targetting outcomes, and shopping for solutions to serve outcomes, as opposed to reflecting and revisiting our core structure of how things are done. 

<!-- 
Elaboration on complication, with questions 
--> 

And what would be that structure? The being, human beings, especially when we are in a small boat. Thus, the environment might offer a space for ourselves to mislead ourselves as we account us as good decision makers, as we confuse speed of making decisions with making good decisions, as we can't see that a life of picking from a basket of cheap solutions actually in fact is training ourselves as expendable beings. In other words, the fast-paced situation in the modern context of entrepreneurship treats entrepreneurs like expendable front-line soldiers dragged into action. In this entrepreneurial ecosystem, not to say jungle, the navigation in the urgent way prompts entrepreneurs into the situation where the ends justifies the means, an outcome-driven nature. By ignoring ourselves, our willpower, our energy, we get used to the business of ignoring the vital force in the people around us. In other words, the ecosystem sets us to ignore the management of entrepreneurship, right from the start, although the start is when it is most needed. 

<!-- 
Elaboration on Q/a
--> 
The illustrations given are exercises that portrays a work pace that is both accelerated and frenetic, which has become the norm in the world of work, particularly in the corporate sphere. Has this become the standard because people are simply eager to finish the plan they've started? Is it due to a fear of losing what seems to be working, or what has already been invested, and facing the inherent risk of what is new and demands planning? Or, perhaps, is it because employees are, above all, measured by efficiency and result metrics tied to the present? Alternatively, maybe the acceleration and pursuit of efficiency stem from the natural pressure of a competitive work process that is inherently based on comparisons. 

<!--
Q/A for entrepreneurs 
-->
These possible questions might signal that entrepreneurs aren't disconnected from the general context where entrepreneurship thrives - such as the growth situation of work that is produced by other entrepreneurs that are ahead in situation of managing business. Therefore, it is undeniable that the the competitive environment, the outcome-drive nature, of how business are done, becomes a factor influencing anyone willing to step up, to make a startup, influencing the art and science of entrepreneurship. 

<!--
Reasoning answer, guiding enlightment that management of entrepreneurship is a must 
--> 
Thus the focus area in our book comes down to reflecting on this accelerated pace that entrepreneurs might fit and how it impacts everything precisely at in the moment that we need energy, like willpower, and good ideas, and the right conditions to move on and achieve growth as individuals and for our organizations. What stands before us is the prioritization of the startup foundation, not a focus given to the pursuit of a valuable solution for a potential customer, in the direction that the end justifies the means. As we delve into the slowing down the fast-paced situation of entrepreneurship, we also touch on the age-old problem of navigation, the map of the story, the how to walk the story, more than a problem of speed. Andy Grove, in the book "High Output Management," reminds us of an old saying that if you don't know where you're going, any path will take you there [^editornote_andy_anyroad]. 

[^editornote_andy_anyroad]: This saying, according to Andy Grove, is an indian saying. Others say it's from elsewhere. But if Andy brought to his book, it is a saying necessary to acknowledge; just like Peter Drucker, as cited in the foreword, has reminded us that the balance between activities is connected to the organization of organization. 

<!--
Another aspect of how we experience - Data and information 
--> 
Beyond what seems to be a narrative pushing for accelerated effort, the fast-paced mode of execution has also infiltrated the context of management analysis and planning. Things have not sped up simply because people are running more, working more intensively, or because managers coordinate the frantic pace because they enjoy it. The fast mode is supported by functions, or resources, that are “ready” and available at hand. In the American Wild West, a saw in the hand of a carpenter was a piece of work that deserved attention and care, finding the correct speed, finding the correct use. An apprentice considering the tool would find a mentor, perhaps in the form of a master, but there was an environment for learning. In the modern reality of the knowledge manager, data have come to be used as tools, as mechanisms to accelerate decisions. [There is an article by Peter Drucker that says technology is work. Perhaps it is a special foundation that justifies this almost aberration where data become tools. On one hand, an aberration, on the other, it is necessary to talk about it because this is being done in day-to-day operations.] The former CEO of Intel, Andy Grove, in "Arguing with Data," warned [^grovefastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people should argue their debates with data already in hand (GROVEDATA, p.116).

[^grovefastdata]: In Andy Grove's book, "Only the Paranoid Survive," the quoted phrase in English reads, “Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It’s good advice. All too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis.” The warning applies to what he termed a "Strategic Inflection Point," situations so adverse and unexpected that they befuddle companies. Intel survived crises of this magnitude and later also became a leading player. In these situations, the anticipatory data can be misleading.

This form of operating decisions — with data — provokes us to reflect upon the mechanization of cognition, which runs together to the pressure of greater efficiency at work. The presence of data becomes concrete, providing people with good data which supports good reasons when faced with a decision that needs to be made. Data captivate us, certainly, because they work so well, when they do work. Like a tool, like a saw.

<!--
( ) Consider to put a Peter Drucker on Communications, note about information and Communication
--> 

In the interconnected and turbulent world, experts are constantly under pressure to provide "faster" and more modern solutions for things they are already familiar with. Why send individual emails when you can send a million at once? It seems as though all available solutions appear useful and efficient. Additionally, in this chaotic environment, when you seek assistance, it’s not hard to find a multitude of resources available that, in one way or another, say "yes, I can help." These resources are experts in their fields, ready to execute what they know, showcasing their expertise. A programmer who codes faster, an engineer who calculates more quickly. The tools are more automated, and the data, now more readily available, are ready to assist in decision-making. Amidst this immediate availability of models, it’s easy to get swept up in the current—let’s face it—and choose solutions that promise quicker delivery among the options, without reconsidering the strategy of the process itself.

Being an action in the language, the availability of data, and tools that are now connected with data, an inertial force conveniently asks us to continue on that highly performant execution path - precisely because the external reference point, for navigation, is ignored. In this world, where speed can accelerate any specialty, we are led to believe that we can move even faster, even if we make mistakes or take a detour. Failing faster and learning is a theme that makes sense. 

However, reflection is necessary and important, as getting to the wrong place faster not only means delay but also implies the consumption of energy, resources, willpower, and motivation. Therefore, it can't be said that entrepreneurs will promptly jump into the action, the data, and the tools that support flow decisions; exactly because anyone willing to engage in entrepreneurship is now equipped with stories, methods, and systems that are made for entrepreneurs. Therefore, there is an ecosystem of entrepreneurship available which does cover the theme specialists vs. generalist. 

The renowned Steve Blank has acknowledged and addressed a fundamental issue with startups when he revealed a vision he had in 2014. According to Steve, the precursor idea of the lean movement is that entrepreneurs think their ideas can be materialized as smaller versions of large companies. Steve states that "startups are not smaller versions of large companies," emphasizing the difference between a startup and an established company. He notes that a startup is in the discovery phase, which differs from a large company that has already identified its role in the market and has a validated product. When ideas are not validated, operating as if it were a large company is very dangerous and risky since the young company is in the process of discovery and has limited resources for betting. 

Therefore, by now, much about this subject (not operating as a large company and recognizing the discovery phase) exists in startup literature and is also present in the world of platforms, methodologies, and startup structures.

But a decade later, the lean startup movement, and the whole entrepreneurial ecosystem, grew in size and within the sea of abundance as indicated; which brought entrepreneurs to be lost in the sea of ready-made solutions, that puts them equally harassed by specialized solutions - likely driven by a specialized mindset - which sets them in a cockpit that promises high performance startup development as an option that leads to innovation; which offers "plug-and-play" options from the urgent world, such as the abudant world of lean methodologies, frameworks, platforms of all sorts and supporting systems by too many choices in terms of growingh startups, such as when a team decides to join, in the pressure to advance, a bootcamp, enroll in an incubator, dive into an accelerator, participate in a contest, and other participations with collaboration that promisses potential results that would perhaps sling them into even faster growth. These are situations that promise acceleration and claim to solve the entrepreneur's journey. 

Although we can't blame abundance, still the reality is that it is a strong idea that leads entrepreneurs to rush into acting as reactive entrepreneurs on instinct, for example, when they scramble to seek solutions that they think are things that startups do. Similarly, entrepreneurs might, in their urgent processes, flee from corporate behavior - or a general cultural machine of interacting and producing - and be drawn to the automatic behavior typical of how startups do. For example, they may become immersed in lean processes, enamored with the processes, promote that they are practicing lean while they are actually procrastinating [^editornote_procrastination_lean]with lean, and much more.

[^editornote_procrastination_lean]: A further chapter shows the interview with Steve Blank where the talking about lean without doing lean appears as a potential phenomenon.

When we are hungry for the breakfast and in front of the all-you-can-it buffet, with solutions for everything for all the phases of growth, the crew feels empowered to pick more. And worse of all, taken from the beauty of all, entrepreneurship rises from a hungry spirit, on one hand, and on the other entrepreneurship demands the crew to accept that digestion problems are part of the course. Thus, entrepreneurship calls for growth and growth supports call to action, such as to eat more and to shop more. 

This complication was also recognized by Eric Ries in his book "The Startup Way," after his observation where entrepreneurs that use lean are challenge [^footnote_eric_ries_startup_way_give_up] by a hurryness to give up as soon as they can, as in they fall into executing in a more traditional way as soon as they can. A possibility, or anxiety, for that behavior might not be only come from the urge to succeed but from pressures or a model from the - that influences the perception - growth-up situation, or growth system, that appears ahead of anyone involved in startup growth [^editornote_paulgraham_growth], which is short would be like saying that we do some initial check about an idea so that we can convince others to give us more resources so that we can engage in higher bets which are likely like what grown up corporations do. 

[^footnote_eric_ries_startup_way_give_up]: 

[^editornote_paulgraham_growth]: Paul Graham covers both the aspect that startups are for a growth situation but also covers that founders follow instincs such as a willingness to play the game. The through of sorrow of Paul Graham also depicts that startups force their status as political, projections, leading to falling in their own traps, such as to be sad that their projections were not real.

#### Where we are going we don't need roads 

This book challenges entrepreneurs to embrace the principle that begins with the courage, or permission, to say no, or to give up on boarding a high-speed train that is typically taken just because others do so. It's not necessarily about joining the club because the beat seems to be the "beat of the moment." The greatest abuse an entrepreneur can commit is when they start to sacrifice their identity, trample over their highest value, leading to confusion, or fusion, defining an identity that results in burnout.

We will see that based on respect for the entrepreneurial spirit, we will be freeing ourselves for conscious entrepreneurship that is more immune to the noise of the environment. In the urgent, fast-paced, and turbulent world, the entrepreneur needs to act. However, these actions should not arise from arbitrary pressures that lead entrepreneurs to ignore the strategic issues of work conduct. 

In other words, we aim a strategy that ceases to be reactive or speed-oriented from the pressures clamoring for results. Thus we will set themselves to avoid resorting to abuses that form a toxic culture centered where the end justifies the means. In such a culture, work dances with the bursts of motivational incentives, while possible signs of an environment detrimental to the work itself and the development of the team's work methodology are silenced.The strategy cannot be reduced to just going with the flow, under the shadow of the world’s accelerated pace. We don’t just want speed, to run for the sake of running. On the contrary, we need to learn as we execute, but leaning about growth both as individuals and as leaders of our organizations. By doing so, we create a learning organization, which is one of the goals of this reflection and opportunity. 

Therefore, we bring situations, complications, and reflections that were not designed as recipes, as ready-made solutions to solve the adversities and complexities of the urgent mode. The idea is to strengthen the entrepreneurial side of the entrepreneur — so that when you are confronted with chaos, and pressure, and a "normal" crazyness at work which is incessant urgent and rarely seen as toxic and that is actually presented as a price to pay, or the norm, for success. In this sense, Fried and Hansson [^basecampcrazy] invite us to reflect:

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried and Hansson are the founders of Basecamp, a well-known company from Silicon Valley focused on productivity. In the book "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," they argue that it is necessary to work against the industry's toxic instincts and norms that avoids the possibility of managing a company calmly. The expression "It's crazy at work" is used by them to describe a work environment where pressure, such as excessive working hours, and consequences like anxiety, are the norm; and they reject this idea in favor of a calmer and more balanced work environment.

> "Infelizmente, administrar uma empresa de maneira tranquila não é o modo padrão de gerir uma empresa atualmente. Você precisa ir contra seus instintos por um tempo. Você precisa deixar de lado as normas tóxicas da indústria. Você precisa reconhecer que 'É loucura no trabalho' não está certo." (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 9, tradução nossa).

With the goal of running less arbitrarily, and creating conditions for conscious actions, entrepreneurs need a more suitable approach to navigate this environment which, without a conscious attitude, proves to be frustrating and exhausting. This approach, above all, begins with something that is internal rather than external, requiring a regulation to the compulsive tendency to constantly seek solutions from the outside. In this sense, this material is not made for a machine. Our most essential reference is valuing the human being as the foundation of the entrepreneurial spirit. In other words, our strategy does not involve selling out the human being as part of the process, discarding our greatest resource. This idea necessarily creates a force, or principle, of self-respect in terms of setting boundaries, but these are justified in order to create well-being for the entrepreneur and the enterprise. This will be our guide for many of our reflections in the three parts to come.

The first part, entitled "Behavioral Urgency," deals with the nature of the entrepreneur, an introspection, as it is useless to discuss the dangers and pitfalls of the urgent world without analyzing habits and behaviors. With this, we enrich a basic framework of principles that will guide us in the accelerated world, against traps.

The second agenda, "Interpersonal Urgency," is an opportunity for us to reflect on our accelerated communication in the environment where people collaborate. We will look at how the reactive and urgent mode of execution creates pressure for urgent entrepreneurship where actions have become more specialized, with ready-made solutions for everything and where we are always engaged, such as the propensity for entrepreneurs to execute their plans with support from interactive platforms where the protagonists are registered and participating actively. Our reflection does not ask entrepreneurs to stop navigating this world. It asks for a little less precision in execution and more attention to knowing how to guide themselves. This will be an opportunity to reflect on the fact that the world's agenda, even if it is super efficient, is not always compatible with the developing agenda of the entrepreneur and their venture; consequently affecting their goals and dreams.

The last part is an opportunity to look at the entrepreneur who grows their organization that seeks to develop a sustainable work entity but in an external environment that, as evident everywhere, is connected, urgent, transactional. In this part, the reflection will allow us to consider that we will be growing an organization in an environment that generates pressure and that in all forms of entities are connected and influencing control - through platforms, networks, systems, tools, technologies, and more.

This is a book for everyone who supports entrepreneurs, but particularly for those who care about them and are concerned with their health and their psychological well-being; hence for those who do not think that entrepreneurs are expendable. They are the ones in the arena, and it is a complicated space, full of urgencies and a fast-paced nature, which could prompt them into action and a natural inclination to miss the space for evaluating themselves. Thus, it becomes a book for entrepreneurs themselves as naturally, they will likely be alone at times, and will bear the responsibility to grow themselves, to learn and adapt from experiences. Being open to enlightenment should be acknowledged as part of entrepreneurship. This is especially necessary as entrepreneurs are expected to be in a position to change reality, to free themselves from the normal way things are done, which requires adapting and changing themselves. Entrepreneurial action invites new management.
