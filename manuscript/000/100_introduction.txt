## Acelerar é cultura ou sobrevivência?

When someone says "let's slow down", it usually doesn't sound good, particularly in the workplace where people collaborate. It sounds negative, like a warning that says "danger ahead", or it conveys an idea of low performance. On the other hand, "let's speed up!" is an idea that often goes unnoticed with a positive bias. It's easier to hear and accept ideas like "arrive earlier", "sell more" or "deliver faster".

All this has become normal. So normal, in fact, that we no longer notice the numerous situations where greater speed leads us down a slower path. Also, it's not uncommon to experience proposals of "let's speed up" that generate a negative result which can be corrected with "let's speed up even more!"

Perhaps the acceleration became normal because people are simply eager to finish the plan they've started? Or perhaps, it's the acceleration that results from a previous move, a step that has already been taken in the first place. If we're on the right path, well, why not speed up? Or even when the acceleration comes because we're actually competing and comparing, whether with your own work or with others'. In this inclination, in a competitive environment of comparison (or competition), performance is indeed what matters: Move faster than the other; Deliver faster compared to the previous speed. All of this even makes sense, for instance when the strategy is defined, validated, and secured. So, it's not just about speeding up but that speeding up is easier and often even ethical, in the sense of the expected performance improvement given that the work rules are already defined.

### Models for Acceleration 

But modern, accelerated execution also infiltrated the dynamics of analysis and planning in the world of work. Things did not get faster just because people run more or work more intensively. Today, the fast mode is supported by functions and resources that are "ready-made" and are indeed in people's hands - resources beyond tools like a saw in the hand of a carpenter during the industrial revolution. Now resources can also be models, which function as shortcuts and are indeed the mechanisms for accelerating decisions.

Former Intel CEO, Andy Grove, in Arguing with data (Arguing with Data), long ago warned[^grovefastdata] that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management which suggests that people should argue their debates with the data already at hand (GROVEDATA, p.116).

[^grovefastdata]: In Andy's book, Only the Paranoid Survive, the quoted phrase in English is “*Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It's good advice. Altogether too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis. *“ The warning applies to the situation he called Strategic Inflection Point, situations so adverse and unexpected that confuse companies. Intel survived crisis situations of this magnitude and later also became the protagonist. In these situations, the data that anticipate can be deceiving. ↩

This mechanical way of managing decisions - with data - can be seen as a certain mechanization of cognition, of operating more efficiently in modern work; but that captivates us because it works so well when it does, when the path is pre-traced, that we assume it works in general.

## When Models and Data Become Traps

On the other hand, unexpected waves appear — new winds blow. When adverse situations are in front of teams, they need other solutions because what is being done often needs to be reconsidered. These traps attack all environments that need innovation, like large companies experiencing moments of greatest success. In the aforementioned book, Only the Paranoid Survive, Andy talks about what Intel went through when it was the largest manufacturer of memories in the world but almost failed to notice the invisible data, the new winds: Intel survived and fought against its fast force and realized it needed to navigate differently - it moved from the memory industry, which would be dominated by the Japanese, to manufacturing chips. Today we know Intel as one of the largest computer chip manufacturers in the world. Also, Christensen, in the book Innovator's Dilemma, presents scenarios of large companies that continued in fast mode, with data, and failed to see the need for reinventing their products.

### Focus on the Entrepreneur

The issue is that this urgent, high-pressure mode, overflowing with data and models, is also prevalent in the life of the entrepreneur. Today, entrepreneurs can also make accelerated decisions, even if they are just starting out, in the phase of understanding, creation, design, when ideas are still budding.

This is the space where our focus is born: In entrepreneurship, in the routine that creates room for ideas and in creating conditions for these ideas to be transformed into market value. In the endurance race of entrepreneurship, when the fog is thick, speeding up is not the best option. To those who do so, when "accelerate" is the strategy, it is better to wish them good luck because one thing is guaranteed — they will enter a spiral that leads more quickly to a mediocre destination, consuming, wearing out, and potentially leading to the end of the idea, the potential of the business, and even harming the entrepreneur's ability to learn, or even demotivate.

The renowned Steve Blank addressed the fundamental question about the problem when he revealed the insight (????, MAP14) he had. According to him, the precursor idea of the lean movement is that entrepreneurs think their ideas can be materialized as small versions of large companies. Steve says that "startups are not small versions of big companies," that the difference between a startup and an established company is that the startup is in the discovery phase, which is different from the large company that has already identified its role in the market and has a validated product. When ideas are not validated, operating as if you were a large company is very serious; since the young enterprise is in discovery, besides there being no abundance of resources.

## The Real Trap

Much about this subject (not operating like a big company and recognizing the discovery phase) exists in the startup literature and is also present in the world of platforms, methodologies, and frameworks of startups. But still, entrepreneurs trying to execute their processes in lean mode continue to fall into the traps of the accelerated world and execution: They continue to be mounted in the supposedly light system full of hope. A system that depends on light, on the hope of dreams, a promising system. In this condition, it is not easy to realize that the fast system conditions them to be harassed or victimized.

The issue of how the entrepreneur faces this challenge, which involves facing challenges between discovery and execution, can be reflected/addressed by considering the comparison between the specialist profile versus the generalist. Most people are specialists because being a specialist is a useful piece for the gears of companies. The problem is that when the entrepreneur operates as a specialist, they will compare their work with the benchmark of a specialist. Consider a bullet train that travels at 370 kilometers per hour. The person gets into the wagon, and the train runs to the destination. From the inside out, the person sitting has the benchmark as being the interior of the wagon. They perceive the movement of other people, the coming and going, and the stops at the stations. From the inside, the speed of the train is not perceived. It is slow. It would only be if the person were both inside and outside the train at the same time. The specialist profile is immersed in the experience, focusing on potential action on a movement. The specialist runs more risk of not even asking if all of this makes sense. Moreover, when under pressure, the easy default option is to do more of the same. Worse, without an external benchmark, they don't even know if it is pressure.

### Fast Models Have Reached the Initial Phase of Innovation

To make matters worse, in the 21st century and in the face of a hyper-connected world, there is an infinity of technologies and methods that support actions and decisions. Everything is available with the promise to elevate, to accelerate. The letter, which was written at the table, became an email drafted on a computer. The email, in turn, became a message sent from a mobile phone, "typed" by a voice command from inside a car. With this, we are all equally fast or "slow". A person on a horse is faster than someone on foot but slower than someone on a train. If the person on the train, delivering a simple message, is unaware of a better solution, such as electronic messaging, they simply won't know because they may think they are going fast, or worse, they may believe that accelerating generates better results.

Entering into the problem of modernity, or all times, continues to be the same old problem of navigation; more than a problem of speed. The mistake, or "bug" that entrepreneurs make has more to do with anxiety and deep-rooted convenience. Andy Grove, in the book High Output Management, reminds us of an old saying that if you don't know where you're going, any path will get you there.

What happens in this interconnected and turbulent world is that specialists are constantly harassed with faster and more modern solutions to things they already know. Why send individual emails when you can send a million emails at once? It's as if all available solutions sound useful, they sound like efficient solutions. Also, in this turbulent ocean, when you ask for help, it's not hard to find a multitude of sailors, experts in their fields, ready to execute what they know how to do - the specialist side. A programmer who codes faster, an engineer who calculates faster. The tools, more automated. And the data, now available earlier and ready to help you with the decision. In the midst of this immediate availability of models, it's easy to get on the wagon - and let's face it - choose solutions that promise to deliver faster.

But it's also equally convenient to continue on the same path, precisely because the external reference point, of navigation, is ignored. In this world, where speed can accelerate any specialty, a new perspective is important since arriving faster at the wrong place not only means delay but also implies the consumption of energy, resources, and even willpower and motivation.

In this sea of ready-made solutions, the entrepreneur can participate in a bootcamp, enroll in an incubator, and then plunge into an accelerator. These are examples that accelerate and promise to also solve the entrepreneur's concerns. This is the harassment of "just do it" that is no longer limited to solutions for specialists. Now, the generalist side is equally besieged by an overload of “plug-and-play” options from the urgent world. The worst part is that entrepreneurs cannot simply ignore these tools, solutions, processes, and modern methods. All these are the available tools, which are there to solve, if well used.

With the aim of running less to anywhere and making smaller bets, the entrepreneur needs a more suitable approach to navigate this frustrating and exhausting environment. This approach, above all, needs to come from within them, as trying to operate in the ways of others does not make the entrepreneur an effective gear for their own future. With this, everything begins with the principle of self-respect. Thus, this book brings up entrepreneurship issues in such a way that the entrepreneur does not become a person adrift from what they believe. This principle begins with permission, to deny or quit - not necessarily get on the "bullet train" just because other entrepreneurs do. Not necessarily enter the nightclub because the beat seems to be the "beat of the hour". The greatest abuse of the entrepreneur is when they start to trample their identity, their goals and objectives, when they see that the world is different and start to operate like the signals beside them (in the view of this book, presented as noise).

From this you will say - ah then this book is another available resource that sells one more quick idea amid this urgent world here stamped. Perhaps this is the book's catch, yes. An approach to slow down to get to what you want faster? In the urgent, fast and turbulent world, the entrepreneur needs to move fast indeed, but needs strategy - their strategy. One that does not involve walking for the sake of walking in the shadow of the world. That is, it's not speed they want, running for the sake of running. On the contrary, they need to perform, learn and grow - the meaning of this book. Here are resources and situations that do not promise to solve everything, but represent an opportunity for reflection. The idea is to strengthen the entrepreneur to counter the overload of resources and the noise that harasses and does not necessarily apply to their journey. In this opportunity, with this honest approach, the goal is for the entrepreneur to be able to focus on their most productive and happy agenda because it is a fact, the journey is difficult and uncertain. With self-respect and a conscious vision, the entrepreneur's steps become more productive and their chances are greater.
For this, the following are 3 agendas for reading and reflection, which the entrepreneur should do in their own time but preferably before accelerating. The first part, entitled The Urgent Entrepreneur, deals with the nature of the entrepreneur, a look inward, because it's useless to elaborate on the dangers and pitfalls of the urgent world without looking at habits and behaviors. With this, we enrich a basic structure of principles for actions.

The second agenda, Entrepreneurship in the Urgent World, looks at the external environment, the world that has become urgent and is constantly harassing the entrepreneur with the specialist approach, plug-and-play solutions, and interactive platforms that demand the entrepreneur to sign up and participate. Navigating this world is less about precision than about knowing how to guide oneself. This will be an opportunity for reflection on the fact that, not always, the world's agenda, even if it is super efficient, is compatible with the entrepreneur's agenda in construction, their objectives and dreams.

The last part is an opportunity to look at the entrepreneur as the protagonist of the urgent world, in control, who takes advantage of modern tools and technologies but does not become a victim. This protagonism suggests approaches for the entrepreneur to advance, enhancing speed through the development of a strong culture, thus healing their process, their culture, and work team. At no point does the book suggest that the entrepreneur break their principles, the basic premise of the book that is rooted in the first agenda. So, let's go, let's deal, first, with the urgent entrepreneur.
