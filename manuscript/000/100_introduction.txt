--> 

If an arbitrary says "let's slow down!" in a modern workplace it doesn't sound good. One other may even respond to that asking to "hold your horses!" When they pause, they may do so to briefly wonder "what is it now that we need to stop doing what we are doing?" On the other hand, the "let's speed up!" or the modern version the "keep craking" appeals as a sign of support as if they are in the right direction. It sonds coherent, it goes with "let's close the gap," "get there earlier," "sell more," "deliver faster," "get there early," and "be the first," and more.

* outline - introduction - #Situation of fun to work, hetic, "perks" support a fast-paced culture.  
--> 

I invite you imagine an office where the moto is "it's fun to work". The space looks like an amuzement park and there is even a dinossaur made of beverage cans, and an yet-to-be-completed bridge that depends on the pace and the intake of soft drinks by the developers. In this culture, there are beasts to be defeated, as opposed to a calmer, even boring, space of work. If one even thinks about bringing up a complication with the team's strategy, an invisible but pragmatic hand increases the fader of "let's speed up folks" while the channel of "things aren't right" is silenced. It's a music remixed in a way that does justice to effort, to rithm, and fast-paced cadence first. But then when things really go wrong, an automatic course-correction response appears in the form of "folks, we didn't do well. Or, well enough. Well, we did great, although we can do more." Therefore, as more of the same action hits the fan, the spirits get back on track with the chorus of "let's not lose the momentum!" In the background, an unofficial and solitary track appears as "life finds a way" but no one heard anyway. But as long as there is life in this park, the adventure won't stop. A sign in the lobby reads "When Dinousaurs Ruled the Earth," reaffirms that humans are in control even when all seems to be chaotic. And if anyone insists in taking too seriously - to pause the party and claim that management is acting weird - the actual physical hallways brings back the colorfulness and the incidental soft drink dispenser and premium quality ice cream which make us all remember the charismatic investor who spared no expense. which reaffirms the "it's fun to work" place which is not to be taken too serious which supports the let's get back on track.

Try to cry for a breath, you will get an "eyes of tiger!" Try to spark distress and you earn a 'whiner' flair on your jacket. But a flair not too big, not too offensive, quite colored and fun; and enough to silence your "whinning call" but not enough to lose you as a warrior. In other words, when the crew speaks that too many man and too many people are making too many problems, a critical manager is right there, pronto, and offers a helping hand that pours enough rain on the parade but not enough to cloud the horizon and the rainbow. In other words, the corporate setting carries the duty to maintain the equilibrium, keep serving the spirits, and to ensure that flow is incessant. 

If this high-speed train were real, it treats human resources like coal. In an extremme, this language promotes a culture of "we can't waste time," or "waste is not an option," but in doing so it makes the work place to become wasteful in its essence. But not in the surface, unfortunatelly, as it is perceived and promoted as an express - a highly performant train that incessantly arrives at the next station, no matter how turbulent was the ride. It can be difficult to stop our brains to read the underlying nature of this fast-moving train; because we happened to be dropped from the air after an "if you chose to accept this mission". And indeed, when the train seems to rest in a station, its crew quickly enters the celebration mode as opposed to get into the boring, reflective, never-ending, frustrating, and painful analysis of a post-mortem nature. On the contrary, the resting at the stations coherently speaks that "if we've exerted so much energy, and given that some of us have been lost along the way, let's just go ahead and have a moment of silence, let's just go ahead and respect our efforts, our soldiers, our resources." That call is enough to take our attention away from the reflection, and any spark for a revolution. Now it is the time for our moods to be energized, again, so the people joins with the lambs and sloths and carps and anchovies and orangutans, and breakast cereal, and fruits and bats, and of course the guacamole plus all of that goes well with the option to return home a couple hours early. Moreover, if everyone suddenly are the heroes of such an effort, it is then plausibly required a promotion which happens to go for the ones who stood for them, the ones that did the magic to supress any revolt, the ones that kept pouring the spirits high, the ones that kept the momentum going, that the fire burning. 

But in perspective, if any of that language of action exists, it might do so as a result of an passive-aggressive work environment that favors a situation that leans heavily on extracting effort from humans. Althought guacamole could be evidently present [^footnote_guacamole_traning] in some of the best working places, it is arguably unfair to celebrate the exagerations given by these illustrations such as the implied idea that an action-oriented style of management, as opposed to real management, is the main beast we should fear. But the truth that I am after - throughout my attempt to turn what appears to be fun into bitterness - lies in considering the dangers of our inclination, as humans, to rather grab the wheel and pursue the end no matter the means. Not a truth sought by the modern worker that operates  a mechanical equipment that put the life of their colleagues at risk, but in the sense of an entrepreneur that enters into entrepreneurship as if it is a car and suddently focuses on the road ahead, and feels that the equipment is there to accelerate into the destination, and by doing so denies to invest in developing consciousness for its behaviors, such as the management of entrepreneurship. 

[^footnote_guacamole_traning]: In the 2018 ASU GSV Summit during the Main Stage Panel titled "The Future of Talent -- Transcending Work," Rob Biederman, Co-Founder and CEO of Catalant Technologies, highlighted an intriguing aspect of corporate spending priorities. He pointed out that a large company which likely the audience were shareholders, allocates less budget per employee on training than his own startup spends on avocados. This remark emphasizes the disparity in investment priorities, particularly in training and education, compared to seemingly trivial expenses like avocados (Global Silicon Valley, 2018) expect that it may not be trivial in the sense of keeping the train moving as it is.

* outline - introduction - #SCqA #Question #Complication - Should we wait a bit?
--> 

Therefore, I rather pull the hand brake and invite us to take another turn, and to consider that our need for speed drives us into a land of confusion that harms work in general, that harms us as entrepreneurs, that harms us as human beings, therefore the development of humanity. 

<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - introduction - #Complication that Managers are followers?
--> 

To put in perspective, in the light of our strategy throught the book, the recognition of that language of action - particularly illustrated in the corporate sphere - is a starting point so that we can consider who we are, or who we are likely to become, when we are willing to thrive, to achieve, to beat the competition, to win, to survive, you name it. As an example, consider that our propensity to drive by key results, such as seeking key results connected with outcomes, rises from the individual which makes it synergentically projected in the collaborative situations of work. In the same perspective, it isn't a higher-order force, such as the above layers of management of a given organization, that brought us to where we are, such as to when we behave as urgent beings. In fact, we brought ourselves there as our success made a new world that we are into - the world of abundance of tools, resources, information, and the hyper-fast potential of a network. 

<!--

--> 

And this situation, which is undeniably good, actually sets a challenge ahead of entrepreneurs, such as if you consider that an arbitrary entrepreneur might not see an inferno ahead, a so clear reason to free the world, and more importantly to the context of our book, so clear reason to execute entrepreneurship differently. In other words, if we are running along, or rolling, in the pace of the corporate sphere, anb in the pace of the urgent and networked world, we may have no reasons to break through, to think through, to break the norm, to break the speed, to break automatic responses, and so on. And this becomes a major complication for us, entrepreneurs or anyone that cares about them, and anyone who cares about humanity, because the environment of our success gives the means, such as an inclusive, or easy, or cheap, or acessible, of supporting an arbitraty entrepreneur such as one in a hurry, to just jump into actions, as if they had a "Jump to Conclusions Mat" where they can jump to. 

Thus the focus area in our book comes down to reflecting on this accelerated pace that entrepreneurs might fit and how it impacts everything precisely at in the moment that we need energy, like willpower, and good ideas, and the right conditions to move on and achieve growth as individuals and for our organizations. What stands before us is the prioritization of the startup foundation, in the opposed direction where the end justifies the means. As we delve into the slowing down the fast-paced situation of entrepreneurship, we also touch on the age-old problem of navigation, the map of the story, the how to walk the story, more than a problem of speed. Andy Grove, in the book "High Output Management," reminds us of an old saying that if you don't know where you're going, any path will take you there [^editornote_andy_anyroad]. 

[^editornote_andy_anyroad]: This saying, according to Andy Grove, is an indian saying. Others say it's from elsewhere. But if Andy brought to his book, it is a saying necessary to acknowledge; just like Peter Drucker, as cited in the foreword, has reminded us that the balance between activities is connected to the organization of organization.

Another aspect of how we experience - Data and information 
--> 

Beyond what seems to be a narrative pushing for accelerated effort, the fast-paced mode of execution has also infiltrated the context of management analysis and planning. Things have not sped up simply because people are running more, working more intensively, or because managers coordinate the frantic pace because they enjoy it. The fast mode is supported by functions, or resources, that are “ready” and available at hand. 

In the modern reality of the knowledge worker, data have come to be used as tools, as mechanisms to accelerate decisions. The former CEO of Intel, Andy Grove, in "Arguing with Data," warned [^grovefastdata] readers that large companies are indoctrinated by contemporary management, suggesting that people should argue their debates with data already in hand (GROVEDATA, p.116).

[^grovefastdata]: In Andy Grove's book, "Only the Paranoid Survive," the quoted phrase in English reads, “Contemporary management doctrine suggests that you should approach any debate and argument with data in hand. It’s good advice. All too often, people substitute opinions for facts and emotions for analysis.” The warning applies to what he termed a "Strategic Inflection Point," situations so adverse and unexpected that they befuddle companies. Intel survived crises of this magnitude and later also became a leading player. In these situations, the anticipatory data can be misleading.

--> 

In Technology, Management, and Society, Peter Drucker has contextualized that the situation of information abundance does impact effective communications which was stressed as the kind of communication where the receiver effectively understand and collaborates, as opposed to passively accept the message: 

> *"More and better information does not solve the communication problem, nor does it bridge the communication gap. On the contrary, the more information the greater is the need for functioning and effective communication becomes. The more information available, in other words, the greater is the communications gap likely to be. The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and application, that is, on communications. In the second place, the more effective the information process, the more impersonal and formal will it become, the more will it separate human beings and thereby require separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the human relationships, the relationship of communication. It may be said that the effectiveness of the information process will depend increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of effective communication - that is, in the present situation - the information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can produce is data."*

This form of operating decisions — with data — provokes us to reflect upon what can apparently look like a mechanization of cognition, which runs together with the the pressure of greater efficiency at work. The presence of data becomes concrete, providing people with "good data" which supports good reasons when faced with a decision that needs to be made. Data captivate us, certainly, because they work so well, when they do work.

In the interconnected and turbulent world, experts are constantly under pressure to provide "faster" and more modern solutions for things they are already familiar with. Why send individual emails when you can send a million at once? It seems as though all available solutions appear useful and efficient. Additionally, in this chaotic environment, when you seek assistance, it’s not hard to find a multitude of resources available that, in one way or another, say "yes, I can help." These resources are experts in their fields, ready to execute what they know, showcasing their expertise. A programmer who codes faster, an engineer who calculates more quickly. The tools are more automated, and the data, now more readily available, are ready to assist in decision-making. Amidst this immediate availability of models, it’s easy to get swept up in the current—let’s face it—and choose solutions that promise quicker delivery among the options, without reconsidering the strategy of the process itself.

* outline - SCqA K1 - #Abstraction point that action is not navigation. 
--> 

Being an action in the language, the availability of data, and tools that are now connected with data, an inertial force conveniently asks us to continue on that highly performant execution path - precisely because the external reference point, for navigation, is ignored. In this world, where speed can accelerate any specialty, we are led to believe that we can move even faster, even if we make mistakes or take a detour. Failing faster and learning is a theme that makes sense. 

However, reflection is necessary and important, as getting to the wrong place faster not only means delay but also implies the consumption of energy, resources, willpower, and motivation. Therefore, it can't be said that entrepreneurs will promptly jump into the action, the data, and the tools that support flow decisions; exactly because anyone willing to engage in entrepreneurship is now equipped with stories, methods, and systems that are made for entrepreneurs. Therefore, there is an ecosystem of entrepreneurship available which does cover the theme specialists vs. generalist.

* outline - SCqA K2 - #Abstraction, with #situation-complication, that generalist is not specialist [feat. Steve Blank]
--> 

The renowned Steve Blank has acknowledged and addressed a fundamental issue with startups when he revealed a vision he had in 2014. According to Steve, the precursor idea of the lean movement is that entrepreneurs think their ideas can be materialized as smaller versions of large companies. Steve states that "startups are not smaller versions of large companies," emphasizing the difference between a startup and an established company. He notes that a startup is in the discovery phase, which differs from a large company that has already identified its role in the market and has a validated product. When ideas are not validated, operating as if it were a large company is dangerous and risky since the young company is in the process of discovery and has limited resources for betting. 

By now, much about this subject (not operating as a large company and recognizing the discovery phase) exists in startup literature and is also present in the world of platforms, methodologies, and startup structures. But now a decade later, the lean startup movement, and the whole entrepreneurial ecosystem, grew in size so there literally a sea of solutions to be used by entrepreneurs, that puts them in a position to be harassed by specialized solutions - likely driven by a specialized mindset - which sets them in a cockpit that promises high performance startup development as an option that leads to innovation; which offers "plug-and-play" options from the urgent world, such as the abudant world of lean methodologies, frameworks, platforms of all sorts and supporting systems by too many choices in terms of growingh startups, such as when a team decides to join, in the pressure to advance, a bootcamp, enroll in an incubator, dive into an accelerator, participate in a contest, and other participations with collaboration that promisses potential results that would perhaps sling them into even faster growth. These are situations that promise acceleration and claim to solve the entrepreneur's journey. 

Although we can't blame abundance, still the reality is that it is a strong idea that leads entrepreneurs to rush into acting as reactive entrepreneurs on instinct, for example, when they scramble to seek solutions that they think are things that startups do. Similarly, entrepreneurs might, in their urgent processes, flee from corporate behavior - or a general cultural machine of interacting and producing - and be drawn to the automatic behavior typical of how startups do. For example, they may become immersed in lean processes, enamored with the processes, promote that they are practicing lean while they are actually procrastinating [^editornote_procrastination_lean]with lean, and much more.

[^editornote_procrastination_lean]: A further chapter shows the interview with Steve Blank where the talking about lean without doing lean appears as a potential phenomenon.

When we are hungry for the breakfast and in front of the all-you-can-it buffet, with solutions for everything for all the phases of growth, the crew feels empowered to pick more. And worse of all, taken from the beauty of all, entrepreneurship rises from a hungry spirit, on one hand, and on the other entrepreneurship demands the crew to accept that digestion problems are part of the course. Thus, entrepreneurship calls for growth and growth supports call to action, such as to eat more and to shop more.

Where we are going we don't need roads. This book challenges entrepreneurs to embrace the principle of courage in the first place; or permission such as permission to say no, or to enter in not being so fast in the onboarding of that high-speed train that is typically taken as others do so. It's not necessarily about joining the club because the beat seems to be the "beat of the moment." The greatest abuse an entrepreneur can commit is when they start to sacrifice their identity, trample over their highest value, leading to confusion, or fusion, defining an identity that results in burnout.

We will see that respect for the entrepreneurial body and mind, establishing the path of conscious entrepreneurship, we will give strenght the entrepreneurial body agains the toxic developments, which is auto-immune. In this urgent, fast-paced, and turbulent world, the entrepreneur needs to act but does so under a stressful condition that is engaged as in it is the way to perform, to thrive, to beat a competition. However, these actions should not arise from arbitrary pressures that lead entrepreneurs to ignore the strategic issues of work conduct. 

In other words, we aim a strategy that ceases to be reactive or speed-oriented from the pressures clamoring for results. Thus we will set themselves to avoid resorting to abuses that form a toxic culture centered where the end justifies the means. In such a culture, work dances with the bursts of motivational incentives, while possible signs of an environment detrimental to the work itself and the development of the team's work methodology are silenced.The strategy cannot be reduced to just going with the flow, under the shadow of the world’s accelerated pace. We don’t just want speed, to run for the sake of running. On the contrary, we need to learn as we execute, but leaning about growth both as individuals and as leaders of our organizations. By doing so, we create a learning organization, which is one of the goals of this reflection and opportunity.

Therefore, we bring situations, complications, and reflections that were not designed as recipes, as ready-made solutions to solve the adversities and complexities of the urgent mode. The idea is to strengthen, or to recover, or to keep alive, the entrepreneurial side of the entrepreneur — so that when you are confronted with chaos, and pressure, and a "normal" crazyness at work which is incessantly urgent and rarely seen as toxic and that is actually presented as a price to pay, or the norm, for success. In this sense, Fried and Hansson [^basecampcrazy] invite us to reflect:

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried and Hansson are the founders of Basecamp, a well-known company from Silicon Valley focused on productivity. In the book "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," they argue that it is necessary to work against the industry's toxic instincts and norms that avoids the possibility of managing a company calmly. The expression "It's crazy at work" is used by them to describe a work environment where pressure, such as excessive working hours, and consequences like anxiety, are the norm; and they reject this idea in favor of a calmer and more balanced work environment.

> *"Infelizmente, administrar uma empresa de maneira tranquila não é o modo padrão de gerir uma empresa atualmente. Você precisa ir contra seus instintos por um tempo. Você precisa deixar de lado as normas tóxicas da indústria. Você precisa reconhecer que 'É loucura no trabalho' não está certo."* (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 9, tradução nossa).

With the goal of running less arbitrarily, and creating conditions for conscious actions, entrepreneurs need a more suitable approach to navigate this environment which, without a conscious attitude, proves to be frustrating and exhausting. This approach, above all, begins with something that is internal rather than external, requiring a regulation to the compulsive tendency to constantly seek solutions from the outside. In this sense, this material is not made for a machine. Our most essential reference is valuing the human being as the foundation of the entrepreneurial spirit. In other words, our strategy does not involve selling out the human being as part of the process, discarding our greatest resource. This idea necessarily creates a force, or principle, of self-respect in terms of setting boundaries, but these are justified in order to create well-being for the entrepreneur and the enterprise. This will be our guide for many of our reflections in the three parts to come.

The first part, entitled "Behavioral Urgency," deals with the nature of the entrepreneur, an introspection, as it is useless to discuss the dangers and pitfalls of the urgent world without analyzing habits and behaviors. With this, we enrich a basic framework of principles that will guide us in the accelerated world, against traps.

<!-- 
@meta @Outline
* outline - SCqA kxx - Answer - book's intention - Chapter - Interpersonal 
--> 

The second agenda, "Interpersonal Urgency," is an opportunity for us to reflect on our accelerated communication in the environment where people collaborate. We will look at how the reactive and urgent mode of execution creates pressure for urgent entrepreneurship where actions have become more specialized, with ready-made solutions for everything and where we are always engaged, such as the propensity for entrepreneurs to execute their plans with support from interactive platforms where the protagonists are registered and participating actively. Our reflection does not ask entrepreneurs to stop navigating this world. It asks for a little less precision in execution and more attention to knowing how to guide themselves. This will be an opportunity to reflect on the fact that the world's agenda, even if it is super efficient, is not always compatible with the developing agenda of the entrepreneur and their venture; consequently affecting their goals and dreams.

<!--

The last part is an opportunity to look at the entrepreneur who grows their organization that seeks to develop a sustainable work entity but in an external environment that, as evident everywhere, is connected, urgent, transactional. In this part, the reflection will allow us to consider that we will be growing an organization in an environment that generates pressure and that in all forms of entities are connected and influencing control - through platforms, networks, systems, tools, technologies, and more.

This is a book for everyone who supports entrepreneurs, but particularly for those who care about them and are concerned with their health and their psychological well-being; hence for those who do not think that entrepreneurs are expendable. They are the ones in the arena, and it is a complicated space, full of urgencies and a fast-paced nature, which could prompt them into action and a natural inclination to miss the space for evaluating themselves. Thus, it becomes a book for entrepreneurs themselves as naturally, they will likely be alone at times, and will bear the responsibility to grow themselves, to learn and adapt from experiences. Being open to enlightenment should be acknowledged as part of entrepreneurship. This is especially necessary as entrepreneurs are expected to be in a position to change reality, to free themselves from the normal way things are done, which requires adapting and changing themselves. Entrepreneurial action invites new management.
