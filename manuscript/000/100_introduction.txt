* Abstract - introduction - The need to break the "ongoing conversation" of the corporate world as a train that affects how we work, and also has mechanized the entrepreneurial behavior. Situation is that if try to stop the train, is bad or slow, as opposed to urgent and fast. Complication is that urgent models defines our behaviors. Let's introduce abundance of current platform - with data, and tools and systems - supports mechanized cognition. With limited attention span as culturally accepted (foreword has covered this). With growth systems which enlarges risks. Reasons for moving forward is awareness, conscious entrepreneurship. Part 1,2,3. 
 
### Review SCqA 

* Subject - There is an "ongoing conversation" and an "ongoing train" in the corporate world - one that is fast, urgent, frenetic, or fast paced. Even for entrepreneurs, which are generally required to be generalists, they find themselves onto certain tracks when engage to execute their startups. These tracks show on their ways, like train tracks, calls for urgent and fast paced approach to entrepreneurship; which can prevent them to see how to be effective managers of their entrepreneurial effort.  

* Situation - Culture intro - Entrepreneurs falls in traps as they navigate the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, or the fast-paced culture of entrepreneurship. Ongoing conversation is real. Narratives are real. Such as failing. Well, falling is not even perceived as trap but as part of the equation, to fail and learn, or to learn fast. So, right there, after a fail, no time to reflect. But the situation is that the generalist mindset can run as a mechanized approach to entrepreneurship in the face of the urgent, frenetic, fast-paced, world of entrepreneurship; where being faster is coherent and goes well with good reasons to move fast, such as access to knowlege, role models, stories, methodologies, data, and support systems such as investors and other systems for scaling. 

* Complication - The complication is that a lot of models exist to help, like lean methologies which are strong, but it is undeniable that in the fast-paced setting, or when attention span is limited, and pressure for growth is present, entrepreneurs might be trapped - not by the tools but - by themselves, as they fail to reflect, to judge, to see from above, to shock-absorb their behaviors, to revisit and review how they are managers of entrepreneurship. 

* Key line - Shall we dig more into the parts or briefly make an invitation to the parts and use the key lines as the elements of how we experience things?

* Support - As individuals, we are compelled into specialist mode for all areas, including entrepreneurship. We deny the integrality of us. Part 1. 

* Support - We face the pressure also from peers, as we move into tribes. We have pressure as systems and supporting growth models too. We deny respecting peers. 

* Support - We have mechanized decision with data, tools, and systems. Thinking that they are moving into the next stage. Example, as in foreword we had "shop for solutions", Michael points "out the shelf" actions like "HIring people" check blitzscaling talk. There is no way, time, to keep management open, to think how they are doing, as urgency drives them to deliver, to focus in what. Breaks them from breaking the norm of excitement which breaks them to unfold the "moving across" of Michael.

When someone says "let's go slow", it usually doesn't sound good, especially in the workplace where people collaborate. It sounds like a warning of "danger ahead." Or it might come across as if chastising for something done wrong, a misguided direction. Furthermore, it conveys the idea of underperformance. On the other hand, "let's speed up!" is well-received and has a positive bias. It's easier to hear and accept ideas such as "close the gap," "get there earlier," "sell more," and "deliver faster."

This has become the norm. So normal, in fact, that we no longer notice situations where more speed, more effort, leads us down a slower path. It's not uncommon in the workplace for proposals of "let's speed up" to result in negative outcomes. However, in the hustle and bustle, and before we recognize the situation, another cry emerges like "let's speed up, folks!" This next one, almost perceived as rectifying the unfavorable outcome, comes with a tone of backing the previous process but simultaneously suggests that the effort wasn't enough. It normally comes like "Folks, we didn't do well. Or well, enough. Well, we did great. But we can do more." Then, when more mistakes arise, is it not uncommon to hear a "now is the time!" It's as if someone formally acknowledged that the shit hit the fan, but then a louder moral shout solidifies that "our environment is chaotic!" It serves to justify that what's happening is part of the success equation, the fight for results which is worth it. 

Taking a moment to reflect becomes almost a crime, if anyone even had the time to think. But what always comes, of course, is a light at the end of the tunnel, a voice claiming "this is our chance!" And so we ignore noticing that we are trapped on this fast train, in a rhythmic "push-go, push-hustle, push-drive, push-go!" a coordinated in-loco motive that calls to action, to more fuel, more fire, because up ahead there is a promise of a better station, better state, a chance to celebrate the effort, and even honor the losses on the way, and a promise of distribution of gains. The complication is that a lot of models exist to help, like lean methologies which are strong, but it is undeniable that in the fast-paced setting, or when attention span is limited, and pressure for growth is present, entrepreneurs might be trapped, not by the tools as we can't blame the collective abundance of solutions for any confusion of an apprentice, but by themselves, as they fail to reflect, to judge, to see from above, to shock-absorb their behaviors, to revisit and review how they are managers of entrepreneurship. 

Therefore, I am concerned with what seems to be a productive environment that in fact make us drop respect for the constitients, starting with the founder's team, and which propagates into training ourselves into the misuse of resources - in the name of outcomes - and to lose connection with concerns such as losing focus, distraction, arbitrariness, gambling movements, risk management or conscious entrepreneurship.

#### Expendable the most expensive resource 

Anyone crying out for breathing likely gets an "Eyes of tiger!," not entirely a call to action but a call for more effort. And anyone that speaks out a hint of distress earn themselves a 'whiner' flair on their jacket. Not too big and a little colored or happy, in such a way that resets the critic as a little joke although enough to silence whinning calls. And if, as a whole, the crew speaks of stopping the movement, a managemer critic chimes in and pours enough rain on the parade but just enough before the crew gives up. In other words, the corporate setting carries the duty to maintain the equilibrium, to keep spirits high, high enough to keep the flow. If we zoom out from what happens, it's a language borne of a passive-aggressive culture favoring managers, or actually non-managing managers, who lean heavily on extracting more from human resources. On this train, the human resource essentially becomes the coal. Expenditure is now the manager  coordinates its duty - it is through a narrative of "we can't waste time" or "waste is not an option" that the corporate setting becomes wasteful. And so, in this perceived "highly performant" modern management, after unaccounted losses, that the train approaches the next station, no matter how turbulent was the ride, finds a station that welcomes everyone as heroes, even before a hand it raised. If it is, gets a colored popsicle. It is time for a celebration, takes the moment for any reflective thought, that honors. So they think, "if we've exerted so much energy and burned our resources in the so many attempts, if some of us have been lost along the way, let's then have a moment of silence - we respect our soldiers. Then let's follow by a few hearty hours of celebration. It's the people's feast that takes place, with lambs and sloths and carps and anchovies and orangutans and breakast cereals and fruit and bats and needless to say guacamole and the option to return home a couple hours early. For those who orchestrated the show, up to the station, a promotion is in order, for a couple leaders representing a team of soldiers; comes swiftly as a cost-effective approach to elevate the real heroes, the subordinates. Not only cost effective but it prevents a revolt and at the same time lifts the spirits to keep moving. The train can't lost its momentum, it's fire, them fuel. This situation sadly meshes with the narratives of modern corporate management. Especially when the organization validates the strategy as sound and coherent, then the fast-paced mode goes well as a supporting system for increased efficiency. Althought some organizations are closer or far from this unsweet spot, it is not an incoherent possibility as some of that shows a degree of ethical hue. It's moral, since it ties with a human value that effort makes change. 

In other views, we have a highly productive space, on the one hand, and on the other a system that forgets the being, as if you can pick from so many options of solutions that you may ignore the fact that you are using time picking, selecting from choices, lost in choices, stories, data, and worse - capable of manipulating your narrative. And which can be misleading, not like the entrepreneurial is a conscious machine with an intent, but that the nature or "the algorith" naturally teases our focus to be on capturing outcomes, shopping for solutions, as opposed to looking at our vital structure. And what would be that vital structure? The being, human beings, especially when it's a small boat. Thus, the environment might mislead us into considering we are good decision makers, as we can be picking solutions cheap, but implicitly turn us into being expendable [^editornote_expendable_rambo] constituents. In other words, the productive situation in the modern context of entrepreneurship treats entrepreneurs like expendable soldiers being called for a war. We are moved into becoming deciders among given call to actions in front of a board - it's natural of the ecosystem, when navigated in an urgent way, prompts entrepreneurs into the situation where the ends justifies the means, an outcome-driven nature. Then, when things start to move, and it moves fast indeed, we get into ignoring the vital resource, the most expensive resource, ironically, the constituents, the beings. By ignoring our willpower, our energy, we get used to ignoring the vital element of anyone that join us. We will given them the words, again, like "Eyes of the tiger", we will seek the ends, whatever the means. Ignoring the management of entrepreneurship, right from the start. 

[^editornote_expendable_rambo]: Editor's note. Why the word expendable? This line of truthful thought syncs with a truth given by the character Rambo, check scene of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysnmj2YJPzQ where he reveals a truth that soldiers are thrown for the sake of winning a war. And this, right here, unveils a reality that the book is interested in helping the reader-entrepreneur with which is: more awareness to a journey where the situation induces entrepreneurs to drop accountability such as starting with not respecting themselves, such as their time and mind-body, which influences their whole method for engaging with the context, which promotes them to fail in many ways, create cultures that are toxic, giving up as a result of being frustrated, lacking ethics, missing the view from other players along the way, becoming gamblers, and related characteristics. 

A ilustração acima projeta um ritmo de trabalho acelerado e frenético que tornou-se natural, no mundo do trabalho, no mundo corporativo. Será que isso tem se tornado normal porque as pessoas simplesmente estão ansiosas para terminar o plano que começaram? Por medo de perder o que aparentemente funciona, ou o que já está investido, e confrontar o risco inerente do que é novo e demanda planejamento? Ou, talvez porque colaboradores são, acima de tudo, medidos por eficiência e métricas de resultado associadas ao presente? Ou talvez a aceleração e busca por eficiência vem por pressão natural de um processo de trabalho que é competitivo e naturalmente baseado em comparações. Nessa inclinação, em um ambiente de competição, o desempenho passa a ser um fator de impacto pois queremos mover mais rápido, do que o outro; entregar mais rápido. 

This is the focus area in our book. Reflecting on this acceleration in entrepreneurship and how it impacts our routine precisely at the time we need energy, good ideas, and the conditions for this energy to become value. What stands before us is the prioritization of the startup itself, not exactly the pursuit of a valuable solution for a potential customer, a pursuit where the end justifies the means. As we delve into the issue of modern entrepreneurship, we also touch on the age-old problem; it continues to be about navigation, the journey, the how, more than a problem of speed. The mistake, or "flaw," that entrepreneurs commit has more to do with ingrained anxiety driven by the nature of the culture and environment they are. Andy Grove, in the book "High Output Management," reminds us of an old saying that if you don't know where you're going, any path will take you there. 

#### Mechanization of decision   

Além do que parece ser uma narrativa para acelerar o esforço, o modo de execução acelerado também infiltrou-se no contexto de análise e planejamento da gestão. As coisas não ficaram mais rápidas apenas porque as pessoas correm mais, porque trabalham mais intensivamente, porque gestores coordenam o ritmo frenético porque gostam de um ritmo frenético. O modo rápido é suportado por funções, ou recursos, que estão "prontos" e disponíveis em mãos. No velho oeste americano, uma serra na mão de um carpinteiro era uma peça de trabalho que merecia atenção e cuidado, encontrar a velocidade correta, encontrar o uso correto. Um aprendiz ao considerar a ferramenta iria encontrar um mentor, talvez na forma de mestre, mas que havia um ambiente que de aprendiz. Na realidade moderna do gestor do conhecimento, os dados passaram a ser utilizados como ferramentas, como mecanismos para acelerar decisões. [Tem um artigo do Peter Drucker que diz que tecnologia é trabalho. Talvez seja um fundamento especial que justifica essa quase aberração onde dados tornam-se ferramentas. Por um lado aberração, por outro lado é necessário falar disso porque isso está sendo feito no dia a dia.] O ex-CEO da Intel, Andy Grove, em *Arguing with data* (Argumentando com Dados), alertou [^grovefastdata] há tempos que grandes empresas são doutrinadas pela gestão contemporânea que sugere que as pessoas devem argumentar seus debates com os dados já em mãos (GROVEDATA, p.116).

[^grovefastdata]: No livro de Andy, Only the Paranoid Survive (Apenas o Paranoico Sobrevive), a frase citada em inglês é “A doutrina de gestão contemporânea sugere que você deve abordar qualquer debate e argumento com dados em mãos. É um bom conselho. Com demasiada frequência, as pessoas substituem opiniões por fatos e emoções por análise.” O alerta se aplica à situação que ele chamou de Ponto de Inflecção Estratégico, situações tão adversas e inesperadas que confundem as empresas. A Intel sobreviveu a situações de crise dessa magnitude e mais tarde também se tornou a protagonista. Nessas situações, os dados que antecipam podem ser enganosos. 

Essa forma de operar decisões - com dados - nos provoca para refletir sobre a mecanização da cognição, que vai de encontro com a necessidade de maior eficiência no trabalho. A presença de dados torna-se concreta, nos dá boas razões, diante de uma decisão que precisa ser feita. Dados nos cativam, certamente, porque funcionam tão bem, quando funcionam. Como ferramentas, como uma serra.   

Por outro lado, quando ondas inesperadas aparecem e novos ventos sopram, como as situações adversas à frente das equipes, é quando precisamos de novas soluções já que o que está sendo feito precisa ser reconsiderado. Mas os momentos de incertezas não chegam com uma faixa - momento de incerteza, novos ventos à frente. Acabamos que caímos em armadilhas na sequência do executar. No livro mencionado, *Only the Paranoid Survive*, Andy fala sobre a dificuldade que a Intel passou quando era a maior fabricante de memórias de computadores, qunado a gestão quase falhou em notar sinais invisíveis, os novos ventos. A Intel sobreviveu e lutou contra o que Grove indicou ser uma força 10x. Eles perceberam que precisavam navegar de forma diferente, o que os levou a se afastar da posição de fabricantes de memórias de computador passando a atuar como fabricante de chips, ou processadores, de computador. Hoje conhecemos a Intel como uma das maiores fabricantes de chips de computador. [Talvez precisamos de algo mais aqui e não sei se cabe a história do Innovator's Dilemma.]

[Além disso, Christensen, no livro Innovator's Dilemma (Dilema do Inovador), apresenta cenários de grandes empresas que continuaram a correr impulsionadas por seus dados, em modo rápido, e não conseguiram ver a necessidade de reinventar seus produtos.]

O que acontece no mundo interconectado e turbulento é que os especialistas são constantemente pressionados por soluções "mais rápidas" e modernas para coisas que eles já conhecem. Por que enviar e-mails individuais quando você pode enviar um milhão de e-mails de uma só vez? É como se todas as soluções disponíveis parecessem úteis, eficientes. Além disso, neste oceano turbulento, quando você pede ajuda, não é difícil encontrar uma multidão de marinheiros, especialistas em suas áreas, prontos para executar o que sabem fazer - o lado do especialista. Um programador que codifica mais rápido, um engenheiro que calcula mais rápido. As ferramentas, mais automatizadas. E os dados, agora disponíveis mais cedo e prontos para ajudar na tomada de decisões. Em meio a essa disponibilidade imediata de modelos, é fácil entrar na onda - e vamos encarar - escolher soluções que prometem entregar mais rapidamente, entre as opções, sem reconsiderar a estratégia do processo em sí.  

Mas também é igualmente conveniente continuar no mesmo caminho, justamente porque o ponto de referência externo, de navegação, é ignorado. Neste mundo, onde a velocidade pode acelerar qualquer especialidade, somos levados a pensar que podemos acelerar ainda mais, mesmo que cometamos erros ou peguemos um desvio. Falhar mais rápido e aprender é um tema que faz sentido. No entanto, uma reflexão é necessária e importante, uma vez que chegar mais rápido ao lugar errado não significa apenas atraso, mas também implica o consumo de energia, recursos, força de vontade e motivação.

Nesse mar de soluções prontas, o empreendedor pode participar de um bootcamp, se inscrever em uma incubadora e depois mergulhar em um acelerador. Esses são situações que prometem acelerações e prometem resolver a jornada do empreendedor. O assédio para o modo "apenas faça" ataca também o perfil do empreendedor, que demanda o pensamento generalista, porém agora fica igualmente assediado por soluções especializadas. Em outras palavras, o empreendedor que deveria estar na posição generalista, torna-se puxado para o cockpit da inovação, que oferece opções "plug-and-play" do mundo urgente. 

#### Pressured frames at scale 

O renomado Steve Blank abordou a questão fundamental um o problema, no caso das startups, quando revelou uma visão (Blank, 2014) que teve. Segundo Steve, a ideia precursora do movimento *lean* é que os empreendedores pensam que suas ideias podem ser materializadas como versões pequenas de grandes empresas. Steve diz que "startups não são versões pequenas de grandes empresas", que a diferença entre uma startup e uma empresa estabelecida é que a startup está na fase de descoberta, o que é diferente da grande empresa que já identificou seu papel no mercado e tem um produto validado. Quando as ideias não estão validadas, operar como se fosse uma grande empresa é muito perigoso e arriscado, já que a empresa jovem está em processo de descoberta e tem poucos recursos para apostas. Muito sobre esse assunto (não operar como uma grande empresa e reconhecer a fase de descoberta) existe na literatura de startups e também está presente no mundo das plataformas, metodologias e estruturas de startups.

Mas de fato, essa ideia forte também leva empreendedores para um empreendedorismo reativo, por exemplo quando eles correm para buscar as soluções que estão categorizidadas como "coisas que startups fazem". Então, de forma paradoxal, empreendedores podem também, em seus processos urgentes, fugir do comportamento corporativo e serem atraídos para o comportamento rápido das startups, por exemplos, se verem imersos nos processos lean e até promoverem que estão fazendo lean e de fato estarem vivenciando uma procrastinação [^editornote_procrastination_lean] do processo. 

[^editornote_procrastination_lean]: A further chapter shows the interview with Steve Blank where the talking about lean without doing lean appears as a potential phenomenon.

When in front of the aisles with the goal of making a startup, one can become hungry for the breakfast buffet where you can pick all that you want. When we start, and across the aisles for all phases of growth, the full colored buffet is there, and the crew can always pick more, among all colors and flavors. And worse of all, entrepreneurship rises from a hungry spirit, doesn't it? And worse of all, entrepreneurship resets the crew to accept that digestion problems are just part of the equation. Entrepreneurship calls for growth and growth supports the call to action, to eat more, to shop more. 

Eric Ries has also brought a complication where founders start with lean but appear to drop lean as they get signs of traction, as in they fall into executing in a more traditional way, as soon as possible. A possibility for that behavior might not be only coming from the urge to succeed but also forces of the growth system that appears ahead of anyone willing to make a startup [^editornote_paulgraham_growth] - growth.

[^editornote_paulgraham_growth]: Paul Graham covers both the aspect that startups are for a growth situation but also covers that founders follow instincs such as a willingness to play the game. The through of sorrow of Paul Graham also depicts that startups force their status as political, projections, leading to falling in their own traps, such as to be sad that their projections were not real.

#### The next chapters, its parts 

Com o objetivo de correr menos para qualquer lugar e fazer apostas menores e ações mais conscientes, o empreendedor precisa de uma abordagem mais adequada para navegar nesse ambiente que, caso não tenha uma atitude consciente, se mostrará frustrante mas também exaustivo. Essa abordagem, acima de tudo, começa com algo que está dentro e menos fora, que demanda menos uma tendência moderna e compulsiva por, a todo momento, buscar a solução no externo. Neste sentido, este material não foi feito para uma máquina. Nossa referência mais essencial, um pilar maior, é assumirmos nosso ser humano como a base do nosso ser empreendedor. Em outras palavras, nossa estratégia não envolve vender, ou descartar, nosso ser humano durante o processo, descartar o maior recurso. 

Essa ideia necessariamente cria uma força, ou princípio, de autorespeito, no sentido de limites que geram saídas criativas. Isso será nosso guia para muitas das nossas reflexões nas três partes que virão. Veremos que com base em autorespeito ao ser empreendedor estaremos nos libertando no rumo de um empreendedorismo consciente que pode ser mais imune ao ruído e ambiente turbulanto e interconectado, o ambiente que é normalmente percebido como acelerado. 

Assim, este livro aborda questões empreendedoras de tal maneira que o empreendedor não se torne uma pessoa desviada do que acredita. Esse princípio começa com a permissão de negar ou desistir - não necessariamente embarcar no "trem-bala" apenas porque outros empreendedores o fazem. Não necessariamente entrar na boate porque a batida parece ser a "batida do momento". O maior abuso que o empreendedor pode cometer é quando começa a sacrificar sua identidade, ou confunde-se sua identidade diante do papel que está vivenciando no modo empreendedor.  

No mundo urgente, rápido e turbulento, o empreendedor precisa agir. Entretanto, essas ações não devem surgir com base em pressões sem estratégia, mas em uma estratégia personalizada que se desenvolve durante o processo. A estratégia não pode ser apenas a velocidade e as pressões que clamam por resultados. Isso é particularmente verdadeiro no ambiente de pessoas quando não encontramos ferramentas e somos obrigados a recorrer a abusos que, na verdade, formam uma cultura tóxica centrada em estímulos e foco no presente. Em tal cultura, os jorros de pressão e os gritos são mal interpretados como incentivo motivacional, em vez de sinais de um ambiente prejudicial.

A estratégia não pode se resumir a seguir o fluxo, à sombra do ritmo acelerado do mundo. Não queremos apenas velocidade, correr por correr. Pelo contrário, precisamos aprender enquanto realizamos, para que possamos crescer, tanto nós como os indivíduos que colaboram em nossas empresas. Com isso criamos uma organização de aprendizado, que é um dos objetivos dessa reflexão e oportunidade.

Aqui estão recursos e situações que não foram projetadas como receitas, como soluções prontas para resolver as adversidades. Eles representam uma oportunidade para reflexão. A ideia é fortalecer um lado do seu ser empreendedor, para que você possa enfrentar a pressão padrão - que traz dados que muitas vezes parecem sinais mas que muitas vezes são ruídos que perturbam o processo construtivo, à jornada empreendedora em questão.

Quando confrontados com o caos e a pressão, é comum não reconhecemos que estamos perpetuando um ciclo prejudicial. Na verdade, essa "loucura" no trabalho, urgência incessante, é raramente vista como tóxica. Ao invés disso, é apresentada como uma necessidade ou um preço a pagar pelo sucesso. Nesse sentido, Fried e Hansson [^basecampcrazy] nos convidam para uma reflexão:

> "Infelizmente, administrar uma empresa de maneira tranquila não é o modo padrão de gerir uma empresa atualmente. Você precisa ir contra seus instintos por um tempo. Você precisa deixar de lado as normas tóxicas da indústria. Você precisa reconhecer que 'É loucura no trabalho' não está certo." (Fried & Hansson, 2018, p. 9, tradução nossa).

Na busca de uma abordagem de empreendedorismo mais cosciente, ou honesta, nosso objetivo é permitir que o empreendedor se concentre em uma agenda mais produtiva e saudável; diante da jornada que é difícil e incerta. Com autorepeito e uma visão consciente, os passos do empreendedor se tornam mais produtivos, aumentando as chances para o sucesso, e criando um modo de pensar mais consciente que promove empreendimentos e organizações mais duradouras. 

A primeira parte, intitulada "Urgência Comportamental", trata da natureza do empreendedor, uma introspecção, pois é inútil discutir os perigos e armadilhas do mundo urgente sem analisar hábitos e comportamentos. Com isso, enriquecemos uma estrutura básica de princípios que nos guiará no mundo acelerado, contra armadilhas.

[^basecampcrazy]: Fried e Hansson são os fundadores da Basecamp, uma reconhecida empresa do Vale do Silício focada em produtividade. No livro "It doesn't have to be crazy at work", eles defendem que é preciso trabalhar contra os instintos e normas tóxicas da indústria para administrar uma empresa de forma tranquila. A expressão "É loucura no trabalho" é utilizada por eles para descrever um ambiente de trabalho onde a pressão, como excesso de horas de trabalho, e consequência como a ansiedade, são a norma; e rejeitam essa ideia em prol de um ambiente de trabalho mais calmo e equilibrado.

A segunda agenda, "Urgência Interpessoal", é uma oportunidade para refletirmos sobre nossa comunicação acelerada no ambiente onde as pessoas colaboram. Vamos olhar sobre como o modo de execução reativo e urgente cria uma pressão para um empreendorismo urgente onde ações se tornaram mais especializadas, com soluções prontas para tudo e onde estamos sempre engrenados, como a propensão para empreendedores executarem seus planos com suporte de plataformas interativas onde os protagonistas estão inscritos e participando de forma ativa. Nossa reflexão pede não que empreendedores deixem de navegar nesse mundo. Pede um pouco menos de precisão na execução e mais atenção sobre saber como se guiar. Isso será uma oportunidade de reflexão sobre o fato de que nem sempre a agenda do mundo, mesmo que seja super eficiente, é compatível com a agenda em construção do empreendedor e do seu empreendimento; consequentemente seus objetivos e sonhos.

A última parte é uma oportunidade de olhar o empreendedor que cresce sua organização que busca desenvolver uma entidade de trabalho sustentável mas nesse ambiente urgente. Nesta parte, a reflexão nos permitirá considerar como que a cultura também exerce controle, como ferramentas e tecnologias modernas exercem pressão e nos colocam na posição de subordinados sendo que nem mais sabemos que somos vitimas. Nossa reflexão pede um protagonismo iluminado para nossas organizações, que sugere abordagens para o empreendimento avançar, melhorando a velocidade por meio do desenvolvimento de uma cultura forte. O foco é dado para uma organização que quer curanr o processo, sua cultura e equipe de trabalho. Em nenhum momento o livro sugere que o empreendedor abandone seus princípios, que são a premissa básica do livro e estão enraizados na primeira agenda. Então, vamos lá, vamos lidar, em primeiro lugar, com o Urgência Comportamental.

#### Worth considering final remark? 

Na corrida de resistência do empreendedorismo, quando a névoa é densa, acelerar não é a melhor opção. Para aqueles que o fazem, quando "acelerar" é a estratégia, é melhor desejar-lhes boa sorte, porque uma coisa é garantida - eles entrarão em uma espiral que os levará mais rapidamente a um destino medíocre, consumindo, desgastando e potencialmente levando ao fim não swó da ideia mas do negócio. A busca pelo resultado sem a preocupação com a startup está diretamente ligada a capacidade de aprender que é necessária no processo de empreender. E quando execução sem consciência encontra resultados negativos, temos poucos cartuchos de energia para ativar o mesmo jogo, o que gera confusão, distração, frustração, o que desmotiva. Sim, se estiverem em modo de jogo, alguns deles podem até vencer com velocidade como estratégia. Mas a premissa desse livro não é essa, que acelerar é estratégia, ou que errar rápido e aprender rápido é a estratégia fundamental.
