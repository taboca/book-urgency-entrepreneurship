### Part - October, 18th, reviewed November 3rd, 2023 (* * *) #humble #apprentice #growth

The effect that I want to provoke, to the reader - being them entrepreneurs, managers, practitioners, investors, anyone interested in the startup ecosystem - is not about improving their awareness that the fast-paced world is a world where one can drive fast because of the frames, as in the world of possibilities, from abundance, as framed in a way or another. Although this is part of the situation of entrepreneurship, I want the reader to consider the possiblity that transcendence, or the development of the enlighted entrepreneur, and willingness to do so, becomes a lower priority as the matter of now, the present need, gets in the way, althought it is critically necessary before as growth of startups depends on growth of the self. Although learning and execution is generally recognized by entrepreneurs, urgency leads to learning in retrospect while leadership in entrepreneurship, or conscious entrepreneurship, involves the development of a  humble mindset that sets the entrepreneur as an apprentice that recognizes that what gets you here is not what takes you there. 

## Audience

* Entrepreneurs, managers, practitioners, investors. 

## Context 

* Narrow: Startup - As an team that is created with the intention to grow, as a business, such as to scale. 
* Broad: Supports the development of leaders, and the humble and apprentice aspect of entrepreneurs, or managers. 
* Broader: Supports consciousness for development of the self as growth of self is required in the world. 

## Origin of the book from Blitzscaling and differentiation, or contribution 

* Situation 1 - Blitzscaling - Blitzscaling the course has covered behavioral aspects that supports what it takes to Blitzscale, mainly through the interviews, it is possible to detect from everywhere. Situation 2 - The agenda of Blitzscaling, the growth of Blitzscaling, naturally had positioned the executive team to focus on the main priorities, which seemed to gain a focus on the macro aspects.   

* Complication - When entrepreneurs start their startups, they won't find many behavioral materials, such as which supports a readiness level of them as human beings that generates a good entrepreneur. As they get into the "capsule" for growth, which naturally starts with a pressure for growth, they may lead them into misleading theselves because the reading, or reflective state, is less promoted by the fast-paced environment of modern entrepreneurship linked to how people work, as in industry behaviors, cultural and societal aspects. 

* Question - In other words, Blitzscaling and startup as growth exists. And possibilities for people to make startups also has continues to growth, with the abundance and richness of the modern ecosystem. But would it be the case that the ones passing in the tests, besides all that is being said such as systems and methods, actually display a readiness level in terms of behaviors such as to be consider as people that think through, or conscious entrepreneurs, or humble/infinite learners, among other perceived characteristics? If so, would it be the case that some part of the ones passing the test don't even know of a readiness state as a human being?. And that the others that failed, might also not know that human and behavioral aspects, such as analysis and reflective thinking around anxiety, obsession, instant gratification, following instincts, and the alike, drove them into a path leading to frustration, waste of energy, and failure perceived as real failure? 

* Answer - Although the system of growth responds to that - such as from the point of view of top tier investors that may support the winners that somehow passed tests which in many situations is not known - or that the contest always takes care of itself selecting the best, this book is concerned with the individual in a holistic way, from end to end. Which naturally sets a challenge as through this frame we can't see entrepreneurs as expendable, which naturally sets a a frame for the book where growth of a startup is liked to the growth of self as individuals which forms conscious entrepreneurship, which naturally forces a frame where success has to be adjusted and can't be about capturing the prize on done in ways such as where the end justifies the means. 

* Answer - Since the author started from entrepreneurship, and not philosophy or psychology, the book carries the reader from a world as it seems, through the goggles that it is an urgent world that somehow is too rich, which indeed offers possibilities for startups, which also happens to be chaotic, which happens to be a complication through this view exactly as - by the terms of a narrative of a somehow mechanized world - entrepreneurs are likely pushed into being okay with chaos. By accepting the "train in movement", an urgent train, the book attempts to carry the reader to be okay with establishing a reflective thinking, or reflective tour, so that reflections about behaviors can brought to our attention and a wider context of absctraction is aimed, towards conscious entrepreneurship that respects humans. 

* Parts - The first part focuses on the self, as in to lift the reflective spirit that the unit of work of a startup might start with an individual, that happens to be in a world that influences behavior. In this part, we reflect on: Aspects of use of our "Time"; Aspects of characterization as "Wanterpreneurs" as an element that deserves compassion; Aspects of the world of "Words" and "Narratives" that influences our movements; Aspects of "Spaces", such as platforms that seem to create realities like bundled realities; Aspects of "identity" driven by "Love", or "Fear", and "Emotions"; Aspects of our need to search "Impact" which  happen to set us to miss values that can impact growtn; Aspects of "Running" which has to do with with when we want to perform and how that blinds us of what took us to be productive in the first place; And a reflection about "Success" that demands inner growth and transcendence from the ties of now. 

* Part 2 - Making peace with inductive communication - A reflectiion about the fact that some kind of people may deny communication as they think it's arbitrary or a skill of talented people. We use the work of Barbara Minto, and viewpoint of Michael to come to terms first to respect that communication will affect anyway, for good or bad, and then to set the entrepreneur in a position to assume it is important to become skilled in this context. 

* Part 2 - Expressing gratitude - A reflective exercise that by writing letters of thanks, one may find a reflective elaboration that leads to discoveries and opportunities and not to take things from granted which translates as awareness about collaboration. 

* Part 2 - Breaking Urgency - When things start to move, it is difficult to understand the movements that emerges from feedback, which appears to be right; and more difficult to find space to reflect about these automatic responses that can create risk. Also covers aspects such as "Urgent vs. Important" or like when people kill time for what is important with urgent thoughts like "it gotta be very important to be important" which naturally puts a roadblock as in something important had to come from the side and not from actual work. 

* Part 2 - Animated world - We lift the view of entrepreneurs that interactions are happening with objects, and entities, or resources, such as non-interactive and interactive, as animation is reaching out into everything. As in objects how speak as if they look like people, or talking with people. And the voice, or narratives, they use, provoke us to react. This puts a seed that all around is communicating better, with emotions too, which may lead to distractions to the self and team. 

* Part 2 - Stop Impressing - The origins of impressing are not that wrong. But impressing can hide important things, supress feedback, disconnect from humans and their creativeness, and prevent self enlighment. 

* Part 2 - The flow of pressure - 


## Why the book 

No cerne desde trabalho começou a partir de aprendizado com praticantes, mentores, investidores e empreendedores que inspiram e influenciaram muito sobre o modelo das startups, como Steve Blank, Eric Ries, Paul Graham, Michael Dearing, Reid Hoffman, Brian Chesky e muitos outros que servem de inspiração para este autor e para muitos outros. No entanto, o olhar estabelecido reconhece os momentos em que esses mesmos ícones e modelos do empreendedorismo estão nos alertando sobre a importância da parte comportamental.

Essa abordagem procura valorizar não apenas os aspectos técnicos e metodológicos do empreendedorismo, mas também enfatizar a necessidade de desenvolver uma inclinação para compreensão de si mesmo e a capacidade de lidar com as pressões e desafios emocionais que surgem ao longo da jornada empreendedora. Afinal, são essas habilidades comportamentais que podem fazer a diferença entre o sucesso duradouro e o fracasso.

Nas três partes do livro - "Urgência Comportamental", "Urgência Interpessoal" e "Urgência Sistemática, Sistêmica ou Organizacional" - fazemos um convite para você vivenciar facetas do empreendedorismo, fenômenos e características comportamentais em um ambiente que ficou automático, para não dizer pasteurizado, com atitudes, hábitos, ou comportamentos, sejam estes naturais do ser humano ou dos grupos ou dos métodos ou do ecossistema ou cultura, que gera um empreendedorismo que fica obcecado pela velocidade e pela gratificação, ou resultados de impacto. Nosso objetivo não é rejeitar as oportunidades do novo mundo empreendedor que oferece muito mais do que antes, possibilidades, em um mar de abundância onde tecnologia, metologodias, ferramentas, sistemas, redes, de fato promete aceleração, crescimento, sucesso e possibilidades; mas sim encontrar um equilíbrio entre utilizá-las de forma eficaz e permanecer fiel a valores de forma que o empreendedorismo consciente seja o caminho para menos desperdício, de tempo, de foco, recursos, e do que é mais vital, energia do empreendedor. 

Acreditamos que uma abordagem consciente e medida ao empreendedorismo pode levar a empreendimentos mais sustentáveis e a uma cultura de trabalho mais saudável. Isso capacita os empreendedores a abraçar a incerteza, aprender com os fracassos e crescer como indivíduos e organizações.

"Desacelere sua Startup" oferece um roteiro reflexivo, não um guia de passos, que permite uma navegação e introspecção pelas águas caóticas do empreendedorismo que se passam como normal, assim despertando autoconsciência que não desrespeita o empreendedor e quem gera o empreendedorismo, o ser humano. Convidamos os empreendedores a traçar seu próprio caminho, valorizando o progresso em vez da perfeição, a paciência em vez da pressa e o sucesso a longo prazo ao contrário da busca por vitórias como status. Portanto, se você está pronto para desafiar o status quo e adotar uma nova perspectiva sobre o empreendedorismo - uma que valoriza o bem-estar, a clareza e o crescimento genuíno. 


### Part - October #Supporters #SElfSupport

This is a book for everyone that supports entrepreneurs, but the ones that cares about them and are concerned with their helath and their psycholgical health; therefore the ones that do not think that antrepreneurs are expendable. \As they are the ones in the arena, and it is a complicated space, of uggencies and a fast-paced nature, which would prompt them into action and a natural inclinetion to miss the space of evaluating ethemselves, thus it becomes a book for entrepreneurs themselves as naturally they will likely be alone at times, and will carry the responsiblity to the grow themselves to lean and adap from experiences. Bring open to enlightment should be acknowledged as part of entrepreneurship. This is especially necessary as entrepreneurs are expetec in a position to change the reality, to free themselves from the normal way things are done, which requires adapting and changing themselves. Entrepreneurial action invites new management. 

### Part - Taken from the end of the introduction, Oct 26th

Na corrida de resistência do empreendedorismo, quando a névoa é densa, acelerar não é a melhor opção. Para aqueles que o fazem, quando "acelerar" é a estratégia, é melhor desejar-lhes boa sorte, porque uma coisa é garantida - eles entrarão em uma espiral que os levará mais rapidamente a um destino medíocre, consumindo, desgastando e potencialmente levando ao fim não swó da ideia mas do negócio. A busca pelo resultado sem a preocupação com a startup está diretamente ligada a capacidade de aprender que é necessária no processo de empreender. E quando execução sem consciência encontra resultados negativos, temos poucos cartuchos de energia para ativar o mesmo jogo, o que gera confusão, distração, frustração, o que desmotiva. Sim, se estiverem em modo de jogo, alguns deles podem até vencer com velocidade como estratégia. Mas a premissa desse livro não é essa, que acelerar é estratégia, ou que errar rápido e aprender rápido é a estratégia fundamental. 

### Part     

This book supports entrepreneurs in the challenging world of making a startup; it explores the discussions about the challenges and complexities of entrepreneurship; but also holds the subject of personal development. When startup growth is the leading aspect, it might be out of the equation the situation of revising the entrepreneurial act. For example, lean suggests the forward path, but does not deal much with the personal implications and reflections of what happens to the team when it is time to pivot, or, for example, how emotions and the human beings can affect the experiments. This material attempts to tackle that area. 

### Part 

This is a book for entrepreneurs, especifically for the ones interested in launching business for the long run and wishing for themselves to be around. This situation makes the challenge bigger, as it is not uncommon for us to think of becoming entrepreneurs to solve a problem - such as when the end justifies the means. Although the outcome, such as a lasting startup, requires the spirit of an entrepreneur and the generalist role, our focus is on the entrepreneur as the key, to maintain its health. Therefore, it is my intent to think of you as one that should be around, even if you fail in the present project. That constraint should apparently narrow a line of conduct, one that requires the recognotion of a conscious entrepreneurship, that starts with repect for the human being that gives maintains the entrepreneur role. Not the other way around. This idea, or principle, will guide us in the chapters ahead.
