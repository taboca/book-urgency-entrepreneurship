## Review 

* ( ) @vanessa - asked to check why so many examples of machines in the exposition. 
* ( ) @vanessa - asked about the new prisons, or need for freedom, that came after the industrial revolution. Actually, on page 9, "inundação de eventos,.." has the core of the idea which may likely be brought sooner to the reader. In other words, the pages 7-9 are doing, really, what service?

This is a book for entrepreneurs, especifically for the ones interested in launching business for the long run and wishing for themselves to be around. This situation makes the challenge bigger, as it is not uncommon us to think of becoming entrepreneurs as a solution to a problem. Although the outcome, such as a lasting startup, requires the spirit of an entrepreneur, our focus is on the entrepreneur as the key. As my goal is to think of you as being around, even if you fail in the next project, we narrow our line of conduct towards recognizing conscious entrepreneurship, that at all times respects the entrepreneur. This idea, or principle, will guide us, the chapters ahead of us. 

If launching a startup, and making a lasting company, is challenging, then it is even more challenging to do that in a way that you are to respect for the human beings, you and all the constituents from colleagues, investors, partners, and customers. 

But the very reason that motivated me to write wasn't that constraint, really. For me, although I had discovered that through respect, starting with the self, was the only way; the motivation was about establishing a line of conduct to protect us from a major enemy on our way and a reason for yet another call to action - Slow Down Startup - that is the pace. 
What bring us together starts with the recognition that entrepreneurs are pressured to be agile, as in "more agile," or that the ecosytem of entrepreneurship is not immune to the frantic pace we live in, a pace that prompt us into doing a reactionary entrepreneurship, as if we are machines only responding to events. 

If you are an entrepreneur - whether a newbie with a startup, a seasoned pro running a corporation, or someone carving their own path in life - you likely find yourself in a whirlwind which we don't see apparently any problem. How could we when we are so hyperconnected with access to even more information? Now we have more tools, more methods, more interactions, including access to support networks like accelerators, investors, and most importantly, access to information through the internet and social media that enable low-cost interactions, whether it's for learning, receiving mentor support, connecting with partners, meeting investors, joining accelerators, participating in clubs or support groups, or even getting to know and interacting with potential customers. In other words, the hyperconnected environment is a vast and rich ocean that promises much. 

This optimistic environment promises acceleration, even more than results, for entrepreneurial projects and our lives. In this connected and interactive setting, entrepreneurs are empowered to swiftly navigate towards their goals. We are not only empowered with a story that is coherent but also equipped with tool that truly means better chances - processes, methods, and the interconnected world. Today, the cost of seeking motivation from networks seems quite low, for instance as we can network and be thrilled with stories that enlighten our entrepreneurial spirit. On the other hand, consider the tools, such as methodologies that are proven to advance collaboration. Similarly, we are also empowered to navigate through support networks, with interactive systems where too many roles are connected, such as potential customers, investors, mentors, practitioners, cofounders, partners. Althought these elements means potential, I personally feel that this highly productive space seems to forget the being, as if the essential beings are expendable [^editornote_expendable_rambo]. In other words, the productive situation in the modern context of entrepreneurship treats entrepreneurs like expendable soldiers being called for a major war. But is there a machine, such as a conscious machine, misleading them to act like that? No, not exactly. But nevertheless the ecosystem, when navigated in an urgent way, prompts entrepreneurs into the situation where the ends justifies the means, such as to treat resources like the situation of when one is invited to a party but in the face of not showing up, or if they fail, it does not really matter. 

[^editornote_expendable_rambo]: Editor's note. Why the word expendable? This line of truthful thought syncs with a truth given by the character Rambo, check scene of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysnmj2YJPzQ where he reveals a truth that soldiers are thrown for the sake of winning a war. And this, right here, unveils a reality that the book is interested in helping the reader-entrepreneur with which is: more awareness to a journey where the situation induces entrepreneurs to drop accountability such as starting with not respecting themselves, such as their time and mind-body, which influences their whole method for engaging with the context, which promotes them to fail in many ways, create cultures that are toxic, giving up as a result of being frustrated, lacking ethics, missing the view from other players along the way, becoming gamblers, and related characteristics. 

The productive environment might in fact also accelerate towards misuse of resources, lost of focus, distraction, reaching into a state of frustration and not only the premature end of the journey but inability to learn and and understand entrepreneurship. The overarching theme of ours is productivity for the entrepreneur and their act of entrepreneurship; which naturally, in the case of startups, involves learning, which naturally comes before productivity in terms of the processes executed by teams. In this regard, Peter Drucker, in The Practice of Management, brings forward a management thought that can guide us in organizing the process:

> *"Finally, productivity is vitally affected by organization structure and by the balance between the various activities within the business. If, for lack of clear organization, managers waste their time trying to find out what they are supposed to do rather than doing it, the company's scarcest resource is being wasted. "* (Drucker, 1986, p. 45)

Peter Drucker's perspective prompts us to consider the complications along the way when dealing with a startup. If I don't know how to proceed and begin trying to figure out what to do, I'm not being productive. On the other hand, given the various opportunities to progress, I feel inclined to produce even if it means learning from mistakes or, as they say, failing fast to learn. To some extent, this seems valid or even productive if resources were abundant. However, this approach, which depends on luck and excessive energy, doesn't provide any organization from the outset.

The essence of Drucker's thought carries elements to aid us. The first is recognizing that resources, like you and your colleagues, are to be considered a top priority. And that they are limited, and scarse. With that in mind, we can determine a code of conduct, that we are not gambling with these resources. In other words, the top priority goes to the people involved, which includes their mental and physical well-being. 

Another element is the need for clear organization. If we consider this aspect crucial and, at the same time, acknowledge that entrepreneurs don't have a clear roadmap on how to proceed (which is natural in the innovation process,) we're compelled to accept that organizing the process starts with the initiative to reflect on the act of entrepreneurship and the activities of entrepreneurship. In other words, we become concerned with "the balance between the various activities." 

Starting from this point, we can elaborate on the call to "slow down your startup" as a plea for responsible action, especially in light of the acceleration potential that has become the standard. It all begins with a brief pause to reflect. The moment of reading this might be a good pause for reflection. This inclination has consequences, such as the need for courage to allocate time for these reflections. We'll proceed in this direction, so if you're not inclined to set aside time for reflection, this might not be the right book for you. This path will lead us to understand the role of the entrepreneur that encompasses entrepreneurial management. The role of the entrepreneur will logically change as the startup progresses into a complex organization. But even then, this essence doesn't change. This is a generalist essence, capable of balancing activities, providing shock absorbers [^editornote_shockabsorbers_michael] against the forward and rapid motion that's a trend in the startup environment. Of course, we're not aiming to slow down for the sake of slowing down; but to ensure value is preserved in the long run. This means valuing the human being who coordinates the work.

[^editornote_shockabsorbers_michael]: Editor note - Michael Dearing, of Harrison Metal, values the idea that entrepreneurs, due to their behaviors, enters into modes of cognition (through execution) that might lead them into bad situations. https://medium.com/@mcgd/the-cognitive-distortions-of-founders-8e96c1edf60b. The idea of shock absorbers in itself, projects ethics for a conscious entrepreneurship, establishing external eyes. 

In this regard, our goal starts by recognizing that the environment of modern entrepreneurship has changed, empowering us for action and guiding us at every turn. This moment of reflection is also an invitation to observe and interpret how we respond to this environment, like when we operate on autopilot. Our quest is for a more mindful way to approach our entrepreneurial ventures. Thus, we aim to proceed with greater awareness in one of the processes that most requires reflection and conscious thought - entrepreneurship. Precisely because entrepreneurs deserve it, as it's up to them to craft a better future.

Before we dive into the introduction, I invite you to reflect briefly on when the accelerated pace of the world began and how this acceleration started changing our way of thinking and acting in the world. I ask you to transport ourselves to November 10, 1876. On this date, the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, activated [^editornote_check_activated] the massive Corliss engine during the inauguration of the centennial exhibition of the United States' independence in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. This milestone symbolizes the onset of the era we now live in, an era where things became faster. The engine, named the Corliss Centennial Engine, became the icon of the exhibition. Standing 14 meters tall and boasting a power of 1400 hp, it was responsible for powering the entire exhibition setup, which encompassed more than 200 buildings spread over 5 km in length. (Wikipedia, 2019)

[^editornote_check_activated]: Editor note: Check the word "activated" from the book of Maury Klein, The Power Makers. 

![Illustration of the Corliss Engine, public domain.](images/100/CentennialEngine.png)

According to historian Maury Klein (2008), the exhibition showcased all the modern wonders of the mechanization of the industrial revolution: machines that prepared molds for printing machines, sewing machines, telegraph devices, locomotives, automatic saws, belt presses, winches, scales, excavators, drilling machines, giant sugarcane mills, cotton presses, stone-crushing machines, diamond drills, stone cutters, various tools, agricultural equipment, carriages, tile and brick-making machines, bookbinding machines, paper-making machines, cardboard, machines for making threads, cables, screws, car wheels, train wheels, and so much more. Machines.

These elements, fruits of human work and collaboration, many at the time materialized as mechanical solutions, were at the epicenter of a shift that was altering the economic order, advancing the destruction of previous economic models, and launching new work platforms - new economic systems and conditions for future revolutions.

In other words, the centennial exhibition is the celebration of a historic moment that promised a faster-paced world. Interactions between people would become more dynamic, more active. It's impossible to think about the industrial revolution without recognizing the parallel history, the previous historical context that involves the end of slavery: The rising new economic order consisted of technological innovation that created new rules of labor force and more freedoms; defining a new economy. In the context of this new world, the revolution came from the northern United States; while at the same time, there were regions, especially in the southern United States, where the old economic order based on slavery persisted. These two worlds were on a collision course; and the industrial revolution defined the economic context that accelerated the destruction of the old system based on slavery and the emergence of a new system based on freedom and innovation. This new pace, a new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come.

[^footnote_creativedestruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development.

To better illustrate the visualization of the new order, consider the flour mill created by American inventor Oliver Evans in 1790. The illustration of Evans' automatic mill [^footnote_oliverevans_mill] showcases the deliberate intent to remove human labor. The combination of various solutions by Evans eliminated numerous hours of human work and reduced the risk of contamination.

![Evan's design for the automated flour mill](images/100/Oliver_Evans_-_Automated_mill.jpg)

[^footnote_oliverevans_mill]: The illustration of Evans' automatic mill, which is in the public domain, was made by James Poupard and documented in the work titled "The Young Mill-Wright & Miller's Guide."

This tsunami of events, entrepreneurial order, born from the process of Creative Destruction, broke the rules of the "previous game" but at the same time established new rules, and a new economic and social order. And with that, room is being made for the next cycle. Therefore, what was once an act of liberation – the dismantling of a system based on slavery – has brought us back to the future, in front of a new order, with different challenges that prevents, or provokes, entrepreneurs from making the world a better place. 
Challenges that prevents and conversely the opportunity. Therefore, if we look at  entrepreneurship from the lenses of creative destruction, we recognize that revolutions of any system, rewrites, or, rebundle, our platforms, which enables a reality that might provoke us to fix, thus unveiling opportunities.

Starting from a macro perspective of a world that needs help, we can think about the rise in diseases linked to diet, a less healthy lifestyle, increased stress, destruction of nature, among other factors.

On the aspect of connectedness, consider the contrast of a visitor of the 1876 exhibition, where an entire week was needed to fully appreciate it and where only the 10 million who could physically travel to Philadelphia were able to see firsthand the accelerated pace of the new world. Today, with large exhibitions extinct, people are bombarded with #hashtags in the corridors of their social media through "smart phones." The peculiar irony is that we are literally walking through corridors of an exhibition, only this one is continuous and never stops. Today we can find ourselves immersed in a surreal abundance of images, stories, and projections, where everything captivates us after a sensational narrative, not to say visceral. But unlike the impactful experience of that exhibition, which provoked deep reflection about our future, our modern 'exhibition' lacks utility not because the topics aren't amazing. Much of what arises every second is incredible and promising. However, in today's overexposure, we are pulled to jump from section to section, page to page, message to message, too quickly and without time to digest.

In other words, in the turbulence of our hyperconnected world, we become less prone to deep reflections as we compelled to experience things superficially. In this context, journalist Johann Hari, in "Stolen Focus," challenges us to reflect on how the overexposure to information generally reduces our attention: According to a study cited in the book, and published in the journal Nature (Hari, p.39-40, 2023), we can understand that social media contributes to decreased attention the more we are exposed to larger amounts of content. In other words, we might initially blame social media, but in doing so, we are blaming the internet, the telecommunications revolution, the telegraph, and the various means of transport that delivered letters.

In this context, our focus shifts to the entrepreneurs of the modern era. We, as entrepreneurs, who strive to change the world and our lives, recognize the complexities of navigating a stormy sea. But like any environment that needs to change, we don't have time to adjust our routine. We are bound to the pace of acceleration, to the urgent drumbeat, the pressure of speed. We are pushed to decide, to move forward.

Consider, for example, how we are bombarded by a torrent of information, we are immersed in constant overexposure that submerges us in a sea of choices. Systems and networks shape behaviors on a large scale and pressure us to decide, with data, with what we think as "good reasons," empowering us to the next step. In this environment, entrepreneurs might see themselves as protagonists, empowered to execute faster with a feeling of certainty to an iminent success; 

But the dive into the situation we live show the projections of the order - as it seems - at all levels, such as management levels, where the management of entrepreneurship is not out of the forces. Thus, how we act and behave is always a symptom of bring trapped, or victim of the accelerated environment, that not only might suck their project's potential but their energy. The ranges of what can go on with the too fast mover goes from wasting resources to just launching things that are not useful on top of existing platforms without reconsidering that a lot of what is out there is a created reality in the first place.  

In this regard, our goal is to assist the entrepreneurial navigation in this urgent world. We aim to support the entrepreneurial role found in anyone who is open to reflection and to organizing their understanding of navigation, organization, productivity, and the pursuit of success and innovation.

This moment of reflection becomes somewhat urgent because the act of entrepreneurship starts with motivation but generates the potential for action towards innovation. I am grateful that you are engaging with this material, as the articles gathered here promote conscious entrepreneurship in this era of urgencies and pitfalls that besiege the act of embarking on entrepreneurial ventures. This brief pause is for the entrepreneur to become a better protagonist and less a victim of the world's pressing agendas. In this sense, it provides support so that we can navigate towards our dreams without inadvertently becoming victims of the accelerated environment of entrepreneurship, which can be cruel and devastating.

But why a book geared towards entrepreneurs? First, because we are all entrepreneurs, even if we're just navigating our own lives. Second, entrepreneurs who strive to better the world are the ones genuinely in need to improve entrepreneurship itself. In other words, the impact of entrepreneurship feeds back into a more appropriate approach to both entrepreneurship and management. This book, for instance, arose from my learning experiences rooted in the work of individuals - such as managers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners - who inspired me as they champion a more conscious form of entrepreneurship. Thus, this book is a culmination of lessons learned, but it also stands as an accessible resource, an organized body of knowledge, spurring debate. Even though it might be finalized in editions, it remains fluid in terms of knowledge and inspiration in a broader discussion. Third, according to Maslow (1998, p.232), entrepreneurs warrant attention because they play key roles in societies:

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly Entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)

Maslow's message reinforces a perspective that helps us identify the role of the entrepreneur, a role that transcends any specialist role. Therefore, entrepreneurship is way of conduct that trancends our specialist identities and acknowledges the need for continuous learning, an essential element for planning any project involving innovation. Let's embark on our journey, which begins with introspection for navigating our connected, fast-paced world.
