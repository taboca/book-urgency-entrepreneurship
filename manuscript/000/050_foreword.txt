* scqa - Pitch - what can be opportunity can be a distracting trap. abundance of models. We need to lift the being, above the entrepreneur ability, true spirit that breaks the norms. Sadly the norm for generalist is confusing. Motivation for the book is that realization. The very best of Blitzscaling seemed to be best in being human beings. 

* Subject - v0.3 - The situation of entreprepreneurship may suggest that anything can be done. With lots of solutions to advance. These are in the face of modern entrepreneurship that is pulled to be fast. The reality of the world after many cycles of creative destruction, platforms. The new ecomomic order may be offering abudances and opportunity but also opportunity to be lost or to navigate on top of existing "models" and losing connection with inner human values, losing opportunity to innovate, and also break norms of how entrepreneurship happens. 

* scqa - situation - Platforms for entrepreneurship, created opportunity for growth from using abundance of supportinng systems. But also one can be distracted to engage with cheap decisions, oriented to outcome, ignore impact in conscious entrepreneurship. 
* scqa - complication - If so many things can be solved, why the platorm for entrepreneurship could be also a problem, we can be locked? As it became industrialized. 
* scqa - QA - We can be shoppers? Can we solve? Especially as it seems small, fast boat, we are being teased to ignore conscious entrepreneurship. 
* scqa - key lines - COnscious about risk nature, such as respect for time, is a must; but the motivation came from the frames, as all of us might be into an "ongoing conversation". Why?
* scqa - kl - Respect the bundle, first. To respect the frame. The platforms formation, and creative destruction. How world bundles and unbundles. 
* scqa - kl - We can be trapped  into abudance of shopping solutions, creating narratives, highly productive appearance misleading conscious entrepreneurship. What Marcio saw, the "ongoing". 
* scqa - kl - Enlighted management, Maslow, Drucker. What Marcio saw later, discovery, respect. 
 
## Review 

* (x) @vanessa - asked to check why so many examples of machines in the exposition. 
* ( ) @vanessa - asked about the new prisons, or need for freedom, that came after the industrial revolution. Actually, on page 9, "inundação de eventos,.." has the core of the idea which may likely be brought sooner to the reader. In other words, the pages 7-9 are doing, really, what service?

This is a book for entrepreneurs, especifically for the ones interested in launching business for the long run and wishing for themselves to be around. This situation makes the challenge bigger, as it is not uncommon for us to think of becoming entrepreneurs to solve a problem - such as when the end justifies the means. Although the outcome, such as a lasting startup, requires the spirit of an entrepreneur and the generalist role, our focus is on the entrepreneur as the key, to maintain its health. Therefore, it is my intent to think of you as one that should be around, even if you fail in the present project. That constraint should apparently narrow a line of conduct, one that requires the recognotion of a conscious entrepreneurship, that starts with repect for the human being that gives maintains the entrepreneur role. Not the other way around. This idea, or principle, will guide us in the chapters ahead. 

If you are an entrepreneur - whether a newbie with in your first startup, more seasoned leading a startup project within a larger corporation, or someone carving your life - you likely find yourself in a whirlwind which we don't see apparently any problem. How could we, when we are so hyperconnected with access to even more information? Now we have more tools, more methods, more interactions, including access to support networks like accelerators, investors, and most importantly, access to information through the internet and social media that enable low-cost interactions, whether it's for learning, receiving mentor support, connecting with partners, meeting investors, joining accelerators, participating in clubs or support groups, or even getting to know and interacting with potential customers. In other words, the hyperconnected environment is a vast and rich ocean that promises much. This optimistic environment, that promises acceleration, that promises results, for entrepreneurial projects and our lives. In this connected and interactive setting, entrepreneurs are empowered to swiftly navigate towards their goals. We are not only empowered by so many stories that are brithly coherent but also equipped with so many tools that can be verified as proven such as popular startup methodologies. Consider, for example, the cost for acessing motivation from networks, for instance as we can network and be thrilled with stories that enlighten our entrepreneurial spirit. On the other hand, consider the tools, such as methodologies that are proven to advance collaboration. Beyond motivation and processes, consider how we are empowered to advance the actual startup using networks of support - the interactive systems where we can get in touch with potential customers, investors, mentors, practitioners, cofounders, partners, and more. 

In the realm of entrepreneurs, the problem is that this urgent, accelerated, and high-pressure mode, frames their present. Now, just like experts, entrepreneurs make accelerated decisions, even when they are starting - in the understanding phase when ideas are still forming - along with the discovery process, trying to find the value in their team, for their product, for serving needs of customers, seeking investors, etc. But how would this be a problem? It isn't, or at least it does not appear to be, as a lot of good solutions, or product-like solutions, are cheaply available via networks with all sorts of products where many are are approved by the regulating community, are quality solutions. The problem is precisely that in the pressure to undertake there arises the pressure for decision which stifles the design thinking for the management of entrepreneurship. This leads to entrepreneurs to fall in traps as they navigate the ecosystem of entrepreneurship and the fast-paced culture of entrepreneurship. Well, falling is not even perceived as trap but as part of the equation, to fail and learn, or to learn fast. So, right there, after a fail, there is time to reflect. 

Our work for reflective thinking is out at the same time our navigation with soft data is higher. Strategy, especially for entrepreneurial effort, finds no time. Therefore, I am concerned with what seems to be a productive environment that in fact make us drop respect for the constitients, starting with the founder's team, and which propagates into training ourselves into the misuse of resources - in the name of outcomes - and to lose connection with concerns such as losing focus, distraction, arbitrariness, gambling movements, risk management or conscious entrepreneurship. The price to pay is generally not seen - as there are not many stories of the many that gave up - but are generally related to confusion, lack of organization, frustration, willpower loss, impacting the premature end of a journey, or a diying slow journey, inability to learn. 

The overarching theme of ours becomes then the subject of productivity for the entrepreneur and their act of entrepreneurship; which naturally, in the case of startups, involves learning, which naturally comes before productivity in terms of the processes executed by teams. In this regard, Peter Drucker, in The Practice of Management, brings forward a management thought that can guide us in organizing the process:

> *"Finally, productivity is vitally affected by organization structure and by the balance between the various activities within the business. If, for lack of clear organization, managers waste their time trying to find out what they are supposed to do rather than doing it, the company's scarcest resource is being wasted. "* (Drucker, 1986, p. 45)

Peter Drucker's perspective prompts us to consider the complications along the way when dealing with a startup. If I don't know how to proceed and begin trying to figure out what to do, I'm not being productive. On the other hand, given the various opportunities to progress, I feel inclined to produce even if it means learning from mistakes or, as they say, failing fast to learn. To some extent, this seems valid or even productive if resources were abundant. However, this approach, which depends on luck and excessive energy, doesn't provide any organization from the outset. The essence of Drucker's thought carries elements to us. The first is recognizing that resources, like you and your colleagues, are to be considered a top priority. And that they are limited, and scarse. With that in mind, we can determine a code of conduct, that we are not gambling with these resources. In other words, the top priority goes to the people involved, which includes their time, their mental health, and their well-being. 

Another element is the need for clear organization. If we consider this aspect crucial and, at the same time, acknowledge that entrepreneurs don't have a clear roadmap on how to proceed (which is natural in the innovation process,) we're compelled to accept that organizing the process starts with the initiative to reflect on the act of entrepreneurship and the activities of entrepreneurship. In other words, we become concerned with "the balance between the various activities." 

In this regard, our goal starts by recognizing that the environment of modern entrepreneurship has changed, empowering us for action and guiding us in many ways. This moment of reflection is also an invitation to observe and interpret how we respond to this environment, like when we operate on autopilot. Our quest is for a more mindful way to approach our entrepreneurial ventures. Thus, we aim to proceed with greater awareness in one of the processes that most requires reflection and conscious thought - entrepreneurship. Precisely because entrepreneurs deserve it, as it's up to them to craft a better future.

Before we move on, I invite you to reflect on when the accelerated pace of the world began and how this acceleration started changing our way of thinking and acting in the world. I ask you to transport ourselves to November 10, 1876. On this date, the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, activated [^editornote_check_activated] the massive Corliss engine during the inauguration of the centennial exhibition of the United States' independence in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. This milestone symbolizes the onset of the era we now live in, an era where things became faster. The engine, named the Corliss Centennial Engine, became the icon of the exhibition. Standing 14 meters tall and boasting a power of 1400 hp, it was responsible for powering the entire exhibition setup, which encompassed more than 200 buildings spread over 5 km in length. (Wikipedia, 2019)

[^editornote_check_activated]: Editor note: Check the word "activated" from the book of Maury Klein, The Power Makers. 

![Illustration of the Corliss Engine, public domain.](images/100/CentennialEngine.png)

According to historian Maury Klein (2008), the exhibition showcased all the modern wonders of the mechanization of the industrial revolution: machines that prepared molds for printing machines, sewing machines, telegraph devices, locomotives, automatic saws, belt presses, winches, scales, excavators, drilling machines, giant sugarcane mills, cotton presses, stone-crushing machines, diamond drills, stone cutters, various tools, agricultural equipment, carriages, tile and brick-making machines, bookbinding machines, paper-making machines, cardboard, machines for making threads, cables, screws, car wheels, train wheels, and so much more. Machines. I know, it might seem too much to name 26 examples - that now seem antiquated - instead of focusing on big numbers, such as 200 buildings, or the 14 meters steam engine, or the 5 kilometers lenght of the exhibition, or the 10 million visitors, or the 7 days time which one would take to visit the whole exhibition. A bit antiquated for us but nevertheless amusing in size and impact, especially for the ones who experienced the exposition and had a chance to see revolutionary solutions in many sorts of fields as all of these things were new. These elements, fruits of human work and collaboration, many at the time materialized as mechanical solutions, were at the epicenter movement of the economic order, advanced the destruction of a prior economic order, and launching new work platforms - new economic systems and conditions for future revolutions.

In other words, the centennial exhibition is the celebration of a historic moment that promised a faster-paced world. Interactions between people would become more dynamic, more active. It's impossible to think about the industrial revolution without recognizing the parallel history, the previous historical context that involves the end of slavery: The rising new economic order consisted of technological innovation that created new rules of labor force and more freedoms; defining a new economy. In the context of this new world, the revolution came from the northern United States; while at the same time, there were regions, especially in the southern United States, where the old economic order based on slavery persisted. These two worlds were on a collision course; and the industrial revolution defined the economic context that accelerated the destruction of the old system based on slavery and the emergence of a new system based on freedom and innovation. This new pace, a new order, which changed the rules of work and the economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^footnote_creativedestruction]. We have others that would come later, such as the revolution brought about by the advancement of electrical energy, telecommunications, and others yet to come.

[^footnote_creativedestruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the transformative process accompanying radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations lead to the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development.

To better illustrate the visualization of the new order, consider the flour mill created by American inventor Oliver Evans in 1790. The illustration of Evans' automatic mill [^footnote_oliverevans_mill] showcases the deliberate intent to remove human labor. The combination of various solutions by Evans eliminated numerous hours of human work and reduced the risk of contamination.

![Evan's design for the automated flour mill](images/100/Oliver_Evans_-_Automated_mill.jpg)

[^footnote_oliverevans_mill]: The illustration of Evans' automatic mill, which is in the public domain, was made by James Poupard and documented in the work titled "The Young Mill-Wright & Miller's Guide."

#### Bundled reality 

This tsunami of events, entrepreneurial order, born from the process of Creative Destruction, broke the rules of the "previous game" but at the same time established new rules, and a new economic and social order. And with that, room is being made for the next cycle. Therefore, what was once an act of liberation – the dismantling of a system based on slavery – has brought us back to the future, in front of a new order, with different challenges that prevents, or provokes, entrepreneurs from making the world a better place.  Challenges that prevents and conversely the opportunity. Therefore, if we look at  entrepreneurship from the lenses of creative destruction, we recognize that revolutions of any system, rewrites, or, rebundle, our platforms, which enables a reality that might provoke us to fix, thus unveiling opportunities. Starting from a macro perspective of a world that needs help, we can think about the rise in diseases linked to diet, a less healthy lifestyle, increased stress, destruction of nature, among other factors.

On the aspect of connectedness, consider the contrast of a visitor of the 1876 exhibition, where an entire week was needed to fully appreciate it and where only the 10 million who could physically travel to Philadelphia were able to see firsthand the accelerated pace of the new world. Today, with large exhibitions extinct, people are bombarded with #hashtags in the corridors of their social media through "smart phones." The peculiar irony is that we are literally walking through corridors of an exhibition, only this one is continuous and never stops. Today we can find ourselves immersed in a surreal abundance of images, stories, and projections, where everything captivates us after a sensational narrative, not to say visceral. But unlike the impactful experience of that exhibition, which provoked deep reflection about our future, our modern 'exhibition' lacks utility not because the topics aren't amazing. Much of what arises every second is incredible and promising. However, in today's overexposure, we are pulled to jump from section to section, page to page, message to message, too quickly and without time to digest.

Why to reflect and pause if you can go back to the supermarket. But the situation is that the generalist mindset falls into a mechanized approach for entrepreneurship in the face of the urgent, frenetic, fast-paced, world of entrepreneurship; where being faster is coherent and goes well with good reasons to move fast, in the aisles of all categories that offers knowlege, role models, stories, data, prospects, methodologies, data, support systems, acceleration chambers, boosters, passes, gift cards, free coupons, investing access, and more. Entering the path of entrepreneurship can become like one in front of a full breakfast buffet where you can eat anything and pick all that you want. When we start, and across the paths and need to growth, the full colored buffet is there, and the crew can always pick more, among all colors and flavors. And worse of all, entrepreneurship rises from a hungry spirit. And worse of all, entrepreneurship resets the crew to accept that digestion problems are just part of the equation. Entrepreneurship calls for growth and growth supports the call to action, to eat more, to shop more. 

In other words, in the turbulence of our hyperconnected world, we become less prone to deep reflections as we compelled to experience things superficially. In this context, journalist Johann Hari, in "Stolen Focus," challenges us to reflect on how the overexposure to information generally reduces our attention: According to a study cited in the book, and published in the journal Nature (Hari, p.39-40, 2023), we can understand that social media contributes to decreased attention the more we are exposed to larger amounts of content. In other words, we might initially blame social media, but in doing so, we are blaming the internet, the telecommunications revolution, the telegraph, and the various means of transport that delivered letters.

Neste, sentido, consideremos outra dimensão sobre a aceleração do mundo, como apresentada por Johann Hari, em 'Foco Roubado'. Johann nos convida a considerar o impacto da abundância de informações sobre a capacidade da sociedade de manter a atenção. Hari destaca uma pesquisa de 

> "Foi a primeira prova obtida de que o espectro de nossa atenção coletiva vem encolhendo. Um fato crucial é que isso está acontecendo não apenas desde o surgimento da web, mas ocorreu durante toda a minha vida, a vida dos meus pais e dos meus avós. Sim, a internet trouxe uma rápida aceleração da tendência - mas o fato crucial é a descoberta feita por essa equipe científica de que esta não é a única causa" (Hari, p.40, 2023).

É paradoxal porque temos muito mais informações e ferramentas, de qualidade de fato, na nossa frente do que antes. O que deveria ser um fator para só nos proporcionar melhores chances. E essa ideia nos convence bem, temos que concordar já que temos hoje muitos mais dados, mais confirmações, mais depoimentos, referências, depoimentos, etc. Porém, diante de uma explosão de soluções - como processos, ferramentas e métodos - nossa atenção também passa a ser limitada e acabamos dependendo de nosso instinto para julgar e decidir. Em outras palavras, estamos condicionados - pelo próprio ambiente empreendedor - para navegar rápido e acabamos decidindo no que chamamos de decisões informadas mas que de fato ocorrem com base em nálises superficiais na frente de narrativas que calham na momento certo. 

No entanto, os empreendedores que tentam executar seus processos continuam caindo nas armadilhas neste ambiente que ficou acelerado onde a priorização da execução é o lema. Eles correm em cima de plataformas  leves que projetam esperança para objetivos promissores. Nessas condições, não é fácil perceber que o ritmo que o sistema empreendedor os condiciona, ainda mais no ambiente hiperconectado, diante de uma infinidade de tecnologias, métodos, abordagens, sistemas - tudo prometendo apoiar as decisões. 

#### Bundled us 

We, as entrepreneurs, who strive to change the world and our lives, recognize the complexities of navigating a stormy sea. But like any environment that needs to change, we don't have time to adjust our routine. We are bound to the pace of acceleration, to the urgent drumbeat, the pressure of speed. We are pushed to decide, to move forward. Consider, for example, how we are bombarded by a torrent of information, we are immersed in constant overexposure that submerges us in a sea of choices. THe channels you subscribe, the newspapers that you read. Systems and networks shape behaviors on a large scale and pressure us to decide, with data, with what we think as "good reasons," empowering us to the next step. In this environment, entrepreneurs might see themselves as protagonists, empowered to execute faster with a feeling of certainty to an iminent success; 

But the dive into the situation we live show the projections of the order - as it seems - at all levels, such as management levels, where the management of entrepreneurship is not out of the forces. Thus, how we act and behave is always a symptom of bring framed, or victim of the accelerated environment, that not only might suck their project's potential but their energy. The ranges of what can go on with the too fast mover goes from wasting resources to just launching things that are not useful on top of existing platforms without reconsidering that a lot of what is out there is a created reality in the first place.  

#### Why for entrepreneurs, what kind of 

But why a book geared towards entrepreneurs? First, because we are all entrepreneurs, even if we're just navigating our own lives. Second, entrepreneurs who strive to better the world are the ones genuinely in need to improve entrepreneurship itself. In other words, the impact of entrepreneurship feeds back into a more appropriate approach to both entrepreneurship and management. This book, for instance, arose from my learning experiences rooted in the work of individuals - such as managers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners - who inspired me as they champion a more conscious form of entrepreneurship. Thus, this book is a culmination of lessons learned, but it also stands as an accessible resource, an organized body of knowledge, spurring debate. Even though it might be finalized in editions, it remains fluid in terms of knowledge and inspiration in a broader discussion. Third, according to Maslow (1998, p.232), entrepreneurs warrant attention because they play key roles in societies:

> “*If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly Entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” (Maslow, 1998, p.232)

Maslow's message reinforces a perspective that helps us identify the role of the entrepreneur, a role that transcends any specialist role. Therefore, entrepreneurship is way of conduct that trancends our specialist identities and acknowledges the need for continuous learning, an essential element for planning any project involving innovation. Let's embark on our journey, which begins with introspection for navigating our connected, fast-paced world.

In this regard, support for the entrepreneurial role is support for a reflective moment as an opportunity to  understanding of navigation, organization, productivity, conscious entrepreneurship. For entrepreneurs, interested in being around, for their lasting business or as professionals. A call for slowing down has more to do with the needs reflective character that respects the self, and respect the new cycles too. It is by respecting creative destruction process, its powerful magnificent power - that solidifies a reality that recycles the economic order - is about respecting the new order, the new platofrm, new rules; up to the point of recognizing the abundance of options of now, modern entrepreneurship, and including any traps we might be into it. We are bundled in the package of now. Respect that what destroyed, prior order, was creatively destroyed. Respect that first shall lead us to respect ourselves as the beings that can free ourselves. See, it is not easy to see the needs to free ourselves which might lead to innovation, truly. In order to see problems, you have to be into the reflective state to see things as problematic. I have considered that, with the many resources that were light to my perosnal path, brought me to see the bundled situation, the mechanized world; and a need for us to move our entrepreneurship with a willingness to unbundle things, such as the pathways of entrepreneurship. 

This moment of reflection becomes somewhat urgent because the act of entrepreneurship starts with motivation but generates the potential for action towards innovation. I am grateful that you are engaging with this material, as the articles gathered here promote conscious entrepreneurship in this era of urgencies and pitfalls that besiege the act of embarking on entrepreneurial ventures. This brief pause is for the entrepreneur to become a better protagonist and less a victim of the world's pressing agendas. In this sense, it provides support so that we can navigate towards our dreams without inadvertently becoming victims of the accelerated environment of entrepreneurship, which can be cruel and devastating.
