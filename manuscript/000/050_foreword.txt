# Preface #

This is a book about urgency because it is crucial for us to urgently address the way we engage in doing things too quickly, and how we waste a lot of energy, time, and resources. I ask that you use this moment for reflection. First, I want us to feel the way we find ourselves on the path of urgency, a treadmill that runs, that carries us. And then, I want us to reflect on our automatic behaviors and the many things we do in autopilot mode. And then, I wish for us to advance our objectives with a healthier process, a not-so-urgent process. We can't walk through time, but we can change how we interpret what happens in time. With this, I invite you to go back in time, before we fast-forward, before we slow down, before we decelerate, before we win.

On November 10, 1876, the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, activated the gigantic Corliss engine during the opening of the centennial exhibition of the United States' independence in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. The engine, titled Corliss Centennial Engine, became the icon of the exhibition. Standing 14 meters tall and with a power of 1400 hp, it was responsible for powering the entire structure of the exhibition, which contained more than 200 buildings scattered across 5 km. (Wikipedia, 2019)

According to historian Maury Klein (2008), the exhibition showcased all the modern wonders of industrial revolution mechanization: machines that prepared molds for printing machines, sewing machines, telegraph devices, locomotives, automatic saws, belt presses, winches, scales, excavators, drilling machines, giant sugar mills, cotton presses, stone crushing machines, diamond drills, stone cutters, various tools, agricultural equipment, carriages, tile and brick making machines, binding machines, paper and cardboard making machines, thread making machines, cable and screw production, car wheels, train wheels, and much more. Machines.

These elements, fruits of human labor and collaboration, many at the time materialized as mechanical solutions, were at the epicenter of a change that would alter the economic order, accelerating the destruction of previous economic models and launching new work platforms, new economic systems that would create the conditions for future revolutions.

In other words, the world, from this landmark, became more accelerated. Things got faster. It is impossible to discuss the industrial revolution without mentioning a parallel, yet deeply interconnected, story that involves the end of slavery. The Pennsylvania exhibition, inaugurated by the Corliss engine and attested by the Emperor of Brazil Dom Pedro II, was a vivid example of the rising new economic order. Based on technological innovation and the force of free labor, this new economy was rapidly accelerating, particularly in the Northern United States. At the same time, there were still regions, especially in the Southern United States, where the old economic order, based on slavery, persisted. These two 'worlds' were on a collision course, and the industrial revolution, among other factors, contributed to accelerating the destruction of the old system based on slavery and the emergence of a new system based on freedom and innovation.

This new pace, this new order, changing the rules of work with an economic system, is an exemplary case of a process known as Creative Destruction [^creativedestruction], which would lead to other revolutions.

[^creativedestruction]: Creative Destruction is a concept proposed by economist Joseph Schumpeter that describes the process of transformation that accompanies radical innovation. According to Schumpeter, successful business innovations result in the destruction of old economic arrangements and the creation of new ones. This can cause significant disruptions, but it is a necessary and vital force for long-term economic development. 

If you were sent back in time, back to that 1876 exhibition, you would need a full week to appreciate, superficially, everything. But back to the future, a modern report done in a tweet [^tweet] could likely use the hashtag #SurrealAbundance. 

[^tweet]: According to ChatGPT, "A tweet is a post or status update on Twitter, a popular social media platform. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, a tweet can contain up to 280 characters. Characters can include letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces. URLs, regardless of their actual length, are automatically shortened by Twitter and usually count as 23 characters.

Back in the days, only the 10 million who could physically travel to Philadelphia were able to experience firsthand the what would become accelerated rhythm of the new world.

This new order, faster and more laborious, created conditions that indeed catapulted us into an actual surreal abundance. But what is the difference today? Today, with the major world exhibitions practically extinct, people are likely following modern experiences through #hashtags and keywords on their smartphones. We live today a peculiar irony - although we are not literally walking through the corridors of a 19th-century exhibition, we are immersed in a surreal abundance. 

However, unlike that time, our modern 'exhibition' puts you in a place flooded by information, flooded with fragments of data, and flooded in a place of not knowing what to choose to read, to watch, to feel, to digest. This constant overexposure submerges us in a sea of options, where systems and networks shape behaviors on a scale, thus creating new 'prisons'. That thankful Creative Destruction process, which indeed dismantled that old order and the system based on slavery, has brought us a new order with new challenges to be solved. 

But the challenges and the focus here is not to spark your interest to solve our new world challenges such as the rise of temperature in our planet, the rise of unhealthy lifestyle, and accelerated destruction of the nature, and a lot more that goes on in this new heated place. The challenges and the theme is for the founder and the modern entrepreneur interested in launching the ideas. The founder that is part of this new world and new order that sets a pressure for acceleration, that sets us in a constant flood of information. The ones that might be accelerating their goals without having time to reflect about what they do and how they do. 

This book deals with issues such as the steps of entrepreneurs in the modern world, about navigating the complex sea of processes, technologies, solutions, and information. But it is not made for any random visitor, even if it is valid material for anyone interested in reflecting on and organizing their thoughts about navigation, organization, productivity, and the pursuit of success or innovation.

The audience here is the entrepreneur who may or may not even find themselves confused in the urgent agenda to launch their ideas into the world. So this is yet another book about entrepreneurship among so many others, on physical or electronic shelves. I hope you have found it because it gathers articles that promote more conscious entrepreneurship in this age of urgencies and traps that besiege entrepreneurship. Above all, the goal of the book is reflection, so that the entrepreneur can be a better protagonist and less a victim of the urgent agendas of the world. In this sense, it wants to help entrepreneurs navigate towards their dreams, becoming less a victim of abundance that can be a cruel and devastating environment.

But why a book aimed at entrepreneurs? First, because we are all entrepreneurs, even if only of our lives. Second, entrepreneurs who work to modify the world for the better are the ones who are indeed trying to modify the world of entrepreneurship for the better. That is, the effect of entrepreneurship can be to fuel a system for a better world. This book, for example, was only born from my learning based on the work of people who inspired me because they are great examples. In this sense, the book is the result of my own learning and also becomes an available resource and organized knowledge that becomes a debate. It is versioned, immutable perhaps in some of its impressions—but not immutable in that it is knowledge that can be observed, studied, modified. Third, according to Abraham Maslow (????, p.232), the entrepreneur deserves attention because they are key pieces in societies:

> If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly Entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc." Abraham Maslow, P.232, Maslow on Management (????, p.232)
