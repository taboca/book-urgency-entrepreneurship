# Foreword

On November 10, 1876, the emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II, activated the massive Corliss engine during the opening of the United States Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The engine, dubbed the Corliss Centennial Engine, became the icon of the exhibition. Standing 14 meters tall and boasting a power of 1400 horsepower, it was responsible for powering the entire exhibition's structure that comprised more than 200 buildings scattered across the 5-kilometer expanse of the exhibition. (Wikipedia, 2019)

According to historian Maury Klein (2008), the exhibition showcased all the modern marvels of the industrial revolution's mechanization: machines that prepared molds for printing presses, sewing machines, telegraph devices, locomotives, automatic saws, belt presses, winches, scales, excavators, drilling machines, gigantic sugarcane mills, cotton presses, stone-crushing machines, diamond drillers, stone cutters, various tools, agricultural equipment, carriages, tile and brick making machines, bookbinding machines, paper-making machines, cardboard-making machines, thread making machines, cable-making machines, screw-making machines, car wheels, train wheels, and much more. Machines.

These elements, fruits of human labor and collaboration, many of which were materialized as mechanical solutions at the time, were at the epicenter of a change that would disrupt the economic order, accelerating the destruction of earlier economic models and launching new work platforms, new economic systems that would set the stage for future revolutions (to be reviewed) - not to mention that these elements were in the middle of a parallel but not isolated story involving the end of slavery.

The world, from this point onwards, sped up. Things became faster. A new rhythm for the order of work created conditions for the next stages in the process of creative destruction that would bring about other revolutions. Since then, we have experienced a few others, such as the telecommunications revolution. (To be checked)

For a simple visitor to the exhibition, a week's visit was not enough. Perhaps one phrase - surreal abundance - could be today's impactful hashtag. Unfortunately, few were able to witness such abundance of solutions, as only 10 million people could physically travel to see and experience the elements that defined the new pace of the world.

With the quicker pace and more work, this new order created conditions that led us, in fact, to surreal abundance. The difference with today? It was 5 hectares of expanse that could be consumed in 7 days. Today, with the major world exhibitions extinct, people are confined to seeing, or rather following, modern experiences via hashtags and keywords—through the screen of a cell phone. The problem now is that we are living a subtle version of the terrifying centennial exhibition of the 19th century - what to visit amidst this surreal abundance.

In the world, the exhibition is never turned off and creates conditions for people to get lost in the vastness of options.

This book deals with issues of abundance and navigating the complex sea of technologies, solutions, and information. But it wasn't made for any random visitor, even though it's valid material for anyone interested in reflecting on and organizing their senses about navigation, organization, and productivity.

The audience here is the entrepreneur who may also often find themselves confused in the urgent agenda to launch their ideas to the world. So, this is yet another book on entrepreneurship among so many others on physical or electronic shelves. I hope you found it because it brings together articles that promote more conscious entrepreneurship in this era of urgencies and traps that besiege the entrepreneur. The objective of the book is reflection, so that the entrepreneur can be a better protagonist and less a victim of the world's urgent agendas. In this sense, it aims to help entrepreneurs navigate towards their dreams, becoming less victimized by the abundance that can be a cruel and devastating environment.

But why a book geared towards entrepreneurs? First, everyone is an entrepreneur, even if only of their own life. Second, entrepreneurs who work to improve the world are the ones who consequently improve the world of entrepreneurship. In other words, the effect of entrepreneurship self-feeds a machine that makes the world better. This book, for instance, was only born from my learning that was based on the work of people who inspired me because they are great examples. In this sense, the book is the result of my own learning and also becomes an available resource and organized knowledge that turns into a debate. It's versioned, perhaps immutable in some of its impressions—but not immutable in the matter that it's knowledge that can be observed, studied, and modified. Third, according to Abraham Maslow (????, p.232), entrepreneurs deserve attention because they are key pieces in societies:

> If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly Entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc.*” Abraham Maslow, P.232, Maslow on Management (????, p.232)
