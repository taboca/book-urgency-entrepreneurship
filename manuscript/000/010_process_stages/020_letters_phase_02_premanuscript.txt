## Letter to Julia Cameron

* Thanks for the morning pages process and The Right to Write. 

```
Hi Julia, 

This is Marcio S Galli, I have written before after I felt that your voice and mind and heart and spirit - you name it - had changed my life. Then you did it again, and again. When writing the morning pages, most of them I start with "With Julia Cameron," and then some others I had brought with us Dorothea Brande for example. 

From now I could go to any direction here, if I let my mind or heart of spirit to take off. But the reason that I wanted to write to you today is something else. I have noticed that The Right to Write after The Artist's Way was a great next step for one to become a more complete person (writer if you will). But then, in my country (Brazil), The Right to Write is not available in Portuguese. 

I think that we should do that. I am not sure; perhaps this may come as yet another request for you and your team. And know how busy you are. But in case you see a chance for this to be real, for the sake of helping people from Brazil, in special, and many others that read Portuguese, I then wish the best energies for that to happen. And within that possibility, if you ever need some help or notes or a voice, please let me know. I am not a translator - I am just a Brazilian who had his life changed, and recovered, thanks to your wisdom and way you have conducted. 

Sincerely, 

Marcio

PS: The form option, through the site, using "Ask Julia" leads to a message of error, "Failed to send your message. Please try later or contact the administrator by another method." I am guessing from that that too many people are giving up writing as they do not know the trick I did here, to actually try other options in the form.

Um exemplo de colaboração, no livro, que volta naquele problema de procurar visão de fora, em qualquer contexto. Quando mando para alguém, um trecho do livro, alguém dá um comentário. Daria para ouvir, reouvir, tentar ver em perspectiva, etc. Ou daria para ignorar e se defender também. Ainda, sabemos, que normalmente todo e qualquer comentário se aplica em algum contexto. Então o problema é o contexto, também. 

Um caso: Eu enviei um texto, que era uma versão X de uma carta-convite apresentando o livro, tipo para investidores ou celebridades, pré-convidando eles. Em uma dessas interações, um ex-colega da Mozilla enviou um review - de fato ele fez um grande review apontando vários problemas no texto. Na pressão, suposta ou real, de responder eu encontrei uma certa tensão. Ou iria pegar muito leve, algum ponto menor acatado, ou talvez até ignorar e falar que não se aplicava porque XYZ. 

Mas tinha algo a mais que notei que diante da impossibilidade de um reply rápido mas mantendo em aberto. Neste meio tempo notei que eu estava carregando algumas questões que ele colocou. Como se eu tivesse de fato tentando resolver o ponto que ele comentou naquela carta. Masnão exatamente no contexto daquela carta introdutória. No caso eu acabei por umas 2 semanas resolvendo alguns pontos mas na Introdução do livro. Ou seja, para eu responder ele eu precisei editar e rever a introdução toda e até de certa forma alguns elementos do livro como um todo. 

Em outras palavras, como eu iria saber que a "pequena colaboração ou interação dele" iria  me levar a "travar" - por X semanas - e ter que resolver um problema mais fundamental? A razão que documentei isso, agora, é porque foi muito leve. É muito sutil e quase não percebi que eu estava tentando resolver uma outra coisa que me levaria então a chegar em mais qualidade naquela carta, em eventual revisão da carta. Não parece colaboração, nesta fase. Agora tendo refletido isso, eu notei uma intensa colaboração, até profunda, longe de pequenas interações do tipo, acatar algo simples (que parece colaboração) ou até se defender.

Nice to see your steps, Daniel. Congrats.

Hey, just to let you know of a state progress of a book I am working, entitled Slow Down to Start Up. I had this idea of this book around 2017 after watching the Blitzscaling lectures which I subtitled to pt-br two of them.
Then I got stuck, into the learnings, and understood something else from the Blitzscaling, a requirement, which had to do with a readiness level, as human beings before trying to make fast things to grow. Then from that, you know, I had moments of working and not working on it and life passing. But one year ago, the process took off (long story) and now I hit the mark of 260 days of writing work (Forest Gump style) and now I am hoping to achieve my initial manuscript by this summer or end of it or something.

Now where I am might be comparable with the grief phases which Andy mentioned, or the new sports metaphor of Brian Chesky. I am new in a new space, to make this a reality. Moreover, I have a dirt stone in my hands which I believe could be monumental to founders but too that if a bad editor or partner looks at it, he she may throw it in the garbage or fix it in bad ways.

In case you happen to see connecting dots here, let me know. I had pinged Chris Yeh who may, if he has time, try to look at parts of it when I launch. He gave a very soft yes as in "try to send to me. "

Hi Limarc, 

An update here, about my situation and this one carries a thank you note as well. 

I had now passed the mark of 260 days, as a writer (supportive process). To recap, this process started when I didn't take that fellowship you offered but created some other "self fellowship". A note, it required a leap of faith comparable with the one required to engage with your journey as planned by that fellowship. When I almost accepted yours, my mind saw the other too which was outstanding, the actual thing I wanted to do for years.  

The book content grew, it's a manuscript of 480 pages, almost close to the point of being done in the sense that all that I wanted to put out is out. A great deal of transformations had happened, if I had to pick one it would be about the acceptance of reducing interference from my inner critic,setting him aside. 

I would like to let you know if I get closer to the next process of completing this manuscript and if it gets hot with some special celebrities I am trying to show. Anyway this note is to contextualize to you what came from that moment and another note in particular: No ChatGPT.. You, and another special person, Barbara Minto, were the two key forces that helped me with that. To be fair, I use it to research, and also some temporary footnotes were made by it. But not to the text so that to take over my mind, my focus, and my ability to be a better writer. 

Ref to the theme and cover temporary  -  https://leanpub.com/slowdowntostartup  - not meant for purchase or download since I use leanpub for producing content. 

Thanks for helping me to start a life towards being a writer, minimally in the sense of the shifts into the work of writing. 260 days within 360 days is something. 

Marcio
