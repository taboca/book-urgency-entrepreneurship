## Victim of the harvest - the challenges of urgent execution

There is a situation, usually good, related to harvesting the fruits of a creation - the feeling of success or indeed success measured by the external environment.

### (Creation from art)

Our manager may not be prepared. Thus, on the one hand it is worthy of a creation and on the other hand it is the same being, who manages all of this. Make no mistake - it is possible to have a successful life on the one hand and at the same time lead to success with a parallel account, poor management.

In fact, many of the artists in history produced their arts by generating waste, often even toxic, in parallel.


### (Anxiety that gushes creation but accumulates debts)

In fact, perhaps this issue is in fact a dilemma for artists and an issue that affects entrepreneurs as well. Author Julia Cameron, who specializes in helping artists cope with their blockages, revealed that she had lived through a time when her creativity spilled out, like a vein that spurts blood, and that among sparks of creativity she really needed to drink. It changed, rediscovered itself, started to try to manage its creativity, its production, so that production would not depend on this parallel cost, on this residual accumulation that it actually consumed.

### (Today, we need to better manage production)

Today, choreography is equally relevant in the entrepreneur's path. The entrepreneur then needs to break down into multiple roles.

### (The neglect bias)

In a debate, journalist Nome (from Band News, now an anchor) was asked about the true cost of corruption - does the value of what is stolen really matter? He replied that the value is "money for the pharmacy" which is not so relevant. That in fact what costs most to everyone is the intention of those involved in the art of planning it all; an invested time that should be invested better, in this case the agenda was government so he articulated that the social benefit is the biggest loss with people busy in creating creative solutions involving corruption.

This in-depth look suggests a parallel for entrepreneurs - who says - that those who start to get involved with certain urgent actions, such as managing by putting out fires, fail to focus on other important actions, which could for example prevent fires in the first place.

In other words, tactical actions without strategy can lead to an unsustainable routine.

### (The entrepreneur leaves the design, or redesign, aside)

Perhaps at some point, entrepreneurs stop being proactive and become reactive. They take care of what is "in the air", what is working with customers, in responding to demands - something that is relevant and worthy, because executing is important.

But it is not enough. Not only that, a blind execution where the entrepreneur expects that the reactive execution will solve the structural problems. The problem with reactive execution is that execution leads the entrepreneur to a way of executing that governs his own way of thinking, involves, embraces. This in theory should be good but it means that this practice makes the entrepreneur govern with a managerial mind, super conscious, who monitors everything, who is alert, who does the math, who is concerned. And that shouldn't be a problem either, except that the skills for these actions are different from the skills of creation that are equally necessary as they solve deeper problems, create shortcuts, lead to more innovative solutions.

When the entrepreneur dedicates 100% of his time to the reactive mode, to put out fires and manage the demand of the present, he starts to act like someone who changed the way of operating, entered the harvest mode, and leaves aside the art of sowing, or re-sowing, or working on the fertile issue, which is a way of saying that strategy has been left out.

The urgency of execution naturally calls for the neglect bias - in fact, the entrepreneur's own success, even if temporary, creates a blindness that leads him to ignore the need to reconsider his own practices. The focus on the harvest becomes the focus - I need to save the harvest or if I don't take care of the harvest, there won't be the next harvest. This is not very wrong - but it is serious to do just that, precisely because adversities will always be present - the entrepreneur must go one step ahead, he must parallelize.

### (Practical example)

Imagining a normal scenario - the entrepreneur spends time sowing, preparing the ground, his fertile soil. He waters his breeding and soon engages in harvesting issues - taking care of selling, taking care of support, resolving emergencies. He notes that the initial strategic actions worked, he knows how to measure his success. At the same time, it observes some problems, that is, it plans for an operational machine or actions to reap the rewards to be efficient; therefore, their actions now need to take care of small fires such as problems with the exchange of goods due to the percentage of damaged products, default problems (non-paying customers), problems with communication with suppliers, etc. But in the governing, alert and conscious way, he assumes that these actions are part of the process - he doesn't reevaluate, he doesn't have time. The conclusion he reaches is of the type - I will increase sales, sales, and consequently the profit will bring the results I need. With more profit I will have more scope to take care of these problems - I can put an intern there, I can hire another professional to answer the calls for support with problematic clients.

This is an idea that says - if I earn more I can use that extra money to compensate. This way of acting is perhaps more natural than we imagine, perhaps because our tendency is to separate the strategic (sowing) from the tactical (harvesting) process. Perhaps we are still anxious, on the run, and therein lies the danger for entrepreneurs, because they account for losses as part of the process, they start to manage inconsistencies and emergencies as a responsibility - well, it would be irresponsible not to take care of the harvest problems. The problem? We forget that certain fires and issues would not need to exist in the first place, we no longer believe that we can change reality, the entrepreneur becomes a victim of his own initial success because the ruling, alert and conscious mind does not make room for the creative side.

The entrepreneur never accepts, for example, to reconsider whether his clients are the correct clients. Once the harvest is done, the reality is immutable.

With this he accelerates these actions even more, and makes it official that he should earn more, even accounting for emergencies officially. The business depends on a little fat, a profit that pays for these emergencies. Hence with scale comes a critical problem. The entrepreneur is busy, much of his time with the management of putting out fires and these problems, and this whole time, or part of it, could be time for a release.
