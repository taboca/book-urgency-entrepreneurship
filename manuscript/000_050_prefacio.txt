# Foreword

On November 10, 1876, the emperor of Brazil Dom Pedro II activated the giant motor Corliss, during the inauguration of the exhibition of the centenary of the independence of the United States, in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. The engine, entitled * Corliss Centennial Engine *, became the icon of the exhibition. With 14 meters in height and power of 1400 hp, he was responsible for maintaining the entire structure of the position, which had more than 200 buildings spread over the 5 km of the exhibition. (Wikipedia, 2019)

According to the historian Maury Klein (2008), the exhibition brought all the modern wonders of the mechanization of the industrial revolution: machines that prepared the molds for printing machines, sewing machines, telegraph devices, locomotives, automatic saws, printing presses. belts, winches, scales, excavators, drilling machines, giant cane mills, cotton press, stone crushing machines, diamond drilling machines, stone cutters, various tools, agricultural equipment, coaches, roofing and brick building machines, binding machines, paper-making machines, cardboard, wire-making machines, cables, screws, car wheels, train wheels, and much more. Machines.

These elements, fruits of labor and human collaboration, many at the time materialized as mechanical solutions, were at the epicenter of a change that would alter the economic order, accelerating the destruction of previous economic models and launching new work platforms, new economic systems that would create the conditions for future revolutions (revise) - not to mention that these elements were in the middle of the stage of a parallel but not isolated history involving the end of slavery.

The world, from this milestone, became more accelerated. Things got faster. A new rhythm for the work order created conditions for the new stages in the process of creative destruction that would bring other revolutions. Since then, we have gone through some others, such as the telecommunications revolution. (Check this)

For a simple visitor to the exhibition, a week's visit was not enough. Perhaps an expression - surreal abundance - could be the #hashtag of impact if it were today. Unfortunately, few were able to see such an abundance of solutions since only 10 million people were able to physically move around to see and feel the elements that defined the new pace of the world.

With the quickest step and the most work this new order created conditions that led us in fact to surreal abundance. The difference with today? there were 5 bushels of extension that could be consumed in 7 days. Today, with the great world exhibitions gone, people are confined to seeing, or better following, modern experiences via #hashtags and keywords - on the mobile screen. The problem today is that we are experiencing a subtle version of the appalling 19th century century exhibition - what to visit in the midst of this surreal abundance.

In the world, the exhibition is never turned off and creates the conditions for people to be lost in the immensity of options.

This book deals with issues of abundance and navigation in the complex sea of technologies, solutions and information. But it was not made for any random visitor, even if it is valid material for anyone interested in reflecting and organizing the senses about navigation, organization and productivity.

The audience here is the entrepreneur who can also find himself often confused on the urgent agenda to launch his ideas to the world. So this is another book about entrepreneurship among so many others, on physical or electronic shelves. I hope you found it because it brings together articles that promote more conscious entrepreneurship in this era of urgencies and pitfalls that beset the entrepreneur. The objective of the book is a reflection, so that the entrepreneur can be a better protagonist and less victim of the urgent agendas of the world. In this sense, it wants to help entrepreneurs navigate the path of their dreams, becoming less a victim of the abundance that can be a cruel and devastating environment.

But why a book aimed at the entrepreneur? First, everyone is an entrepreneur, even in their own life. Second, entrepreneurs who work to change the world for the better are those who consequently change the world of entrepreneurship for the better. That is, the effect of self-entrepreneurship feeds a machine that makes the world a better place. This book, for example, was only born from my learning that was based on the work of people who inspired me because they are great examples. In this sense, the book is the result of my own learning and also becomes an available resource and organized knowledge that becomes a debate. It is versioned, immutable perhaps in some of its impressions - but not immutable in the matter of knowledge that can be observed, studied, modified. Third, according to Abraham Maslow (????, p.232) the entrepreneur deserves attention because they are key pieces in societies:

> If you had a challenge to bring 100 people to a deteriorating society, the best category of professionals to bring are certainly Entrepreneurs, in contrast with politicians, professors, engineers, etc. [^maslow100people].
