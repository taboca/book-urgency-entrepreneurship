## PR For early stage

This article was written based in my study from [How to Hack PR for Your Startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjTQKEbNv2k) by Founder Institute. This webinar was presented by Adeo Ressi and Conrad Egusa, the CEO of Publicize.

All opinions here are my own interpretation based in the video interview — please report if you see that I should improve my writing.

The goal of their interview webinar was to help startup entrepreneurs in how they can establish their PR strategies and actions. And they do this initially bringing up the common PR misconceptions, such as the belief that it's not important to have connections with journalists in order to get media coverage. Conrad adds that if you focus in the process you can get a lot of results.

Conrad told a story of when he wrote in the name of another CEO — using the other CEO's e-mail. And that CEO had no connections. So, as he was communicating he was not getting results and even himself got confused about the effectiveness of his process. But later, after some period of time, the actual CEO tells Conrad that results were really nice. It turns out that all the reply e-mails were being received by the actual CEO, of course!

### Timing

Before they got into the core of Conrad's points, the F.A.M.O.U.S. process, Adeo brought a question from the audience about **timing** — when PR is important. For Conrad, it's really important to look for PR when you have an actual product. It's the waiting for prime time, notion. Adeo adds that it is a customer acquisition vehicle so it requires to have a product.

So the time to use PR depends on how much it costs your PR strategy and the users that you get with it. In general, the big PR firms will charge tens of thousands of dollars, so those would be appropriate for late series A or B companies. Your own PR, or a cheaper PR strategy, may well be suitable to your early stage business.

## Before the F.A.M.O.U.S. process, get your company PR friendly

First things first. For Conrad, you need a great design, from the beginning. This has to do with how you are to grab attention of others, these others that will talk about you, such as reporters. As they all get a lot of request, you need to be aware about the time they will have to perceive your product and experience. Therefore, think about all the communication — how you design everything from your site to product to words to motivation to goals and more.

# Process F.A.M.O.U.S.

This section was also elaborated based in the process guided by Adeo with answers provided by Conrad.

### Formulate

The first important thing is to have something to announce when you contact a media. You won't be entering in contact asking them to write about your company as if you have not something specific and you want them to write simply about it, or, in case you have something specific it would mean that you are asking them to do the hard work for you. Instead, you want to be specific if you have, in first place, something formulated, something that is worth writing about.

When you have something real, a real launch of your product or a real achievement of a milestone, you then will have a package of information that they can refer to, that they can use, as data, as they write about it.

Conrad asks us to formulate with the mindset that is oriented to the announcements. So, for example, for your next 2-3 months, you ask yourself – hey, what announcement can I make to the media?

### Categories of announcements

Traditional examples, for categories of announcements, would be events such as launching, funding, milestones, and acquisitions. Obviously, the milestones category is more like your chance to be creative and to come up with formulas that may be related to the growth of your startup. Some of their examples are:

* My company just reached 20.000 thousand users;
* My company came up with a new study that unveils something new;

Conrad added that milestones has also to do with the ways that you need to find to continuously have something to be mentioned.

At [Brian Chesky, and the Challenges of Scaling Airbnb](https://youtu.be/W608u6sBFpo?t=9m46s), Reid Hofmann interviews Brian and asks about their efforts in the early days. Brian replies that they kept launching Airbnb because their launches was not globally known. Brian remarks that "if you launch it and no one notices it, you can actually just keep launching." Brian also acknowledges that they were also learning with the launches. At their 3rd launch, at SxSw, he asked himself why does it have to be in a airbed? (the original Airbnb idea in fact offered cheap airbeds for a customer stay near conferences). The requirement of a conference was also another point that was revisited. Brian story creates an alignment between these iterations – product milestones being delivered for real customers, the need for PR aiming to create awareness, and the presence of founders. This model creates a good iteration supporting founders to learn quickly, about their communication and about how customers are interacting with their product, therefore supporting them to make changes for their future milestones.

### Amplify

This is your need to go and see beyond, your goals for the years ahead. You need to connect what you have now with what you want to achieve in the years in the future. An effective amplification will have more traction in media.

Adeo mentioned that the Founder institute helped to launch the idea of the convertable equity, an amplification which he says that "we fixed the structural weakness of startups with convertible equity vehicle."

### Messaging

Messaging is broken in two parts: **message pitch** and **message press release**. The message pitch is the initial communication which is short and aimed to call attention of your PR audience.

#### E-mail pitch

First, you need to keep your e-mail short — under 200 words.

Secondly you need to have structure for your journalists audience. A key element is to introduce yourself with social proof. If you are an influential entrepreneur, you present that credential upfront. If not, you need to find your spot or a way to position yourself so that they will read it and be interested. Adeo have illustrated with an example. He imagined a nurse would write that she does nursing at home and that she invented a nursing app, and so on. Conrad also indicates that journalists are very much concerned about the veracity of stories. Therefore, you need to structure the information in a way to help them to check things further easily. As an example, add a link to your linkedIn profile — let them know the connections you have or the companies that you have worked before, for example.

Another point is that journalists do get a lot of spam. Therefore, you need to be aware of that to write your e-mail in a way that differentiates it out of the massive amount of data that they receive.

Adeo asks Conrad about the balance between the personal story and the product story – if a message mainly focused in product would be worse than a balanced message that has the story of founder plus the story of the product. Conrad remarks that you can resolve such balance situation via positioning more the part that is more relevant or more sexy. That if one is much more than the other, you can add more into that.

#### Press release component

The press release component is in fact the hard work that you have to do so that your target journalist does not have to do that work of investigation in regards to all that is needed to be convinced and to have good enough data to write about it. You need to get the data ready for them so they can quickly write about it. As Adeo puts it — you are not selling and you are in fact doing the work for them.

Conrad adds that an average rate, for journalists writing articles cities such as New York city or San Francisco, is about US$ 20.00 per hour. His main point is that you have to know how journalists work so that you can help them. If you know, for example, that they will prefer the pieces that they can write in less than one hour, you would know that you need to have the data good enough to enable them to do that.

Regarding your message, you need to assume that reporters won't read your whole long story or more than a couple paragraphs. So, if there is something important, you need to move that upfront.

Regarding the user of data, avoid things like "this is a big market". You need to be specific with reference to the data in a way that helps them to find the references and to understand the relevance. Conrad illustrated the kind of language that reporters are interested and use in their articles: according to this study, this market is going to be X Y Z in these few years. This goes back to the idea that you are helping them to help you — you are using their language and making a lot of hard work so they can easily or quickly decide to move on with your story.



#### On communicating events - the e-mail follow up

Another tip, from Conrad, is to attempt to do a follow up writing if you get no response — but limit yourself to one follow up after your original e-mail. He claims that a secondary follow up have improved a lot the results of the communication for the case of e-mails — the ones that do not have direct channel of communication with journalists.

 ## Outreach

You need to be clear if you are looking for giving exclusivity for a given publisher. Conrad recommends that if it is your case, you need to communicate properly to them and to say upfront that you are looking for that kind of relationship and put a expiration date in the offer. Another point is to do this process in serial and not in parallel — as you do not want to have such exclusive offer to be accepted by more than one publisher.

The other approach for outreach is the embargo "contract." In this situation, you request the information to not be published until a certain moment happens — say your company is going to announce something big for the next week, then you can propose an embargo. The embargo is more commonly used for companies after seed — companies that are further down the road and are announcing more major milestones in comparison with early stage milestones of achievements. Adeo simplifies it — the bigger the news, embargo. As for milestones, and related things, exclusive.

### Unrelenting

Do contact as many publications as possible. Do not focus in one specific niche of publication that you found as being the place to be shown. Remember that big publications may also be interested — write to all of them. Notice that, for major channel spaces, such as the following list:

* https://www.producthunt.com
* https://techcrunch.com
* https://www.reddit.com
* http://www.venturebeat.com

You may well look for the curators of channels, such as moderators, to submit your stories. This may also be important for the platforms which you can submit yourself, such as product hunt, reddit, etc.

Adeo brings an interesting question regarding the mode **unrelenting** versus **exclusive**, which is a concern related to the time that it takes for the effort in order to generate results, since "the exclusive" approach may demand a lot of time. Conrad agrees that you may beed more time when aiming for exclusive — and to give a window of time, such as 24 hours, for them to comply, so that you can move on.

### Strategize

Conrad finds that the strongest companies makes announcements every 8 to 12 weeks. On the other hand, startups may launch things and keep a long time without announcing it. The ideal scenario is to be "optimising for PR", so not to lose the opportunities that exist along the road.

In a way it's like having your "PR mindset" to act like an internal stakeholder — that is waiting to consume and to push out new features and milestones in a way that is also compatible with all the other iterative processes that nowadays are being used and which allow startups to deliver quickly (think of Customer Development, Design Thinking, Agile, and more.) If your startup is able to produce quickly, to learn quickly, to sell quickly, and to evolve quickly; then why not to have its outreach strategies to perform at the same level too.

Conrads adds that this model is interesting for companies because it compounds over time. He believes that, for early stage, in the short run; the PR may underperform other forms of interaction such as advertising. But in the long run it will outperform these.

## My closing thoughts

The fact that he brings such notion, of the compound value, makes a lot of sense because what a startup really wants is a traction that finds a sweet spot — the space of traction — and via working through PR, a startup may actually detect and learn more. What I am reading from all this study is that we are talking about lean PR — a model of interaction with publishers and the media industry, in which we are trying to communicate with them. They are the signal filters when you are trying to break into the membrane of the market. If it passes through that, it passed into a new level which will allow you to have even more reading and data — interaction with a larger set of potential customers, reviewers, critics, developers, analysis, and more.
